"Sister to Sister:Helping Low-Income Women Quit Smoking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use is strongly linked to coronary heart disease (CHD), the leading cause of death in women. African American women of lower socioeconomic status are known to have high smoking rates, disparities in smoking related diseases, and difficulty with cessation. Despite these inequities, sparse data exist describing effective interventions targeted to this population. Although not evaluated in African American women, research supports that intensive group tobacco cessation interventions produce the highest quit rates (24 - 48 percent) over self help (7 - 11 percent) and brief interventions (13 - 16 percent) with other populations. Social support and informal extended kin network, particularly with lay health advisors (LHA), are beneficial in targeted behavioral interventions to African American women for other risk reduction measures such as breast cancer screening; however this approach has not been effectively evaluated with tobacco cessation. With further exploration and knowledge, the investigator's goal is to develop and implement a nurse/LHA-managed smoking cessation intervention tentatively entitled, Sister To Sister: Helping Low-Income Women Quit Smoking. The proposed intervention will target mediating variables of social support, self-efficacy, and adaptive coping mechanisms utilizing an intensive group intervention managed by a nurse and LHA. A community advisory group consisting of informal and formal community leaders will be formed to assist with the recruitment and retention of LHAs. Community partnership(s) with businesses, health agencies, churches, and other organizations will provide a representative to the advisory group and resources such as physical space and incentives for LHA.

"Transitions in Smoking Among Adolescent Minority Girls DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Although adolescent smoking has been a major national concern for many years, there is still relatively little known about its etiology among girls, particularly among young minority girls. While historically smoking rates were greater among males, gender differences in smoking are now virtually non-existent. Studies have demonstrated that at the same level of use, females are more likely to become dependent upon tobacco and are more likely to suffer from a variety of cancers than males, including a greater susceptibility to higher fatality forms of lung cancer. Minority women in particular appear to be at increased risk of developing smoking-related diseases. Therefore, although minority girls demonstrate the lowest rates of smoking during adolescence they may in fact be at highest risk for future smoking and for smoking-related problems. The current project would address existing gaps in the literature in a cost-effective manner through secondary analysis of largely minority, inner-city girls who participated in one of two school-based drug and violence prevention trial (N = 1,138 and N = 1,337). The primary goals of the proposed research are to improve our understanding of how smoking develops among urban minority girls and to examine transitional patterns of smoking behaviors among this population from middle school through high school. Secondary aims of the study are to investigate individual characteristics (i.e., household structure, religiosity, SES, pubertal timing) as potential moderators of the relationship between hypothesized risk factors and smoking as well as to examine relationships between smoking trajectories and indicators of health and well-being among this population. Finally, this study will compare and contrast smoking trajectories by racial/ethnic subgroups as well as examine potential cohort effects. The proposed study represents an important next step in the field of smoking etiology since it examines developmental transitions in smoking behaviors among a severely under-represented population (urban, minority adolescent girls) using state-of-the-art data analytic techniques. Findings from the proposed study will not only advance our understanding of smoking behaviors and transitions among minority girls, but will ultimately help develop and refine prevention efforts for this population and thereby decrease existing gender and racial/ethnic health disparities in the consequences of smoking.

"Intention to Quit Smoking Among Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  One of Healthy People 2010's (USDHHS, 2000) overarching health priorities includes eliminating health disparities among segments of the population, including disparities related to sexual orientation. Lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgender persons comprise a sexual orientation and gender identity minority known collectively as the LGBT community, or LGBT persons. Evidence strongly suggests that smoking prevalence is greater among lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons when compared to the general population. Smoking prevalence estimates are not available for transgender persons, but they share characteristics associated with higher smoking prevalence in the general population--lower socioeconomic status, high rates of depression, and high prevalence of substance abuse. High rates of smoking and the concentration of other health behaviors associated with greater cancer risk suggest that LGBT persons are at increased risk for certain cancers. The role of social-cognitive variables in understanding smoking, motivation to quit, and cessation is well-described for the general population and many special populations, but similar data are lacking for LGBT persons. Given the higher prevalence of smoking and the stigmatized social status of LGBT persons, it is likely that unique social-cognitive and contextual factors exist that are important in understanding their motivation to quit smoking and smoking patterns. Guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior and using qualitative interview and quantitative methodologies, this study will explore attitudes about quitting smoking, subjective norms (perceived social norms) for quitting, perceived behavioral control (self-efficacy) regarding quitting, and behavioral intention to quit among LGBT persons. In addition to theory-driven constructs, potentially important, LGBT-culture specific variables will be examined for their additive contribution to the variance in intention to quit smoking. Further, we will determine LGBT persons' preferences for delivery, format and provider characteristics in designing future smoking cessation interventions. If effective smoking cessation interventions are to be developed to address high smoking rates in the LGBT community, then culturally specific smoking cessation interventions should be informed by theory-driven research that supports targeting LGBT-specific factors, as well as those of general import, that are amenable to change. This application represents the beginning step toward developing a cancer control and prevention research program targeted to the LGBT community that has as its starting point a focus on tobacco control and prevention.

"Smokers' Quitline for Asian Language Speakers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study is motivated by the serious public health problems caused by smoking and by the paucity of evidence-based cessation service for smokers of ethnic minority backgrounds. The study tests the effects of telephone counseling for smokers from three Asian language-speaking groups: Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese. Asian Americans are among the least studied groups in smoking research, which has created a knowledge gap in understanding their behavior and in developing methods to help them quit. No efficacy data have been reported for telephone counseling of smokers who prefer to use Asian languages, although telephone intervention holds promise for these groups because of its convenience and its potential to reach large number of smokers.  The specific aims are to: (1) test the efficacy of a culturally sensitive counseling protocol for smokers calling the California Smokers' Helpline on its Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese lines, (2) examine whether intervention effects are moderated by acculturation, (3) examine whether intervention effects vary by cognitive and behavioral predictors of cessation success, (4) examine whether family involvement plays a role in quitting success, and (5) assess differences in counseling effect across the three ethnic groups.  In this two-arm design subjects are stratified by language (Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese) and gender and randomized to telephone counseling or self-help materials, which serves as the control. Subjects (N=2,100) will provide baseline information on demographics, smoking behavior, quitting history, and other psychosocial variables. Independent evaluations at 4, 7, and 13 months after intake will determine whether subjects made a quit attempt and how successful they were at remaining abstinent. This rich data set will also be used to analyze whether acculturation, family involvement, and baseline behavioral and cognitive variables modify the intervention effect.  The proposed study is significant in several ways. First, it will provide timely information on a cessation approach for a traditionally under-served population (Asian language speakers). Second, if proven successful, telephone counseling can be widely applied because of the proliferation of quitlines with centralized services in recent years. Third, by targeting Asian language speakers this study addresses the issue of ethnic disparities, which has been identified by many (including the NCI Bypass Budget) as a research priority.

"Smoking Cessation Intervention with Building Trade Union DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Blue-collar workers are nearly twice as likely to be current smokers as white-collar workers, and this gap has been widening over time. Though they make as many quit attempts per year as their white-collar counterparts, blue-collar workers are less likely to succeed. Effective interventions applied in community-based channels that reach blue-collar workers are needed to reduce this growing disparity. Building trade unions are a potentially important, but largely unevaluated, channel for intervening with this population to reduce smoking prevalence.  The proposed study builds upon our recently-completed pilot study in collaboration with 3 building trade union apprenticeship programs aimed at assessing smoking behaviors and determining the feasibility and effect size of a smoking cessation intervention. Pilot study results confirm that this population of workers is at very high risk of smoking (43% prevalence), that building trade unions can be recruited to a smoking cessation trial, and that our planned interventions are feasible and result in positive changes in smoking behavior. The proposed study uses a cluster randomized clinical trial study design to assess: (1) the efficacy of a smoking cessation intervention among unionized apprentices in the building trades; (2) the determinants of smoking cessation; and (3) the adoption (recruitment into the trial) among eligible apprenticeship programs, reach of the intervention among potential participants, elements of successful implementation and best processes of intervention activities delivered; and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. The intervention is based on prominent behavioral theories, empirical evidence from the peer-reviewed literature, and the US Public Health Service's guideline on smoking cessation, and it taps into essential elements of union culture. It will consist of: a toxics and tobacco curriculum module that includes information about disaster-related threats; group-based behavioral counseling; nicotine replacement therapy; do-it-yourself quit-kits; environmental cues for cessation; and written materials and quit groups for co-workers, friends, and family members.  The study is innovative in its approach to intervening through building trade unions. If shown to be effective, this intervention could be readily disseminated to a national network of building trade union apprenticeship programs, which collectively train approximately 183,000 apprentices each year.

"Smoking Cessation Intervention with Building Trade Union DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Blue-collar workers are nearly twice as likely to be current smokers as white-collar workers, and this gap has been widening over time. Though they make as many quit attempts per year as their white-collar counterparts, blue-collar workers are less likely to succeed. Effective interventions applied in community-based channels that reach blue-collar workers are needed to reduce this growing disparity. Building trade unions are a potentially important, but largely unevaluated, channel for intervening with this population to reduce smoking prevalence.  The proposed study builds upon our recently-completed pilot study in collaboration with 3 building trade union apprenticeship programs aimed at assessing smoking behaviors and determining the feasibility and effect size of a smoking cessation intervention. Pilot study results confirm that this population of workers is at very high risk of smoking (43% prevalence), that building trade unions can be recruited to a smoking cessation trial, and that our planned interventions are feasible and result in positive changes in smoking behavior. The proposed study uses a cluster randomized clinical trial study design to assess: (1) the efficacy of a smoking cessation intervention among unionized apprentices in the building trades; (2) the determinants of smoking cessation; and (3) the adoption (recruitment into the trial) among eligible apprenticeship programs, reach of the intervention among potential participants, elements of successful implementation and best processes of intervention activities delivered; and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. The intervention is based on prominent behavioral theories, empirical evidence from the peer-reviewed literature, and the US Public Health Service's guideline on smoking cessation, and it taps into essential elements of union culture. It will consist of: a toxics and tobacco curriculum module that includes information about disaster-related threats; group-based behavioral counseling; nicotine replacement therapy; do-it-yourself quit-kits; environmental cues for cessation; and written materials and quit groups for co-workers, friends, and family members.  The study is innovative in its approach to intervening through building trade unions. If shown to be effective, this intervention could be readily disseminated to a national network of building trade union apprenticeship programs, which collectively train approximately 183,000 apprentices each year.

"Smokers' Quitline for Asian Language Speakers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study is motivated by the serious public health problems caused by smoking and by the paucity of evidence-based cessation service for smokers of ethnic minority backgrounds. The study tests the effects of telephone counseling for smokers from three Asian language-speaking groups: Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese. Asian Americans are among the least studied groups in smoking research, which has created a knowledge gap in understanding their behavior and in developing methods to help them quit. No efficacy data have been reported for telephone counseling of smokers who prefer to use Asian languages, although telephone intervention holds promise for these groups because of its convenience and its potential to reach large number of smokers.  The specific aims are to: (1) test the efficacy of a culturally sensitive counseling protocol for smokers calling the California Smokers' Helpline on its Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese lines, (2) examine whether intervention effects are moderated by acculturation, (3) examine whether intervention effects vary by cognitive and behavioral predictors of cessation success, (4) examine whether family involvement plays a role in quitting success, and (5) assess differences in counseling effect across the three ethnic groups.  In this two-arm design subjects are stratified by language (Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese) and gender and randomized to telephone counseling or self-help materials, which serves as the control. Subjects (N=2,100) will provide baseline information on demographics, smoking behavior, quitting history, and other psychosocial variables. Independent evaluations at 4, 7, and 13 months after intake will determine whether subjects made a quit attempt and how successful they were at remaining abstinent. This rich data set will also be used to analyze whether acculturation, family involvement, and baseline behavioral and cognitive variables modify the intervention effect.  The proposed study is significant in several ways. First, it will provide timely information on a cessation approach for a traditionally under-served population (Asian language speakers). Second, if proven successful, telephone counseling can be widely applied because of the proliferation of quitlines with centralized services in recent years. Third, by targeting Asian language speakers this study addresses the issue of ethnic disparities, which has been identified by many (including the NCI Bypass Budget) as a research priority.

"Strategies to Help Adult ER Patients Quit Smoking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     In urban communities, the prevalence of tobacco use among adults visiting a hospital emergency room (ER) nears 40%, well in excess of the 25% smoking prevalence rate of the general population. Many of these patients lack easy access to primary care, suggesting the ER may be an attractive locus to initiate tobacco cessation efforts. With over 100 million annual visits to U.S. ERs, it may be possible to engage millions of smokers in tobacco cessation efforts. The major purpose of this study is to examine whether a multicomponent intervention delivered in the ER by a Lay Educator to adult smokers interested in quitting is more likely to result in cessation than usual care. A secondary goal is to test whether patients who present to the ER with a tobacco-related illness (as indicated by ICD9 code) are more likely to quit than ER smokers with a non-tobacco-related condition. This will allow us to test the validity of the ""teachable moment"" as an opportune time to engage patients in considering a behavioral change.  The proposed study is a randomized trial of a motivational interview, provision of literature, and post-visit follow-up (Enhanced Care) vs. referral to a cessation clinic (Minimal Care) for ER patients who smoke. Eligibility criteria: age >= 21 years, contemplation or preparation stage of change, not admitted to hospital. All patients will undergo a standardized stage of change assessment, and measurements of nicotine dependence and exhaled carbon monoxide. All will receive a cessation fact sheet and referral card to the smoking cessation clinic; the cards of those in the Enhanced Care group will have a specific appointment date and time. The Enhanced Care group will receive a language-appropriate pamphlet discussing smoking cessation. We will record the ICD9 codes associated with each visit. Major outcome measure: cessation within 3 months of the ER visit, stratified by treatment group. Secondary outcome measure: cessation within 3 months of the ER visit, stratified by whether the visit was smoking-related. If smokers receiving Enhanced Care are more likely to quit, then the ER could be considered a new, effective locus for tobacco control, potentially reaching several million smokers. If patients with a smoking-related diagnosis for the ER visit are more likely to quit than those with nonsmoking-related ICD9, then this supports the construct of the teachable moment.

"Transitions in Smoking Among Adolescent Minority Girls DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Although adolescent smoking has been a major national concern for many years, there is still relatively little known about its etiology among girls, particularly among young minority girls. While historically smoking rates were greater among males, gender differences in smoking are now virtually non-existent. Studies have demonstrated that at the same level of use, females are more likely to become dependent upon tobacco and are more likely to suffer from a variety of cancers than males, including a greater susceptibility to higher fatality forms of lung cancer. Minority women in particular appear to be at increased risk of developing smoking-related diseases. Therefore, although minority girls demonstrate the lowest rates of smoking during adolescence they may in fact be at highest risk for future smoking and for smoking-related problems. The current project would address existing gaps in the literature in a cost-effective manner through secondary analysis of largely minority, inner-city girls who participated in one of two school-based drug and violence prevention trial (N = 1,138 and N = 1,337). The primary goals of the proposed research are to improve our understanding of how smoking develops among urban minority girls and to examine transitional patterns of smoking behaviors among this population from middle school through high school. Secondary aims of the study are to investigate individual characteristics (i.e., household structure, religiosity, SES, pubertal timing) as potential moderators of the relationship between hypothesized risk factors and smoking as well as to examine relationships between smoking trajectories and indicators of health and well-being among this population. Finally, this study will compare and contrast smoking trajectories by racial/ethnic subgroups as well as examine potential cohort effects. The proposed study represents an important next step in the field of smoking etiology since it examines developmental transitions in smoking behaviors among a severely under-represented population (urban, minority adolescent girls) using state-of-the-art data analytic techniques. Findings from the proposed study will not only advance our understanding of smoking behaviors and transitions among minority girls, but will ultimately help develop and refine prevention efforts for this population and thereby decrease existing gender and racial/ethnic health disparities in the consequences of smoking.

"Ethnic Health/Motivating HIV+ Latinos to Quit Smoking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in the treatment of HIV disease have shown dramatic effects on improving immune function in a significant proportion of people infected with HIV in the US. For the first time since the beginning of the HIV epidemic, individuals with HIV are faced with the prospect of living longer, healthier lives. Cigarette smoking is highly prevalent among HIV+ individuals and, in addition to the negative health effects associated with smoking, poses unique health risks to those with HIV. Our research program is designed to improve the health and quality of life of HTV+ individuals and determine the most efficacious approaches to smoking cessation for diverse subpopulations of these patients. Building on results from our study of a brief motivational smoking cessation intervention among HIV+ smokers in Southern New England, the primary goal of this research program is to target the intervention specifically to Latino patients. Latinos make up 13% of the population, yet account for 18.5% of all AIDS cases reported through December 2002, making the Latino AIDS rate 4 times higher than that of non-Hispanic Whites.6 Research is limited in the area of HIV among Latinos and there are no studies to date that address the problem of tobacco use among HIV+ Latinos. We propose to address this disparity by focusing this research study on Latino men and women living with HIV/AIDS. Our goal is to develop and evaluate a clinic based culturally tailored smoking cessation treatment for a largely low-income, Latino, HIV+ population. We will compare this culturally sensitive intervention that incorporates a strong social support component to a standard care control condition, in a randomized controlled trial. We hypothesize that those Latinos receiving the Culturally Tailored Intervention will demonstrate greater biochemically verified smoking abstinence rates at 12- months post-baseline than those receiving a Standard Care Intervention control treatment. Hypotheses will be tested regarding the main effect of acculturation on smoking quit rates in the two treatment conditions. Critical information regarding how the intervention reaches patients and with whom it is most effective will be uncovered by examining mediators and moderators of the intervention-smoking cessation relationship. This study will be the first to examine different smoking cessation treatments in a Latino HIV+ population and the results will have implications for importing culturally sensitive and cost effective cessation treatments into clinical care settings.

"Sex, GABA and Nicotine: A 1H-MRS Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While there are several note-worthy differences between males and females with regard to smoking behavior, ultimately none are as worrisome as the disparity in ability to quit smoking. Although multiple explanations for why women are less successful in their abstinence attempts have been proffered, the observation that women are more likely to experience emergence of depressive symptoms during smoking cessation, a known risk factor for relapse, may be a critical contributor to this sex-specific recidivism. Several lines of evidence suggest that nicotine modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) may play an important role in this interplay between sex, depression and smoking recidivism. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), our group has found reductions in occipital cortex GABA concentrations in subjects with unipolar depression and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Recently, we have published pilot data from healthy smoking men and women indicating that nicotine induced alterations in cortical GABA levels are found solely in women and are characterized by reduced GABA levels in the follicular phase and abolished menstrual cyclicity in GABA levels. Reductions in cortical GABA levels in women who smoke may therefore render them at increased risk for depression, which sabotages their attempts to quit. Thus, we propose to employ 1H-MRS to measure GABA levels in the occipital cortex of a larger group of healthy smoking and nonsmoking women and men to confirm the impact of sex as well as menstrual cycle phase on nicotine-induced alterations in cortical GABA concentrations. In addition, women will be invited to undergo 10-14 days of abstinence using contingency management so that we may examine the relationship between baseline GABA and changes in GABA with abstinence and emergence of negative affect and craving. This project is both novel and timely as it responds directly to the mandate from NIDA to examine the impact of sex-specific factors on substance abuse/dependence disorders in order to enhance long-term abstinence. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: The study outlined in this proposal will not only further our knowledge regarding the influence of nicotine on brain chemistry, it may also lead to new medications to enhance smoking cessation in females and/or others at risk for depression during smoking abstinence.         ","Sex, GABA and Nicotine: A 1H-MRS Study",7037179,R01DA018359,"['gamma aminobutyrate ', ' occipital lobe /cortex ', ' relapse /recurrence ', ' menstrual cycle ', ' human subject ', ' magnetic resonance imaging ', ' behavior modification ', ' emotion ', ' psychopharmacology ', ' nicotine ', ' GABA receptor ', ' gender difference ', ' smoking ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' neuroregulation ', ' craving ', ' substance abuse related behavior ', ' drug /alcohol abstinence ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,287004,0.1392259256647242

"Strategies to Help Adult ER Patients Quit Smoking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     In urban communities, the prevalence of tobacco use among adults visiting a hospital emergency room (ER) nears 40%, well in excess of the 25% smoking prevalence rate of the general population. Many of these patients lack easy access to primary care, suggesting the ER may be an attractive locus to initiate tobacco cessation efforts. With over 100 million annual visits to U.S. ERs, it may be possible to engage millions of smokers in tobacco cessation efforts. The major purpose of this study is to examine whether a multicomponent intervention delivered in the ER by a Lay Educator to adult smokers interested in quitting is more likely to result in cessation than usual care. A secondary goal is to test whether patients who present to the ER with a tobacco-related illness (as indicated by ICD9 code) are more likely to quit than ER smokers with a non-tobacco-related condition. This will allow us to test the validity of the ""teachable moment"" as an opportune time to engage patients in considering a behavioral change.  The proposed study is a randomized trial of a motivational interview, provision of literature, and post-visit follow-up (Enhanced Care) vs. referral to a cessation clinic (Minimal Care) for ER patients who smoke. Eligibility criteria: age >= 21 years, contemplation or preparation stage of change, not admitted to hospital. All patients will undergo a standardized stage of change assessment, and measurements of nicotine dependence and exhaled carbon monoxide. All will receive a cessation fact sheet and referral card to the smoking cessation clinic; the cards of those in the Enhanced Care group will have a specific appointment date and time. The Enhanced Care group will receive a language-appropriate pamphlet discussing smoking cessation. We will record the ICD9 codes associated with each visit. Major outcome measure: cessation within 3 months of the ER visit, stratified by treatment group. Secondary outcome measure: cessation within 3 months of the ER visit, stratified by whether the visit was smoking-related. If smokers receiving Enhanced Care are more likely to quit, then the ER could be considered a new, effective locus for tobacco control, potentially reaching several million smokers. If patients with a smoking-related diagnosis for the ER visit are more likely to quit than those with nonsmoking-related ICD9, then this supports the construct of the teachable moment.

"Ethnic Health/Motivating HIV+ Latinos to Quit Smoking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in the treatment of HIV disease have shown dramatic effects on improving immune function in a significant proportion of people infected with HIV in the US. For the first time since the beginning of the HIV epidemic, individuals with HIV are faced with the prospect of living longer, healthier lives. Cigarette smoking is highly prevalent among HIV+ individuals and, in addition to the negative health effects associated with smoking, poses unique health risks to those with HIV. Our research program is designed to improve the health and quality of life of HTV+ individuals and determine the most efficacious approaches to smoking cessation for diverse subpopulations of these patients. Building on results from our study of a brief motivational smoking cessation intervention among HIV+ smokers in Southern New England, the primary goal of this research program is to target the intervention specifically to Latino patients. Latinos make up 13% of the population, yet account for 18.5% of all AIDS cases reported through December 2002, making the Latino AIDS rate 4 times higher than that of non-Hispanic Whites.6 Research is limited in the area of HIV among Latinos and there are no studies to date that address the problem of tobacco use among HIV+ Latinos. We propose to address this disparity by focusing this research study on Latino men and women living with HIV/AIDS. Our goal is to develop and evaluate a clinic based culturally tailored smoking cessation treatment for a largely low-income, Latino, HIV+ population. We will compare this culturally sensitive intervention that incorporates a strong social support component to a standard care control condition, in a randomized controlled trial. We hypothesize that those Latinos receiving the Culturally Tailored Intervention will demonstrate greater biochemically verified smoking abstinence rates at 12- months post-baseline than those receiving a Standard Care Intervention control treatment. Hypotheses will be tested regarding the main effect of acculturation on smoking quit rates in the two treatment conditions. Critical information regarding how the intervention reaches patients and with whom it is most effective will be uncovered by examining mediators and moderators of the intervention-smoking cessation relationship. This study will be the first to examine different smoking cessation treatments in a Latino HIV+ population and the results will have implications for importing culturally sensitive and cost effective cessation treatments into clinical care settings.

"Group-based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy among African Smokers: An Efficacy Test    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of preventable death and disease in the United States. Tobacco use claims the lives of over 176,000 Americans due to cancer each year. Compared to Caucasians, African American smokers suffer disproportionately from smoking-related illnesses. Few studies have tested the efficacy of smoking cessation treatments with representative samples of African Americans. A recent meta- analysis suggested that group counseling is among the most efficacious treatments for this population; yet, this conclusion was based on only two studies. The current application will test of the feasibility and efficacy of an established cognitive-behavioral smoking intervention among African American adults. Identifying whether this treatment is also beneficial for African Americans has theoretical and applied implications that transcend this project. The specific aims of the study will be (1) to examine the feasibility of conducting an intensive group cognitive behavioral intervention plus nicotine replacement in a sample of African American smokers, (2) to test the efficacy of the intervention, and (3) to begin exploratory analyses of predictors of successful smoking cessation (nicotine dependence, smoking outcome expectancies, health locus of control, cessation self-efficacy, and treatment utilization). To accomplish this, 80 smokers will be randomized to receive either a two-week group cognitive behavioral smoking intervention plus nicotine patch therapy (NPT), or a two-week health education intervention plus nicotine patch therapy. The group treatment will be based on an efficacious cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) that includes education on tobacco addiction, the time-course of nicotine withdrawal, positive reinforcement, self-monitoring, identification of high-risk situations, coping skills training, and contingency contracting. The health education intervention (HE), a time and attention matched control condition, will present didactic information on a variety of health topics other than smoking cessation. Our primary outcomes will be point-prevalence abstinence, both 24-hour and 7- day, and 28-day continuous abstinence. Participants will be assessed post treatment (two weeks), and at three and six months post treatment. Thus, we will use a 2 (intervention) x 3 (time) design. It is hypothesized that the CBT plus NPT condition will demonstrate greater smoking cessation at each assessment compared to the HE plus NPT condition. It is also expected that baseline nicotine dependence, positive smoking outcome expectancies, and external health locus of control will be negatively associated with smoking cessation success. Intervention utilization will be positively associated with smoking cessation. The long term objective of this work is to advance the field by informing the development of smoking cessation treatments for African American smokers. This has important public health implications related to reducing smoking-related health disparities.           ",Group-based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy among African Smokers: An Efficacy Test,7226847,R03CA126418,"['health ', ' conditioning ', ' nicotine ', ' smoking cessation ', ' smoking ', ' clinical research ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' ']",NCI,SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY,R03,2006,73750,0.32792994334491615
"Smoking Cessation Intervention with Building Trade Union DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Blue-collar workers are nearly twice as likely to be current smokers as white-collar workers, and this gap has been widening over time. Though they make as many quit attempts per year as their white-collar counterparts, blue-collar workers are less likely to succeed. Effective interventions applied in community-based channels that reach blue-collar workers are needed to reduce this growing disparity. Building trade unions are a potentially important, but largely unevaluated, channel for intervening with this population to reduce smoking prevalence.  The proposed study builds upon our recently-completed pilot study in collaboration with 3 building trade union apprenticeship programs aimed at assessing smoking behaviors and determining the feasibility and effect size of a smoking cessation intervention. Pilot study results confirm that this population of workers is at very high risk of smoking (43% prevalence), that building trade unions can be recruited to a smoking cessation trial, and that our planned interventions are feasible and result in positive changes in smoking behavior. The proposed study uses a cluster randomized clinical trial study design to assess: (1) the efficacy of a smoking cessation intervention among unionized apprentices in the building trades; (2) the determinants of smoking cessation; and (3) the adoption (recruitment into the trial) among eligible apprenticeship programs, reach of the intervention among potential participants, elements of successful implementation and best processes of intervention activities delivered; and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. The intervention is based on prominent behavioral theories, empirical evidence from the peer-reviewed literature, and the US Public Health Service's guideline on smoking cessation, and it taps into essential elements of union culture. It will consist of: a toxics and tobacco curriculum module that includes information about disaster-related threats; group-based behavioral counseling; nicotine replacement therapy; do-it-yourself quit-kits; environmental cues for cessation; and written materials and quit groups for co-workers, friends, and family members.  The study is innovative in its approach to intervening through building trade unions. If shown to be effective, this intervention could be readily disseminated to a national network of building trade union apprenticeship programs, which collectively train approximately 183,000 apprentices each year.

"Internet Based Voucher Reinforcement for Smoking Cessation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Internet-Based Voucher Reinforcement for Smoking Cessation: Tobacco use continues to be the number one preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. In no other population are the prevalence rates and problems of smoking more apparent and pronounced than those in rural populations, where access to treatment is limited. Current smoking cessation interventions are modestly effective, which suggest the need for therapies that are more intensive, innovative, and accessible. Voucher-based abstinence reinforcement therapy is a highly intensive approach wherein patients earn monetary vouchers that can be exchanged for goods and services contingent on documented abstinence. To improve the accessibility of this intensive therapy to smokers who want to quit smoking, a novel voucher based abstinence reinforcement therapy for smoking has been developed wherein smoking status is frequently monitored and reinforced via the internet. With this internet based intervention, real-time video of smokers providing CO samples are collected and verified for smoking status. Patients are then provided feedback and reinforcement based on their verified smoking status. This innovative approach may be well suited for rural smokers who are in need of accessible intensive smoking cessation interventions. This grant application proposes exploratory research to adapt, implement, and evaluate a novel internet based voucher reinforcement intervention for smoking cessation in heavy smokers in rural Kentucky. A pilot study is proposed in which rural smokers in Kentucky (N=80) will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: contingent vs. noncontingent vouchers group. For 6 weeks, CO samples will be collected and verified twice daily from all participants using an internet based CO monitoring system. Participants assigned to the contingent vouchers group will receive monetary vouchers if they provide a CO sample <4ppm. Participants in the noncontingent vouchers group will receive vouchers independent of their CO sample. Overall, the application proposes research to develop and evaluate an intensive and accessible smoking cessation intervention for heavy smokers in rural communites, and provide the empirical basis for future research.           ",Internet Based Voucher Reinforcement for Smoking Cessation,7184155,R21CA124881,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Elements ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Smoking Status ', ' Monitor ', ' Rate ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Medical ', ' Kentucky ', ' Numbers ', ' Rural ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Daily ', ' Smoker ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement (Psychology) ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Rural Population ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachia ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Week ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Services ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Rural Community ', ' Sampling ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' voucher ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R21,2007,177980,0.3096137419081925
"Smokers' Quitline for Asian Language Speakers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study is motivated by the serious public health problems caused by smoking and by the paucity of evidence-based cessation service for smokers of ethnic minority backgrounds. The study tests the effects of telephone counseling for smokers from three Asian language-speaking groups: Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese. Asian Americans are among the least studied groups in smoking research, which has created a knowledge gap in understanding their behavior and in developing methods to help them quit. No efficacy data have been reported for telephone counseling of smokers who prefer to use Asian languages, although telephone intervention holds promise for these groups because of its convenience and its potential to reach large number of smokers.  The specific aims are to: (1) test the efficacy of a culturally sensitive counseling protocol for smokers calling the California Smokers' Helpline on its Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese lines, (2) examine whether intervention effects are moderated by acculturation, (3) examine whether intervention effects vary by cognitive and behavioral predictors of cessation success, (4) examine whether family involvement plays a role in quitting success, and (5) assess differences in counseling effect across the three ethnic groups.  In this two-arm design subjects are stratified by language (Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese) and gender and randomized to telephone counseling or self-help materials, which serves as the control. Subjects (N=2,100) will provide baseline information on demographics, smoking behavior, quitting history, and other psychosocial variables. Independent evaluations at 4, 7, and 13 months after intake will determine whether subjects made a quit attempt and how successful they were at remaining abstinent. This rich data set will also be used to analyze whether acculturation, family involvement, and baseline behavioral and cognitive variables modify the intervention effect.  The proposed study is significant in several ways. First, it will provide timely information on a cessation approach for a traditionally under-served population (Asian language speakers). Second, if proven successful, telephone counseling can be widely applied because of the proliferation of quitlines with centralized services in recent years. Third, by targeting Asian language speakers this study addresses the issue of ethnic disparities, which has been identified by many (including the NCI Bypass Budget) as a research priority.

"Vocational Student Tobacco Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the prevalence of tobacco use decreased for most segments of the US population between 1993 and 2000, disparities persist. Young adults and individuals in the lowest socioeconomic status (SES) categories report the highest rates of tobacco use. Low SES increases exposure to multiple types of stress and stress is positively associated with tobacco use. Unfortunately, studies examining the putative mechanisms, or mediators, of the stress-tobacco use relationship for low SES young adults are scare. Also lacking from the literature is an understanding of the roles of race/ethnicity and cultural factors as moderators of the relationships among cumulative stress, depressive symptoms, and tobacco use. This application aims to: 1) determine whether depressive symptoms mediate the relationship between an accumulation of life events stress, discrimination stress, financial stress, role overload and tobacco use in low SES young adults and b) Explore the cultural factors that may moderate the cumulative stress and depressive symptoms effects. Quantitative (survey) and qualitative (focus group interviews) methodologies will be used to address these aims. Approximately 900 ethnically diverse young adult students enrolled in two 2-year post-secondary vocational programs will be asked to complete an anonymous survey examining varying types of stress, depressive symptoms, and tobacco use. A subset of these students will be asked to participate in focus group interviews aimed at understanding the cultural factors involved in tobacco use. The Specific Aims of the project will be to: 1) determine if levels of stress and depressive symptoms vary across tobacco use 2) examine the relationships among cumulative stress, depressive symptoms, tobacco use, and race/ethnicity, after accounting for gender and income and 3) explore cultural differences in young adult perceptions of why they use tobacco and the roles of stress and depressive symptoms in their tobacco use. This proposed project is consistent with the Healthy People 2010 Goal #2 of reducing health disparities and the objective of reducing cigarette smoking by adults. Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Each year more than 440,000 adults die from tobacco-related diseases and smoking, the most common form of tobacco use, is causally linked to the development of numerous cancers including, but not limited to, lung, bladder, kidney, cervical, and esophageal. Young adults and individuals in the lowest socioeconomic status categories report the highest rates of tobacco use and the lowest rates of cessation. Development of effective prevention and intervention programs aimed at reducing tobacco use in this population require an understanding of the factors that contribute to their tobacco use.          ",Vocational Student Tobacco Use,7334520,R03CA130589,"['United States ', ' day ', ' Event ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Bladder ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' American ', ' intervention program ', ' Buffers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Categories ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Reporting ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Accounting ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' cost ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Rate ', ' Esophageal ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Horns ', ' Cervical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Distress ', ' dysphoria ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Literature ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Perception ', ' Exposure to ', ' Productivity ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Appendix ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Societies ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Texas ', ' Tobacco ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2007,71446,0.07120498734213546
"Sex, GABA and Nicotine: A 1H-MRS Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While there are several note-worthy differences between males and females with regard to smoking behavior, ultimately none are as worrisome as the disparity in ability to quit smoking. Although multiple explanations for why women are less successful in their abstinence attempts have been proffered, the observation that women are more likely to experience emergence of depressive symptoms during smoking cessation, a known risk factor for relapse, may be a critical contributor to this sex-specific recidivism. Several lines of evidence suggest that nicotine modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) may play an important role in this interplay between sex, depression and smoking recidivism. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), our group has found reductions in occipital cortex GABA concentrations in subjects with unipolar depression and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Recently, we have published pilot data from healthy smoking men and women indicating that nicotine induced alterations in cortical GABA levels are found solely in women and are characterized by reduced GABA levels in the follicular phase and abolished menstrual cyclicity in GABA levels. Reductions in cortical GABA levels in women who smoke may therefore render them at increased risk for depression, which sabotages their attempts to quit. Thus, we propose to employ 1H-MRS to measure GABA levels in the occipital cortex of a larger group of healthy smoking and nonsmoking women and men to confirm the impact of sex as well as menstrual cycle phase on nicotine-induced alterations in cortical GABA concentrations. In addition, women will be invited to undergo 10-14 days of abstinence using contingency management so that we may examine the relationship between baseline GABA and changes in GABA with abstinence and emergence of negative affect and craving. This project is both novel and timely as it responds directly to the mandate from NIDA to examine the impact of sex-specific factors on substance abuse/dependence disorders in order to enhance long-term abstinence. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: The study outlined in this proposal will not only further our knowledge regarding the influence of nicotine on brain chemistry, it may also lead to new medications to enhance smoking cessation in females and/or others at risk for depression during smoking abstinence.         ","Sex, GABA and Nicotine: A 1H-MRS Study",7213450,R01DA018359,"['Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Epilepsy ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Transdisciplinary Tobacco Research Center ', ' Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Center ', ' TTURC ', ' TTRC ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' Female ', ' proliferative phase Menstrual cycle ', ' Preovulatory Phase ', ' Menstrual Proliferative Phase ', ' Follicular Phase Menstrual Cycle ', ' Follicular Phase ', ' Future ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' GABA ', ' Aminalone ', ' Aminalon ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' Affect ', ' Glutamates ', ' glutamatergic ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' Glutamine ', ' Q.

"Randomized Trial of Lay Health Worker Smoking Cessation Intervention for Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Latinos and smoking is responsible for almost 90% of these deaths. Cultural factors unique to Latinos may act to either increase (e.g., family) or decrease (e.g., machismo) success of smoking cessation. In a community needs assessment, LACRC community clinic partners indicated that tobacco cessation services were a high priority. In our prior work in the LACRC, we also found that smokers were interested in cessation and would agree to participate in smoking studies. Of note, this work also demonstrated that depression and alcohol use were associated with smoking behavior. Research by others has shown that telephone counseling is effective and cost-effective in non-Latino groups and our partners have indicated that this approach was feasible in their clinics. In this pilot, we use the Social Networks Model to evaluate a randomized clinical trial (n=175) of a 6-session (and one 3 month booster), culturally-tailored telephone counseling intervention delivered by a lay health worker (LHW) compared to usual care (referral to a non-tailored Spanish tobacco quit line). We will also provide screening and referral for depression and alcohol use and inform participants about pharmaceutical support for nicotine withdrawal. Our overarching goal is to assess the impact of cultural tailoring and delivery by a peer from the participant's social network compared to use of simple language translation of existing materials. The associated aims are to: 1) test the hypothesis that the intervention group will have higher rates of quit attempts and abstinence than the control group at 6 weeks and 3 months, 2) explore whether cultural beliefs moderate the effects of the intervention, and 3) explore whether co-morbid alcohol use and depression mediate the effects of the intervention. If effective, the trained LHWs will be able to continue the counseling program at the clinics. The results will also be used to extend this trial and develop additional tobacco cessation research. Dr. Spernak, the project leader, will also be able to use this pilot to gain mentoring in tobacco control and grounding in Latino culture so that she can become an independent researcher in cancer disparities.           ",Randomized Trial of Lay Health Worker Smoking Cessation Intervention for Latinos,7336523,U01CA114593,"['Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' quitline ', ' quit line ', ' tobacco control ', ' cost ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Abstinence ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' network models ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Indigenous ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cessation Research ', ' Other Minority ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Rate ', ' Family ', ' Advertising ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Area ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Link ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Language ', ' Numbers ', ' Trust ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Nicotine Withdrawal ', ' Immigrant ', ' Smoker ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' programs ', ' Stomach ', ' gastric ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' South American ', ' Work ', ' day ', ' Week ', ' Clinic ', ' Belief ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' success ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Breast ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Carbon Monoxide ', ' ']",NCI,MEDSTAR HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2007,75008,0.16174046650048157
"Literacy and Smoking Risk Communications    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For over 90 million adults - nearly half of all adults in the United States - difficulty with health literacy interferes with the capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information. Moreover, these individuals have an increased risk of disease. Because tobacco smoking is the leading behavioral risk factor that contributes to social disparities in the incidence and mortality of disease, effectively providing low-literate smokers with information concerning the health consequences of smoking is critical. Therefore, the primary aim of the proposed study is to examine how health literacy influences responses to smoking risk messages manipulated in terms of message framing and emotionality. In addition to traditional questionnaires, outcomes will be assessed using ""implicit"" cognitive psychological measures. Thus, the proposed study examines the immediate effects of different types of smoking risk messages on cognition in a laboratory setting. Findings will have important implications for the future development of smoking cessation interventions targeted at low literacy populations. Smokers with varying levels of health literacy (i.e., inadequate, marginal, adequate) will listen to one of four different types of smoking risk messages recorded on a computer in the form of audio scripts (i.e., a human voice pre-recorded on a computer will read each message) and concurrently presented in written form via a computer monitor. They will be written at a fifth- to sixth-grade reading level and manipulated in terms of 1) framing (i.e., gain-framed messages that highlight the benefits of quitting vs. loss-framed messages that emphasize the costs of failing to quit), and 2) emotionality (i.e., primarily fact-based vs. primarily emotion-based). Framing and emotionality will be completely crossed to create four different types of messages, 1) factual gain-framed, 2) factual loss-framed, 3) emotional gain-framed, and 4) emotional loss-framed. The primary specific aims are to examine: 1) whether main effects emerge for health literacy (inadequate, marginal, adequate) and the different message types (fact-based vs. emotion-based and gain-framed vs. loss-framed) on the primary explicit and implicit outcome measures: a) intention to quit smoking, and b) implicit and explicit attitudes toward smoking, and 2) whether health literacy interacts with the different message types (fact- vs. emotion-based and gain- vs. loss- framed) to influence the primary explicit and implicit outcome measures: a) intention to quit smoking, and b) implicit and explicit attitudes toward smoking. A secondary, exploratory aim is to examine potential associations between explicit and implicit outcomes. Findings will shed light on important cognitive mechanisms that may influence the potency of smoking risk messages across the health literacy spectrum. Moreover, findings will be directly relevant to translation of the basic behavioral science underlying smoking risk communications into enhanced smoking cessation treatment approaches.           ",Literacy and Smoking Risk Communications,7189786,R01CA125413,"['Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Emotions ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Reader ', ' Cognitive ', ' Low Literacy Population ', ' Smoking and Health Research ', ' Smoking and Health ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Intention ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Glass ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Housing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Health Campaign ', ' Incidence ', ' Computer information processing ', ' Evaluation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Visual ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' literacy ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Descriptor ', ' Nurses ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Smoker ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Reading ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Attitude ', ' Voice ', ' Writing ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' interest ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' treatment program ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' literate ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Prevention ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' response ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Basic Behavioral Science ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' computer monitor ', ' Computers ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2007,292600,0.08020283836338779
"The Impact of a Tobacco Control Intervention in African-American Families    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly 25 million US adults and 6.4 million children living today will die prematurely from tobacco-attributable diseases unless adults are successful with cessation and rates of child tobacco use are halted. Fifteen million US children <18 years old are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) mostly in their homes and parent modeling of smoking is identified as an important factor for the 4,000 children who initiate tobacco use each day. With widening gaps in health disparities for African Americans (AAs) related to the health effects of tobacco use, culturally sensitive approaches that may be effective need to be fully tested. Based on concepts from Social Cognitive Theory and taking a social ecological perspective, this research will investigate the effects of a family approach that includes child and parent/guardian (PIG) interventions on tobacco control. Subjects will include 4th grade AA children (N=400) and Ps/Gs; 50% rural and 50% inner-city. Using a two group design with repeated measures, schools (20) will be randomly assigned to treatment or control. Children and Ps/Gs in the treatment group will receive a yearly intervention for two years and the control group will receive matched contact and attention on general health education. The child intervention (Botvin's LifeSkills (BLS) consist of 8 classroom sessions taught during 4th and 5th grades (16 total sessions) by trained school personnel. The PIG intervention (BLS Parent) consists of 8 home-based modules during the 4th and 5th grades that promote PIG use of anti- tobacco socialization in the home and reinforce the school-based child intervention. Ps/Gs who smoke will also receive motivational interviewing and nicotine replacement therapy based on their readiness to quit. Behavioral change will be measured by self-report in children and Ps/Gs at baseline, 12 weeks (short-term) and 9 months (long-term) after each year of intervention (2) and also via salivary cotinine at three time points (baseline, at year 2 and at year 4). We propose this family approach will foster development of personal and environmental protective factors in children and their Ps/Gs for tobacco control. The primary hypotheses are: Children and Ps/ Gs in the treatment group will have improved behavioral outcomes of: 1) lower ETS exposure in children; 2) lower rates of tobacco experimentation in children; 3) higher PIG self-efficacy in delivering anti-tobacco socialization in the home; and 4) higher tobacco cessation rates in Ps/Gs. This research addresses a significant public health concern, tobacco use, which remains the single most preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. Consistent with both the NCI and the NICHD, this application targets the advancement of socio-cultural behavioral treatments for children and their families, the prevention of tobacco-related diseases, particularly cancer, and the elimination of health disparities among an ethnic minority group-AA. The need for theory-based effective interventions validated by biochemical measures is imperative for tobacco control. If effective, implementation of this family approach via the school systems as the primary point of entry is highly probable.           ",The Impact of a Tobacco Control Intervention in African-American Families,7320233,R01CA118066,"['Cotinine ', ' Scotine ', ' 2-Pyrrolidinone, 1-methyl-5-(3-pyridinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Sus scrofa ', ' Wild Boar ', ' Porcine Species ', ' Pigs Mammals ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' End Point ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Indigenous ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Study Section ', ' Smoking Status ', ' Rate ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Killings ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' USA Georgia ', ' Western Asia Georgia ', ' Georgian SSR ', ' Georgian S.S.R.

"The Effects of Neighborhood Characteristics on Smoking Cessation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco-related lung cancer is a leading cause of death among adults, and tobacco use accounts for -30% of cancer incidence and mortality. Therefore, eliminating tobacco uptake, increasing rates of tobacco cessation, and preventing smoking relapse are the cornerstones of cancer prevention. Moreover, a focus on groups disproportionately affected by tobacco use (e.g., minorities, low socioeconomic status (SES) groups, or populations at increased risk of relapse) is of clear importance in the fight against cancer. Previous research has shown that neighborhood-level SES is independently associated with higher smoking prevalence, but the role of the neighborhood in smoking outcome during a specific quit attempt has not been studied. The primary aim of this research is to examine how neighborhood characteristics influence the mechanisms underlying the process of smoking cessation and relapse prevention during a specific quit attempt among diverse community samples at increased risk for health disparities in cancer. Archival data will be examined from 4 study populations: Spanish speaking Hispanic smokers (n = 297), African-American smokers (n = 400), African-American, English speaking Hispanic, and Caucasian smokers in equal numbers (n = 420), and pregnant women who quit smoking and want to remain quit postpartum (n = 450). Specific aims of this project are to: i) Evaluate the relation between neighborhood characteristics (including neighborhood-level SES, racial/ethnic composition, neighborhood problems, vigilance, social cohesion, and social control) and smoking abstinence; 2) Evaluate the relation of stress, depression, negative affect, self-efficacy, and social support with neighborhood characteristics and with smoking abstinence, respectively; and 3) Evaluate whether self-efficacy, depression, negative affect, stress, and/or social support mediate an observed association between neighborhood characteristics and abstinence. In a series of 4 studies, I will use multilevel modeling to examine the pathways through which the neighborhood context influences cessation using both questionnaire and ecological momentary assessment data, as well as sophisticated geographical software to map neighborhood-level demographic and economic data. These efforts will result in a better understanding of disparities in smoking status among underserved populations and provide information important for improving service to individuals from those communities, thereby affecting public health.          ",The Effects of Neighborhood Characteristics on Smoking Cessation,7395190,K01DP001120,[''],NCCDPHP,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K01,2007,150000,0.16738885007835763
"Group-based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy among African Smokers: An Efficacy Test    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of preventable death and disease in the United States. Tobacco use claims the lives of over 176,000 Americans due to cancer each year. Compared to Caucasians, African American smokers suffer disproportionately from smoking-related illnesses. Few studies have tested the efficacy of smoking cessation treatments with representative samples of African Americans. A recent meta- analysis suggested that group counseling is among the most efficacious treatments for this population; yet, this conclusion was based on only two studies. The current application will test of the feasibility and efficacy of an established cognitive-behavioral smoking intervention among African American adults. Identifying whether this treatment is also beneficial for African Americans has theoretical and applied implications that transcend this project. The specific aims of the study will be (1) to examine the feasibility of conducting an intensive group cognitive behavioral intervention plus nicotine replacement in a sample of African American smokers, (2) to test the efficacy of the intervention, and (3) to begin exploratory analyses of predictors of successful smoking cessation (nicotine dependence, smoking outcome expectancies, health locus of control, cessation self-efficacy, and treatment utilization). To accomplish this, 80 smokers will be randomized to receive either a two-week group cognitive behavioral smoking intervention plus nicotine patch therapy (NPT), or a two-week health education intervention plus nicotine patch therapy. The group treatment will be based on an efficacious cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) that includes education on tobacco addiction, the time-course of nicotine withdrawal, positive reinforcement, self-monitoring, identification of high-risk situations, coping skills training, and contingency contracting. The health education intervention (HE), a time and attention matched control condition, will present didactic information on a variety of health topics other than smoking cessation. Our primary outcomes will be point-prevalence abstinence, both 24-hour and 7- day, and 28-day continuous abstinence. Participants will be assessed post treatment (two weeks), and at three and six months post treatment. Thus, we will use a 2 (intervention) x 3 (time) design. It is hypothesized that the CBT plus NPT condition will demonstrate greater smoking cessation at each assessment compared to the HE plus NPT condition. It is also expected that baseline nicotine dependence, positive smoking outcome expectancies, and external health locus of control will be negatively associated with smoking cessation success. Intervention utilization will be positively associated with smoking cessation. The long term objective of this work is to advance the field by informing the development of smoking cessation treatments for African American smokers.

"Virtual  Smoking Cessation groups for American Indian via telemedicine    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) have the highest smoking rates any ethnic group in the United States, at 41% versus 24% for African Americans and Whites. They also have the lowest quit rates of any group, at 8-10% at 6 months. Due to its long cultural significance as a sacred plant, the entirely negative portrayal of tobacco in most smoking cessation programs is inappropriate, leaving programs unsuccessful. In 2003, AI/AN patients from Haskell Health Center requested a culturally-appropriate smoking cessation program, causing the center director to contact the University of Kansas Medical Center Department of Preventive Medicine. Since that time, the larger AI/AN community in Kansas and Missouri has been working collaboratively with KUMC on the development of a culturally-tailored smoking cessation program, as well as several other projects. In 2006, KUMC and several community-based organizations formed the American Indian Health Research and Education Alliance, dedicated to improving the health of AI/AN using community-based participatory research methods. The culturally-tailored smoking cessation program that began the partnership, All Nations Breath of Life (ANBL), has now been developed and pilot tested and is ready for implementation in the urban AI/AN community of the Kansas City Metroplex. Our pilot data are promising; with a 25% quit rate and 80% participant retention at 6-months post-baseline. We will address the following specific aims: (1) To create appropriate infrastructure (personnel, space, supplies, leadership commitment) for the Heart of America Indian Center to serve as the primary site for implementation of ANBL; (2) To examine the acceptability and feasibility of implementing ANBL in an urban AI/AN community; (3) To estimate the effectiveness of ANBL in an urban AI/AN community; and (4) to identify factors that enhance dissemination of ANBL and contribute to program success or failure. We hypothesize that participants in ANBL will quit smoking at a higher rate than currently reported in the literature for the best available programs. In addition, we will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the program to help determine its sustainability. If this project is successful, ANBL can be disseminated to other AI/AN communities to help them quit smoking. By reducing smoking rates in this community, we can ultimately reduce their leading cause of cancer death (lung cancer) and their leading cause of overall death, cardiovascular disease.           ",Virtual  Smoking Cessation groups for American Indian via telemedicine,7670798,R24MD002773,"['Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' All Sites ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adoption ', ' enhancing factor ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Kansas ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Leadership ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Living Wills ', ' living will ', ' Logic ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Maintenance ', ' Americas ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Missouri ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Native Americans ', ' Patients ', ' Plants ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Smoker ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Medical center ', ' success ', ' intervention program ', ' Participant ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Native Alaskan ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' County ', ' Native-Born ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' tobacco control ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' community living ', ' urban native american ', ' urban American Indian ', ' Outcome ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R24,2008,450000,0.2297871537968166
"Vocational Student Tobacco Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the prevalence of tobacco use decreased for most segments of the US population between 1993 and 2000, disparities persist. Young adults and individuals in the lowest socioeconomic status (SES) categories report the highest rates of tobacco use. Low SES increases exposure to multiple types of stress and stress is positively associated with tobacco use. Unfortunately, studies examining the putative mechanisms, or mediators, of the stress-tobacco use relationship for low SES young adults are scare. Also lacking from the literature is an understanding of the roles of race/ethnicity and cultural factors as moderators of the relationships among cumulative stress, depressive symptoms, and tobacco use. This application aims to: 1) determine whether depressive symptoms mediate the relationship between an accumulation of life events stress, discrimination stress, financial stress, role overload and tobacco use in low SES young adults and b) Explore the cultural factors that may moderate the cumulative stress and depressive symptoms effects. Quantitative (survey) and qualitative (focus group interviews) methodologies will be used to address these aims. Approximately 900 ethnically diverse young adult students enrolled in two 2-year post-secondary vocational programs will be asked to complete an anonymous survey examining varying types of stress, depressive symptoms, and tobacco use. A subset of these students will be asked to participate in focus group interviews aimed at understanding the cultural factors involved in tobacco use. The Specific Aims of the project will be to: 1) determine if levels of stress and depressive symptoms vary across tobacco use 2) examine the relationships among cumulative stress, depressive symptoms, tobacco use, and race/ethnicity, after accounting for gender and income and 3) explore cultural differences in young adult perceptions of why they use tobacco and the roles of stress and depressive symptoms in their tobacco use. This proposed project is consistent with the Healthy People 2010 Goal #2 of reducing health disparities and the objective of reducing cigarette smoking by adults. Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Each year more than 440,000 adults die from tobacco-related diseases and smoking, the most common form of tobacco use, is causally linked to the development of numerous cancers including, but not limited to, lung, bladder, kidney, cervical, and esophageal. Young adults and individuals in the lowest socioeconomic status categories report the highest rates of tobacco use and the lowest rates of cessation. Development of effective prevention and intervention programs aimed at reducing tobacco use in this population require an understanding of the factors that contribute to their tobacco use.          ",Vocational Student Tobacco Use,7452468,R03CA130589,"['Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Rate ', ' Esophageal ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Horns ', ' Cervical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Distress ', ' dysphoria ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Literature ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Perception ', ' Exposure to ', ' Productivity ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Appendix ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Societies ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Texas ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' day ', ' Event ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Bladder ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' American ', ' intervention program ', ' Buffers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Categories ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Reporting ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Accounting ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' cost ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2008,71091,0.07120498734213546
"Recruiting Latino Smokers via the Internet: The Feasibility of Online Advertising    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use is a major preventable cause of cancer and disease burden among Latinos in the U.S. The rapid growth of the Latino population means there will be an increase from 7 million to over 16 million Latino smokers by 2050 if smoking rates remain unchecked. Millions of Latino smokers are now using the Internet and web-based cessation programs have a growing evidence base of efficacy. Recruitment of Latino smokers to web-based cessation studies has been difficult and little is known about effective recruitment strategies. Research is needed to determine if web-based cessation programs work for Latinos, by what mechanisms, and at what cost. For this research to be possible, however, it is first necessary to identify theory-driven recruitment strategies that are cost efficient in reaching online Latino smokers. This mixed-method study aims to develop and test the effectiveness of online banner advertising in recruiting online Latino smokers to a free, bilingual smoking cessation website. In the qualitative phase of the project, expert input and consumer testing with Latino smokers will guide the development of four online banner ads. Ads will cross cultural targeting (surface vs. deep) with message framing (gain vs. loss frame) to determine the optimal communication strategy. The quantitative phase of the project will use a 4x4 Latin Square design to test the effectiveness of online ads with four outcome metrics: 1) the absolute number of clicks on an ad, 2) the clickthrough- rate to the smoking cessation website, 3) number of Latino registrants on the cessation site, and 4) cost per registrant. The hypotheses tested are that deep targeted ads will outperform surface targeted ads, holding constant message frame, and that gain framed messages will outperform loss framed messages, holding constant cultural targeting. We will also explore the potential interaction between message framing and cultural targeting, as well as the cost efficiency of ad delivery. Data from the present study will be used in a future R01 to recruit Latinos into a web-based cessation program to test the reach and efficacy of this cessation modality. This project will advance communication science by testing specific theories related to message framing and cultural targeting. This project will also add knowledge to the science of dissemination and help strengthen the dissemination of science using direct to consumer marketing and the Internet as a new channel to reach online Latino smokers. Results from this study will provide a transportable model for how to reach and recruit other racial/ethnic minority groups to web-based trials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Internet cessation programs hold great potential to reduce smoking prevalence and cancer disparities among the millions of online Latino smokers. The first step in realizing this potential is to develop effective methods to recruit Latinos to web-based smoking cessation programs.          ",Recruiting Latino Smokers via the Internet: The Feasibility of Online Advertising,7451985,R21CA133319,"['Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' advocacy organizations ', ' prototype ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Radio ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Placement ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Advertising ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Depth ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Investments ', ' Language ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pliability ', ' pliable ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Newspapers ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Community Networks ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Persuasive Communication ', ' Persuasion ', ' Physicians ', ' Smoker ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Participant ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' cultural values ', ' Modality ', ' Metric ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Gender ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' Advertisements ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' tobacco control ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' consumer demand ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' rapid growth ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' ']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,142519,0.06017140023282026
"Tobacco Product Use in Young African American Men of the Black Belt Counties    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans bear a disproportionate burden of tobacco-related disease. This proposal is prompted by the investigators' grim clinical experience with head and neck cancer in African Americans. Incidence rates of this disease are disproportionately high in the Black Belt counties of Alabama and mortality rates are doubled in African American (AA) men as compared to white men. Approximately 90% of the cases of this devastating disease would be eliminated by tobacco avoidance. This pilot project explores the use of ""alternative"" tobacco products among young adult AA men in some of the Black Belt counties; a practice that may be a gateway to lifelong tobacco dependence.       This proposal is submitted in response to RFA-CA-07-501 under the NCI Community Network Program. The parent grant for this pilot project is the Deep South Network for Cancer Control (DSN). The goals of the DSN are to improve access to and utilization of proven beneficial cancer interventions and to develop a cadre of well-trained researchers who will continue to address reduction and elimination of cancer disparities. Following the Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) principles, DSN developed a comprehensive ""Community Action Plan"" (CAP) in collaboration with the targeted communities. The community members' priorities centered on healthy lifestyle changes (including nutrition, physical activity, and tobacco control), and cancer screening. However, they also concluded that further work is needed before culturally relevant programs focusing on tobacco control are developed, and recommended that pilot projects focus on this topic. Therefore, this pilot project is a result of a direct recommendation from the targeted communities, it addresses an issue outlined in their CAP, and it will be implemented in conjunction with the DSN community partners. This project will provide groundwork for a culturally relevant tobacco prevention or cessation intervention in the Black Belt counties. Compelling findings may also significantly impact future directions for the parent DSN program.             ",Tobacco Product Use in Young African American Men of the Black Belt Counties,7460122,U01CA114619,"['Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Rate ', ' Placement ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Alabama ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Incidence ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Measurement ', ' Maintenance ', ' Marihuana ', ' marijuana ', ' Medicine ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Music ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' Health Psychology ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Smoking ', ' programs ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Work ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' behavior change ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Cigarette ', ' Cigar ', ' member ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' County ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Actions ', ' tobacco control ', ' tobacco prevention ', ' tobacco use prevention ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Deep South ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community based participatory research ', ' bidis ', ' parent grant ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2008,63000,0.057921470308730814
"Internet Based Voucher Reinforcement for Smoking Cessation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Internet-Based Voucher Reinforcement for Smoking Cessation: Tobacco use continues to be the number one preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. In no other population are the prevalence rates and problems of smoking more apparent and pronounced than those in rural populations, where access to treatment is limited. Current smoking cessation interventions are modestly effective, which suggest the need for therapies that are more intensive, innovative, and accessible. Voucher-based abstinence reinforcement therapy is a highly intensive approach wherein patients earn monetary vouchers that can be exchanged for goods and services contingent on documented abstinence. To improve the accessibility of this intensive therapy to smokers who want to quit smoking, a novel voucher based abstinence reinforcement therapy for smoking has been developed wherein smoking status is frequently monitored and reinforced via the internet. With this internet based intervention, real-time video of smokers providing CO samples are collected and verified for smoking status. Patients are then provided feedback and reinforcement based on their verified smoking status. This innovative approach may be well suited for rural smokers who are in need of accessible intensive smoking cessation interventions. This grant application proposes exploratory research to adapt, implement, and evaluate a novel internet based voucher reinforcement intervention for smoking cessation in heavy smokers in rural Kentucky. A pilot study is proposed in which rural smokers in Kentucky (N=80) will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: contingent vs. noncontingent vouchers group. For 6 weeks, CO samples will be collected and verified twice daily from all participants using an internet based CO monitoring system. Participants assigned to the contingent vouchers group will receive monetary vouchers if they provide a CO sample <4ppm. Participants in the noncontingent vouchers group will receive vouchers independent of their CO sample. Overall, the application proposes research to develop and evaluate an intensive and accessible smoking cessation intervention for heavy smokers in rural communites, and provide the empirical basis for future research.           ",Internet Based Voucher Reinforcement for Smoking Cessation,7433707,R21CA124881,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Elements ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Smoking Status ', ' Monitor ', ' Rate ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Medical ', ' Kentucky ', ' Numbers ', ' Rural ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Daily ', ' Smoker ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement (Psychology) ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Rural Population ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachia ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Week ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Services ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Rural Community ', ' Sampling ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' voucher ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R21,2008,149225,0.3096137419081925
"Faith Moves Mountains: A CBPR Appalachian Wellness & Cancer Prevention Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Appalachian communities are disproportionately affected by many of the leading risk factors associated with cancer incidence and mortality, factors amenable to primary and secondary prevention. Extensive involvement with our community partners has demonstrated strong community preference for a holistic approach toward cancer prevention; The proposed intervention extends our successful faith-based, trained lay health advisor tailored intervention, ""Faith Moves Mountains,"" (R01CA108696) initiated three years ago, to administer a culturally appropriate CBPR intervention. Working in partnership with 70 faith based institutions in rural Southeastern Kentucky, we propose to administer, evaluate, and disseminate a tailored wellness and cancer prevention program focused on four of the most common prevention activities that have the potential of greatly preventing and reducing cancer morbidity and mortality. These prevention activities include smoking cessation (targeting all chronic diseases, cervical and lung cancer); energy balance including dietary modification and physical activity promotion (targeting all chronic diseases and colorectal cancer (CRC)), and cancer screenings (targeting CRC, cervical, and breast cancer).      Consistent with our Faith Moves Mountains and cancer control approach, faith-based organizations will sponsor a ""kick off event"" or health fair in which participants will undergo a health risk appraisal (baseline). Participants will then select one or more wellness activities (smoking cessation, energy balance, cancer screening); then, trained lay health advisors will offer modules on each of these wellness activities. Smoking cessation will include the culturally relevant Cooper-Clayton method (outcome: smoking abstinence). For those targeting dietary modification and physical activity, a rural Appalachian modified Healthy Body/Healthy Spirit program will be administered (outcome: dietary change and physical activity participation). Tailored cancer screening promotion will be based on our current Faith Moves Mountains design (outcome: receipt of any recommended CRC screening test, Pap test for cervical cancer, and/or mammogram). To assess the intervention but remain consistent with community norms, we will employ a staggered intervention design. Throughout the project, the RE-AIM model will inform our evaluation. During phase three, this CBPR wellness approach to cancer prevention will undertake qualitative process evaluation interviews and disseminate the intervention to medically underserved Appalachian Ohio in collaboration with partners at Ohio State University. This collaboration will facilitate dissemination of successful intervention to additional rural Appalachian populations with high rates of cancer health disparities.           ",Faith Moves Mountains: A CBPR Appalachian Wellness & Cancer Prevention Program,7492539,R24MD002757,"['cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Abstinence ', ' National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities ', ' NCMHD ', ' medically underserved ', ' community based participatory research ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diet ', ' Institution ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Secondary Cancer Prevention ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Fairs ', ' Health Risk Appraisals ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Cervical ', ' Phase ', ' Incidence ', ' Ensure ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Kentucky ', ' Trust ', ' Rural ', ' Fostering ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Ohio ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rural Health ', ' Smoking ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Event ', ' preference ', ' cancer risk ', ' energy balance ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Diet Modification ', ' Dietary Modifications ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diet and exercise ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R24,2008,579454,0.015174484524118882
"The Influence of HIV Disease Events/Stages on Smoking Attitudes and Behaviors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While mortality attributable to AIDS-related diseases has decreased dramatically in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, the proportion of deaths attributable to other diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and cancer) has markedly increased. Thus, efforts to reduce morbidity and mortality attributable to these non-AIDS defining diseases represent an important public health priority. One approach to improve health outcomes for this population is to target health-risk behaviors, such as cigarette smoking. Existing evidence indicates that smoking prevalence is significantly elevated among persons living with HIV/AIDS. In addition, smoking is associated with numerous HIV-related adverse outcomes. Despite these findings, few efforts have been made to deliver cessation treatment to this population. Also lacking are efforts to explore the relationship between HIV disease events/stages and smoking. Thus, the overarching goal of this project is to prospectively explore the relationship between HIV disease events/stages, perceived impact of HIV, attitudes about smoking, and smoking behaviors. HIV disease events/stages (e.g., time of HIV diagnosis, progressive disease, and stable disease) will be evaluated as potential teachable moments for smoking cessation. Specifically, we will identify and recruit newly HIV-diagnosed smokers from a large, inner city HIV/AIDS care center serving a racially/ethnically diverse, medically indigent population. Participants will complete a computer-administered assessment designed to measure perceived impact of HIV, attitudes about smoking, and current smoking behavior at the time of study enrollment. In addition to traditional self-report measures, certain variables (e.g., perceived impact of HIV) will be assessed using ""implicit"" cognitive psychological measures, as considerable evidence suggests that both explicit and implicit measures yield unique information that predicts outcome. Participants will be followed for one year and asked to complete follow-up computer- administered assessments at three-month intervals. In addition to clinic administered assessments, participants will complete brief weekly phone assessments that will allow us to carefully track changes in perceived impact of disease and smoking behavior for the first three months of follow-up. Research staff will also conduct medical record reviews to document the timing and progression of disease (e.g., treatment failure, diagnosis of an HIV- or non-HIV related disease). This design will enable us to carefully track changes in smoking behavior over time, and to link these changes to both the course of HIV-disease and/or to participants' perceived impact of HIV. By identifying optimal time points for intervention, findings will have the potential to maximize the efficiency and efficacy of cessation treatments delivered in resource-limited settings. In addition, findings will be instrumental in identifying specific constructs that should be targeted for intervention, and will provide a strong foundation for the development of future cessation interventions targeting smokers living with HIV/AIDS.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed study will provide important information about the relationship between HIV-disease events/stages and smoking behavior among a low socio-economic status, racially/ethnically diverse population. Specifically, findings will identify potential teachable moments for cessation interventions in the course of HIV-disease, and will provide a strong foundation for the development of future cessation interventions targeting this population.          ",The Influence of HIV Disease Events/Stages on Smoking Attitudes and Behaviors,7555012,R01CA132636,"['critical developmental period ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Progressive Disease ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' AIDS Population ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Rate ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Intention ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Priorities ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Learning ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Medical Indigency ', ' medically indigent ', ' medical indigence ', ' Medical Indigencies ', ' Medical Records ', ' Morbidity -

"En Pareja: A Latino couples intervention to help expectant fathers quit smoking    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking among Latino males living in the U.S. is a significant public health problem. Latinos smoke at the same rate as White males but are less likely than Whites to quit smoking, which can contribute to health disparities in life expectancy and increase mortality due to lung cancer. Clearly, smoking cessation programs for Latinos are needed. Some programs tested among Latinos have shown efficacy, but at the short-term only. Further, none has attempted to encourage cessation at a teachable moment: a time when cessation may seem more relevant. To reach this underserved population of smokers, we are proposing to conduct a teachable moment intervention trial for recently immigrated Latino smokers in Durham and Raleigh, North Carolina. We will conduct the interventions in Spanish. We will attempt to capitalize on the teachable moment of Latinas' pregnancy as an impetus for Latinos' cessation because pregnancy is a time when men might consider stopping smoking. Also, including the woman could help sustain cessation after the program is complete. Thus, we are intervening with Latino couples to help the men quit smoking. We have partnered with community leaders at El Centro Hispano, a community resource center for Latinos in Durham. We will develop an intervention based primarily on Social Cognitive Theory and the Teachable Moments Model. We will teach men smoking cessation skills, help improve men's self-efficacy and outcome expectancies for quitting, and teach the couples optimal ways to communicate to reduce the stress that comes with a new baby. With better communication, the couple may be able to work together better to help him quit smoking and stay quit. We are proposing to recruit pregnant Latino couples (n=420) into a two-arm smoking cessation intervention. The program will be culturally tailored to emphasize Latino cultural values that could contribute to higher cessation rates, namely familismo, a high value on the family, and personalismo, valuing warm personal relationships. The study arms are: Arm 1: Self-help smoking cessation guide vs. Arm 2: Couple-based smoking cessation counseling. We propose to survey couples face-to-face at five time-points: baseline, 28 weeks gestation, and 2, 6, and 12 months postpartum. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The smoking rate among Latino males is too high. Few effective programs reach and promote long term smoking cessation among Latino Spanish-speaking smokers. This intervention approaches Latinos when their wives are pregnant to increase motivation for quitting. The intervention includes Latinas and teaches the couples effective communication skills to help sustain cessation effects long term.           ",En Pareja: A Latino couples intervention to help expectant fathers quit smoking,7524323,R01CA127307,"['Counseling ', ' Couples ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Caribbean natives ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Elements ', ' Emotions ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Rate ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Language ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Individual ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Mexican ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Wife ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' North Carolina ', ' Couples Therapy ', ' Perception ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Smoker ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Relapse ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' South American ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Week ', ' Upper arm ', ' Country ', ' Patient currently pregnant ', ' gravid Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy not delivered ', ' Gravid ', ' self help ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' cultural values ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' volunteer ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' ']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,653720,0.16376482767247744
"Using CBPR to Implement Smoking Cessation in an Urban American Indian Community    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) have the highest smoking rates any ethnic group in the United States, at 41% versus 24% for African Americans and Whites. They also have the lowest quit rates of any group, at 8-10% at 6 months. Due to its long cultural significance as a sacred plant, the entirely negative portrayal of tobacco in most smoking cessation programs is inappropriate, leaving programs unsuccessful. In 2003, AI/AN patients from Haskell Health Center requested a culturally-appropriate smoking cessation program, causing the center director to contact the University of Kansas Medical Center Department of Preventive Medicine. Since that time, the larger AI/AN community in Kansas and Missouri has been working collaboratively with KUMC on the development of a culturally-tailored smoking cessation program, as well as several other projects. In 2006, KUMC and several community-based organizations formed the American Indian Health Research and Education Alliance, dedicated to improving the health of AI/AN using community-based participatory research methods. The culturally-tailored smoking cessation program that began the partnership, All Nations Breath of Life (ANBL), has now been developed and pilot tested and is ready for implementation in the urban AI/AN community of the Kansas City Metroplex. Our pilot data are promising; with a 25% quit rate and 80% participant retention at 6-months post-baseline. We will address the following specific aims: (1) To create appropriate infrastructure (personnel, space, supplies, leadership commitment) for the Heart of America Indian Center to serve as the primary site for implementation of ANBL; (2) To examine the acceptability and feasibility of implementing ANBL in an urban AI/AN community; (3) To estimate the effectiveness of ANBL in an urban AI/AN community; and (4) to identify factors that enhance dissemination of ANBL and contribute to program success or failure. We hypothesize that participants in ANBL will quit smoking at a higher rate than currently reported in the literature for the best available programs. In addition, we will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the program to help determine its sustainability. If this project is successful, ANBL can be disseminated to other AI/AN communities to help them quit smoking. By reducing smoking rates in this community, we can ultimately reduce their leading cause of cancer death (lung cancer) and their leading cause of overall death, cardiovascular disease.           ",Using CBPR to Implement Smoking Cessation in an Urban American Indian Community,7493881,R24MD002773,"['Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' All Sites ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adoption ', ' enhancing factor ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Kansas ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Leadership ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Living Wills ', ' living will ', ' Logic ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Maintenance ', ' Americas ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Missouri ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Native Americans ', ' Patients ', ' Plants ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Smoker ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Medical center ', ' success ', ' intervention program ', ' Participant ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Native Alaskan ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' County ', ' Native-Born ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' tobacco control ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' community living ', ' urban native american ', ' urban American Indian ', ' Outcome ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R24,2008,588540,0.2263235474721998
"The Impact of a Tobacco Control Intervention in African-American Families    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly 25 million US adults and 6.4 million children living today will die prematurely from tobacco-attributable diseases unless adults are successful with cessation and rates of child tobacco use are halted. Fifteen million US children <18 years old are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) mostly in their homes and parent modeling of smoking is identified as an important factor for the 4,000 children who initiate tobacco use each day. With widening gaps in health disparities for African Americans (AAs) related to the health effects of tobacco use, culturally sensitive approaches that may be effective need to be fully tested. Based on concepts from Social Cognitive Theory and taking a social ecological perspective, this research will investigate the effects of a family approach that includes child and parent/guardian (PIG) interventions on tobacco control. Subjects will include 4th grade AA children (N=400) and Ps/Gs; 50% rural and 50% inner-city. Using a two group design with repeated measures, schools (20) will be randomly assigned to treatment or control. Children and Ps/Gs in the treatment group will receive a yearly intervention for two years and the control group will receive matched contact and attention on general health education. The child intervention (Botvin's LifeSkills (BLS) consist of 8 classroom sessions taught during 4th and 5th grades (16 total sessions) by trained school personnel. The PIG intervention (BLS Parent) consists of 8 home-based modules during the 4th and 5th grades that promote PIG use of anti- tobacco socialization in the home and reinforce the school-based child intervention. Ps/Gs who smoke will also receive motivational interviewing and nicotine replacement therapy based on their readiness to quit. Behavioral change will be measured by self-report in children and Ps/Gs at baseline, 12 weeks (short-term) and 9 months (long-term) after each year of intervention (2) and also via salivary cotinine at three time points (baseline, at year 2 and at year 4). We propose this family approach will foster development of personal and environmental protective factors in children and their Ps/Gs for tobacco control. The primary hypotheses are: Children and Ps/ Gs in the treatment group will have improved behavioral outcomes of: 1) lower ETS exposure in children; 2) lower rates of tobacco experimentation in children; 3) higher PIG self-efficacy in delivering anti-tobacco socialization in the home; and 4) higher tobacco cessation rates in Ps/Gs. This research addresses a significant public health concern, tobacco use, which remains the single most preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. Consistent with both the NCI and the NICHD, this application targets the advancement of socio-cultural behavioral treatments for children and their families, the prevention of tobacco-related diseases, particularly cancer, and the elimination of health disparities among an ethnic minority group-AA. The need for theory-based effective interventions validated by biochemical measures is imperative for tobacco control. If effective, implementation of this family approach via the school systems as the primary point of entry is highly probable.           ",The Impact of a Tobacco Control Intervention in African-American Families,7474774,R01CA118066,"['Control Groups ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' tobacco control ', ' tobacco prevention ', ' tobacco use prevention ', ' tobacco exposure ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' 18 year old ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Abstinence ', ' treatment effect ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Today ', ' Child Support ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Environmental Tobacco Smoke ', ' secondhand smoke ', ' second hand smoke ', ' environmental tobacco smoke exposure ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Murder ', ' Self Management ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accidents ', ' Communities ', ' Cotinine ', ' Scotine ', ' 2-Pyrrolidinone, 1-methyl-5-(3-pyridinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Sus scrofa ', ' Wild Boar ', ' Porcine Species ', ' Pigs Mammals ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' End Point ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Indigenous ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Study Section ', ' Smoking Status ', ' Rate ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Killings ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' USA Georgia ', ' Western Asia Georgia ', ' Georgian SSR ', ' Georgian S.S.R.

"Ethnic Health/Motivating HIV+ Latinos to Quit Smoking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in the treatment of HIV disease have shown dramatic effects on improving immune function in a significant proportion of people infected with HIV in the US. For the first time since the beginning of the HIV epidemic, individuals with HIV are faced with the prospect of living longer, healthier lives. Cigarette smoking is highly prevalent among HIV+ individuals and, in addition to the negative health effects associated with smoking, poses unique health risks to those with HIV. Our research program is designed to improve the health and quality of life of HTV+ individuals and determine the most efficacious approaches to smoking cessation for diverse subpopulations of these patients. Building on results from our study of a brief motivational smoking cessation intervention among HIV+ smokers in Southern New England, the primary goal of this research program is to target the intervention specifically to Latino patients. Latinos make up 13% of the population, yet account for 18.5% of all AIDS cases reported through December 2002, making the Latino AIDS rate 4 times higher than that of non-Hispanic Whites.6 Research is limited in the area of HIV among Latinos and there are no studies to date that address the problem of tobacco use among HIV+ Latinos. We propose to address this disparity by focusing this research study on Latino men and women living with HIV/AIDS. Our goal is to develop and evaluate a clinic based culturally tailored smoking cessation treatment for a largely low-income, Latino, HIV+ population. We will compare this culturally sensitive intervention that incorporates a strong social support component to a standard care control condition, in a randomized controlled trial. We hypothesize that those Latinos receiving the Culturally Tailored Intervention will demonstrate greater biochemically verified smoking abstinence rates at 12- months post-baseline than those receiving a Standard Care Intervention control treatment. Hypotheses will be tested regarding the main effect of acculturation on smoking quit rates in the two treatment conditions. Critical information regarding how the intervention reaches patients and with whom it is most effective will be uncovered by examining mediators and moderators of the intervention-smoking cessation relationship. This study will be the first to examine different smoking cessation treatments in a Latino HIV+ population and the results will have implications for importing culturally sensitive and cost effective cessation treatments into clinical care settings.

"Smokers' Quitline for Asian Language Speakers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study is motivated by the serious public health problems caused by smoking and by the paucity of evidence-based cessation service for smokers of ethnic minority backgrounds. The study tests the effects of telephone counseling for smokers from three Asian language-speaking groups: Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese. Asian Americans are among the least studied groups in smoking research, which has created a knowledge gap in understanding their behavior and in developing methods to help them quit. No efficacy data have been reported for telephone counseling of smokers who prefer to use Asian languages, although telephone intervention holds promise for these groups because of its convenience and its potential to reach large number of smokers.  The specific aims are to: (1) test the efficacy of a culturally sensitive counseling protocol for smokers calling the California Smokers' Helpline on its Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese lines, (2) examine whether intervention effects are moderated by acculturation, (3) examine whether intervention effects vary by cognitive and behavioral predictors of cessation success, (4) examine whether family involvement plays a role in quitting success, and (5) assess differences in counseling effect across the three ethnic groups.  In this two-arm design subjects are stratified by language (Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese) and gender and randomized to telephone counseling or self-help materials, which serves as the control. Subjects (N=2,100) will provide baseline information on demographics, smoking behavior, quitting history, and other psychosocial variables. Independent evaluations at 4, 7, and 13 months after intake will determine whether subjects made a quit attempt and how successful they were at remaining abstinent. This rich data set will also be used to analyze whether acculturation, family involvement, and baseline behavioral and cognitive variables modify the intervention effect.  The proposed study is significant in several ways. First, it will provide timely information on a cessation approach for a traditionally under-served population (Asian language speakers). Second, if proven successful, telephone counseling can be widely applied because of the proliferation of quitlines with centralized services in recent years. Third, by targeting Asian language speakers this study addresses the issue of ethnic disparities, which has been identified by many (including the NCI Bypass Budget) as a research priority.

"Literacy and Smoking Risk Communications    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For over 90 million adults - nearly half of all adults in the United States - difficulty with health literacy interferes with the capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information. Moreover, these individuals have an increased risk of disease. Because tobacco smoking is the leading behavioral risk factor that contributes to social disparities in the incidence and mortality of disease, effectively providing low-literate smokers with information concerning the health consequences of smoking is critical. Therefore, the primary aim of the proposed study is to examine how health literacy influences responses to smoking risk messages manipulated in terms of message framing and emotionality. In addition to traditional questionnaires, outcomes will be assessed using ""implicit"" cognitive psychological measures. Thus, the proposed study examines the immediate effects of different types of smoking risk messages on cognition in a laboratory setting. Findings will have important implications for the future development of smoking cessation interventions targeted at low literacy populations. Smokers with varying levels of health literacy (i.e., inadequate, marginal, adequate) will listen to one of four different types of smoking risk messages recorded on a computer in the form of audio scripts (i.e., a human voice pre-recorded on a computer will read each message) and concurrently presented in written form via a computer monitor. They will be written at a fifth- to sixth-grade reading level and manipulated in terms of 1) framing (i.e., gain-framed messages that highlight the benefits of quitting vs. loss-framed messages that emphasize the costs of failing to quit), and 2) emotionality (i.e., primarily fact-based vs. primarily emotion-based). Framing and emotionality will be completely crossed to create four different types of messages, 1) factual gain-framed, 2) factual loss-framed, 3) emotional gain-framed, and 4) emotional loss-framed. The primary specific aims are to examine: 1) whether main effects emerge for health literacy (inadequate, marginal, adequate) and the different message types (fact-based vs. emotion-based and gain-framed vs. loss-framed) on the primary explicit and implicit outcome measures: a) intention to quit smoking, and b) implicit and explicit attitudes toward smoking, and 2) whether health literacy interacts with the different message types (fact- vs. emotion-based and gain- vs. loss- framed) to influence the primary explicit and implicit outcome measures: a) intention to quit smoking, and b) implicit and explicit attitudes toward smoking. A secondary, exploratory aim is to examine potential associations between explicit and implicit outcomes. Findings will shed light on important cognitive mechanisms that may influence the potency of smoking risk messages across the health literacy spectrum. Moreover, findings will be directly relevant to translation of the basic behavioral science underlying smoking risk communications into enhanced smoking cessation treatment approaches.           ",Literacy and Smoking Risk Communications,7386617,R01CA125413,"['Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Emotions ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Reader ', ' Cognitive ', ' Low Literacy Population ', ' Smoking and Health Research ', ' Smoking and Health ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Intention ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Glass ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Housing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Health Campaign ', ' Incidence ', ' Computer information processing ', ' Evaluation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Visual ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' literacy ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Descriptor ', ' Nurses ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Smoker ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Reading ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Attitude ', ' Voice ', ' Writing ', ' Dimensions ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' interest ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' treatment program ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' literate ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Prevention ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' response ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Cognition ', ' Communication ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Basic Behavioral Science ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' computer monitor ', ' Computers ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2008,292600,0.08020283836338779
"The Effects of Neighborhood Characteristics on Smoking Cessation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco-related lung cancer is a leading cause of death among adults, and tobacco use accounts for -30% of cancer incidence and mortality. Therefore, eliminating tobacco uptake, increasing rates of tobacco cessation, and preventing smoking relapse are the cornerstones of cancer prevention. Moreover, a focus on groups disproportionately affected by tobacco use (e.g., minorities, low socioeconomic status (SES) groups, or populations at increased risk of relapse) is of clear importance in the fight against cancer. Previous research has shown that neighborhood-level SES is independently associated with higher smoking prevalence, but the role of the neighborhood in smoking outcome during a specific quit attempt has not been studied. The primary aim of this research is to examine how neighborhood characteristics influence the mechanisms underlying the process of smoking cessation and relapse prevention during a specific quit attempt among diverse community samples at increased risk for health disparities in cancer. Archival data will be examined from 4 study populations: Spanish speaking Hispanic smokers (n = 297), African-American smokers (n = 400), African-American, English speaking Hispanic, and Caucasian smokers in equal numbers (n = 420), and pregnant women who quit smoking and want to remain quit postpartum (n = 450). Specific aims of this project are to: i) Evaluate the relation between neighborhood characteristics (including neighborhood-level SES, racial/ethnic composition, neighborhood problems, vigilance, social cohesion, and social control) and smoking abstinence; 2) Evaluate the relation of stress, depression, negative affect, self-efficacy, and social support with neighborhood characteristics and with smoking abstinence, respectively; and 3) Evaluate whether self-efficacy, depression, negative affect, stress, and/or social support mediate an observed association between neighborhood characteristics and abstinence. In a series of 4 studies, I will use multilevel modeling to examine the pathways through which the neighborhood context influences cessation using both questionnaire and ecological momentary assessment data, as well as sophisticated geographical software to map neighborhood-level demographic and economic data. These efforts will result in a better understanding of disparities in smoking status among underserved populations and provide information important for improving service to individuals from those communities, thereby affecting public health.          ",The Effects of Neighborhood Characteristics on Smoking Cessation,7493597,K01DP001120,[''],NCCDPHP,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K01,2008,188536,0.16738885007835763
"Dissemination of a Smoking Quitline to the Underserved  Smoking is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States. Moreover, smoking is a critically significant behavioral risk factor that contributes to social disparities in the incidence and mortality of disease. That is, because the prevalence of smoking is higher among individuals with lower socioeconomic status, smoking has a substantial influence on socioeconomic disparities in health- related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, connecting underserved smokers with evidence-based tobacco cessation programs is crucial for disease prevention and the elimination of health disparities. Telephone- based counseling for smoking cessation delivered via quitlines has demonstrated considerable efficacy. However, quitlines are grossly underutilized. Referrals to quitlines generated in primary care settings are low, and a large majority of smokers referred to quitlines fail to contact the quitlines on their own for cessation assistance. Thus, the focus of this study is on increasing dissemination of an existing evidence- based smoking cessation program, the State of Texas Quitline (i.e., Quitline), which is provided by the American Cancer Society. The design of the study is a group-randomized trial that will be conducted in 10 community health clinics. Clinics are part of the Harris County Hospital District (HCHD) and provide care to a very large, racially/ethnically diverse, low socioeconomic status, underserved population of patients residing in the Houston metropolitan area. Clinics will be randomized to either an ""Ask-Advise-Connect"" or an ""Ask-Advise-Refer"" dissemination approach. Smoking status will be assessed and recorded in the electronic medical record (EMR) at every patient visit, and smokers will be connected (in the Ask-Advise- Connect condition) or referred (in the Ask-Advise-Refer control condition) to the Quitline through an automated link contained in the EMR. Smokers in the Ask-Advise-Connect condition will be called proactively by the Quitline, and smokers in the Ask-Advise-Refer condition will be encouraged to call the Quitline on their own. All smokers will be offered a series of proactive counseling calls during their initial call with the Quitline. The project will involve a close partnership and collaboration with the HCHD community health clinics. Outcome measures are based on the RE-AIM conceptual framework and are consistent with current dissemination research models. Primary outcomes include reach, efficacy, and impact of the dissemination approaches. Secondary outcomes include patient-reported fidelity as well as acceptance of and barriers to dissemination of the Quitline among clinic staff. The Ask-Advise-Connect approach to dissemination of an evidence-based tobacco cessation program could be easily maintained by the HCHD clinics and adopted by other health care settings. Thus, findings are likely to have a significant public health impact.

"CBPR Inquiry to Reduce Smoking Among Native Hawaiian and Filipina Girls in Hawaii    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While cancer mortality is increasing for Native Hawaiians and Filipino Americans, rates are decreasing for most other Asian and Pacific Islanders, and this continued increase is due in part to the increase in lung cancer for Native Hawaiian and Filipino females. Likewise, although tobacco use prevalence among AAPI youth is much lower compared to non-AAPI youth, disparities appear when the ethnicities and gender are disaggregated. Native Hawaiian and Filipino girls smoke at high rates compared to other AAPI girls. The high smoking rates among some ethnic groups indicate that youth prevention programs are not reaching significant portions of our nation's ethnically diverse population. Research is needed to better understand smoking attitudes, behavior, and sociocultural factors among Native Hawaiian and Filipino girls so that ""optimally effective"" tobacco education programs may be tailored. This pilot project aims to investigate knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and sociocultural factors that may be related to the high tobacco use among Native Hawaiian and Filipina girls in Hawaii, using community-based participatory research approaches, to develop future innovative culturally-based youth delivered anti-smoking prevention and cessation interventions. This project partners with six community organizations who represent advocates for the Native Hawaiian and Filipino communities, youth health promotion, and tobacco prevention and control in Hawaii. The partners will provide guidance and assistance with planning and implementing this project. Peer facilitators will lead 12-15 ethnically separate focus groups comprised of 6-10 Native Hawaiian and Filipino girls at middle and high schools where the community partners have existing relationships. Focus group questions posed will cover facilitators and barriers toward smoking and strateiges to prevent or stop smoking among their peers. Data analysis will facilitate reliability and validity of the qualitative procedures. The PL and co-PL will separately review notes and audio recordings, and completed data analysis forms will be reviewed together to compare common themes, discuss, and resolve discrepancies. Results will inform a youth led, anti-smoking program relevant for Native Hawaiian and Filipina girls.             ",CBPR Inquiry to Reduce Smoking Among Native Hawaiian and Filipina Girls in Hawaii,7468126,U01CA114630,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Advocate ', ' Smoking Prevention ', ' Rate ', ' Compatible ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Female ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Procedures ', ' Hawaii ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Filipino ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Hawaiian population ', ' Hawaiian ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Tobacco ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' American ', ' Filipino American ', ' high school ', ' Buffers ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Gender ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' anti-smoking ', ' tobacco prevention ', ' tobacco use prevention ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NCI,PAPA OLA LOKAHI,U01,2008,69200,0.06242212465126265
"Ecological Monetary Assessment of Smoking Cessation in Spanish-Speaking Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My goal is to become an independent investigator focusing on health disparities research with a particular interest in smoking cessation among minority populations. The specific aim of this project is to examine the mechanisms underlying the process of smoking cessation and relapse among Spanish-speaking smokers, and how these mechanisms are influenced by factors such as education and acculturation. The proposed study will address these issues by examining real-time, momentary changes in affect, self-efficacy, expectancies, motivation, craving, stress, and social support in the natural environment. Participants will be Spanish-speaking community smokers (N=140) recruited from the greater Houston area. Participants will be tracked for 3 contiguous weeks (from a week prior to their quit date through two weeks after their quit date) using state-of-the-science ecological momentary assessment (EMA) procedures (Stone & Shiftman, 2002), All participants will receive smoking cessation treatment consisting of nicotine patch therapy, self-help materials, and in-person counseling based on the Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence Clinical Practice Guideline (Fiore et al., 2000).To the best of our knowledge, this study will be the first among Spanish speaking smokers to evaluate the potential mechanisms underlying smoking cessation using palmtop administered EMA procedures to assess transient and context dependent constructs associated with smoking. Moreover, there is less research on how social factors influence smoking cessation as compared to smoking prevalence, and in particular, on how these factors influence specific mechanisms that affect cessation. Thus, this study will contribute unique knowledge to the field. Other unique contributions of this project include the longitudinal investigation of acute momentary phenomena, repeated assessment of daily experience, and analyses of trajectories overtime (both pre- and post-cessation) in a population of Spanish speaking smokers. The aims of the study are to 1) Examine the intrapersonal and contextual determinants/antecedents (e.g., craving, affect, self-efficacy, expectancies, stress, coping behavior, and social support) of daily experience, temptations to smoke, and smoking lapses among Spanish-speaking smokers during a quit attempt; and 2) Examine the influence of education and acculturation on these mechanisms of smoking relapse.          ",Ecological Monetary Assessment of Smoking Cessation in Spanish-Speaking Smokers,7469788,K07CA121037,"['Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Personal Digital Assistant ', ' Pocket Personal Computer ', ' Pocket PCs ', ' Personal Digital Assistant Computer ', ' Palmtop computer ', ' Palmtop ', ' Palm-top computer ', ' Palm-top ', ' Palm Pilot ', ' PDA Computer ', ' Blueberry Device ', ' BlackBerry Device ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Advertising ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Daily ', ' Smoker ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' nicotine patch ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' Stress ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Investigation ', ' Week ', ' Dependence ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' self help ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Calculi ', ' Stone ', ' Biliary or Urinary Stones ', ' Participant ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' social ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' craving ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communities ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' Minority ', ' Expectancy ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coping Behavior ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K07,2008,118123,0.3013813899733984
"The Effects of Smoking and Expectancy on ERP Measures of Attentional Bias    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The focus of this proposal is to provide the applicant with the skills, experience, and mentoring to become an independent researcher with a focus on understanding the neurobehavioral determinants of nicotine dependence. The training plan outlined in this proposal will allow me to expand my skills by providing an opportunity to become proficient in the use of event-related potential (ERP) electroencephalography (EEC) techniques to study attentional and emotional mechanisms related to nicotine dependence. This work will be conducted at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, where I will be mentored by distinguished scientists in the field of nicotine dependence. This multidisciplinary team will provide oversight of my research and training experiences by providing specific expertise in the areas of neurobehavior, ERP, attentional biases, and gender differences of smoking. The focus of the Research Plan is to gain a greater understanding of the attentional biases of smokers in order to expand our knowledge of how drug and affective cues help to maintain neural sensitization to drugs of abuse. The proposed study would be the first to evaluate the attentional bias of smokers using a within-subjects balanced placebo design, allowing for the separation of the effects of nicotine from the effects of smoking cues on ERP attentional response to smoking and affective cues. The specific aims of this proposal are (a) to distinguish the effects of nicotine's pharmacological properties from those resulting from learned associations on the attentional distraction by smoking and affective cues in dependent smokers, (b) to determine whether gender differences exist in the attentional distraction by smoking and affective cues, (c) to determine whether the expectation of imminent tobacco use increases the attentional distraction by smoking and affective cues, and (d) to assess whether ERP measures of attentional distraction by smoking and affective cues correlate with traditional self-reported measures of nicotine dependence, craving, and affect.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Smoking dependence is thought to be maintained by the brain's attentional bias towards cues in the environment that remind the dependent invidual of smoking. This study will use event-related potential (ERP) EEG technology to investigate these attentional biases and circumstances that provoke them.           ",The Effects of Smoking and Expectancy on ERP Measures of Attentional Bias,7447041,K23DA024697,"['Cues ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Legal ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' distraction ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center ', ' University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ', ' MDACC ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Female ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' career ', ' human subject ', ' Grant ', ' Area ', ' Peripheral Nervous System ', ' indexing ', ' Training ', ' Laboratories ', ' Stimulus ', ' Deception ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' event related potential ', ' Placebos ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' psychophysical ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Reaction Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Condition ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Technology ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Scientist ', ' Association Learning ', ' Attention ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Dependence ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Digit structure ', ' Digit ', ' experience ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cigarette ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Cells ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' neurobehavior ', ' Instruction ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Expectancy ', ' Affective ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' drug of abuse ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' drugs abused ', ' abused drugs ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' visual information ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K23,2008,168739,0.19225013442872452
"CBPR to Reduce Tobacco Smoking among Residents of a Low-Income Urgan Setting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hugely disproportionate burden of death and disease borne by people of color and the poor is not a medical mystery, and its solution does not necessarily require high-tech interventions. Tobacco use is an excellent example because tobacco smoking is a substantial cause of death from five of the seven leading causes of death. Due to concerted public health efforts, smoking prevalence has been reduced by 30% over the last 15 years in the U.S. Yet not all have benefited equally in this great accomplishment. Most of our nation's educated and well-off individuals no longer smoke; the 21% of our adult population who continue to smoke are largely poor, undereducated, and underemployed.      The proposed R24 project ""CBPR to Reduce Tobacco Smoking among Residents of a Low-Income Urban Setting"" aims at reducing several health problems caused by or related to tobacco use among people of color and low-SES whites, through partnership with South West Baltimore community that will result in smoking cessation programs that are more effective and more culturally appropriate. Therefore, the specific aims for the proposed project are: (1) through CBPR and other rigorous scientific methods, develop, implement, and evaluate an intervention to reduce tobacco use that will be sensitive to the needs and characteristics of this community and produce a sustained reduction of tobacco smoking among 36% of the participants in the intervention; (2) to investigate specific marketing strategies that may affect consumption patterns; (3) to explore the ecological factors determining tobacco use and quitting behaviors in this community; and, (4) to implement information systems that will help the community track the scope and features of tobacco smoking, major risk and protective factors, in order to identify potential alternatives of action. The project is designed as Community Based Participatory Experimental Research, with mix quantitative and qualitative methods. Intense community involvement and active participation will be the core value of this proposed research. The effectiveness of interventions will be evaluated rigorously using individually tailored treatments with adaptive treatment strategies that use relatively new statistical approaches for effectiveness evaluations in community settings. ""Active"" and ""passive"" surveillance strategies will be used to analyze the scope, determinants, and dynamics of tobacco use in their community.          ",CBPR to Reduce Tobacco Smoking among

"Sex, GABA and Nicotine: A 1H-MRS Study While there are several note-worthy differences between males and females with regard to smoking behavior, ultimately none are as worrisome as the disparity in ability to quit smoking. Although multiple explanations for why women are less successful in their abstinence attempts have been proffered, the observation that women are more likely to experience emergence of depressive symptoms during smoking cessation, a known risk factor for relapse, may be a critical contributor to this sex-specific recidivism. Several lines of evidence suggest that nicotine modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) may play an important role in this interplay between sex, depression and smoking recidivism. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), our group has found reductions in occipital cortex GABA concentrations in subjects with unipolar depression and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Recently, we have published pilot data from healthy smoking men and women indicating that nicotine induced alterations in cortical GABA levels are found solely in women and are characterized by reduced GABA levels in the follicular phase and abolished menstrual cyclicity in GABA levels. Reductions in cortical GABA levels in women who smoke may therefore render them at increased risk for depression, which sabotages their attempts to quit. Thus, we propose to employ 1H-MRS to measure GABA levels in the occipital cortex of a larger group of healthy smoking and nonsmoking women and men to confirm the impact of sex as well as menstrual cycle phase on nicotine-induced alterations in cortical GABA concentrations. In addition, women will be invited to undergo 10-14 days of abstinence using contingency management so that we may examine the relationship between baseline GABA and changes in GABA with abstinence and emergence of negative affect and craving. This project is both novel and timely as it responds directly to the mandate from NIDA to examine the impact of sex-specific factors on substance abuse/dependence disorders in order to enhance long-term abstinence. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: The study outlined in this proposal will not only further our knowledge regarding the influence of nicotine on brain chemistry, it may also lead to new medications to enhance smoking cessation in females and/or others at risk for depression during smoking abstinence.

"Redes En Accion: National Latino Cancer Research Network Latino smokers are less likely to receive advice to stop smoking from health care providers or use behavioral counseling or cessation medications to try to quit. This study will develop and test an innovativesmoking cessation intervention, delivered via touchscreen computer kiosk, that targets low-income Latinos attending safety net clinics. The objective of this applicationis to evaluate the feasibility,cultural appropriateness, acceptability and preliminaryoutcomes of the kiosk, Decidete. Consistent with the Chronic Disease Model, Decidete is designed to promote productive discussions regarding smoking cessation between health care providers and their Latino patients. Decidete has been developed and implemented in two safety net clinics. It was designed to help Latinos decide whether and how to quit smoking, facilitate access to pharmacotherapy, and link smokers to existing state-funded tobacco quitlines. The current proposal is based on this pilot work and consists of two studies. Study 1 assesses the acceptability and cultural appropriateness of Decidete from the perspectives of clinic staff and Latino smokers. Data from this evaluation will be used to revise Decidete in order to optimize its feasibility and efficacy. Study 2 assesses the impact of the revised version of Decidete on interactions with health care providers, use of smoking cessation resources, quit attempts and smoking cessation. Participants will include Latino health care providers throughout the metro area and Latino smokers attending safety net clinics. This project is within the scope of Redes en Accion, a Community Network Project to improve access to cancer interventions. Our project will integrate a smoking cessation program into community safety net clinics where many Latinos obtain their health care. The program is highly feasible because it tests a free-standing computer program that will not create new demands on cliniciansbut will rather supplement their efforts. Moreover, it was developed with input from local Latino smokers and health care providers, and reflects national guidelines for smoking cessation intervention. Initial input suggests the touchscreen format, simple layout, and audio/visual presentation enables even low-literacy smokers to use Decidete. However, its cultural appropriateness and efficacy have yet to be evaluated. Successful implementation of this project will ensure the program meets the needs of Latino smokers and health care providers and will lay the groundwork for future large-scale efficacy trials. Although the plan is ambitious for a 1-year project, it is feasible because it builds on an existing, ongoing project on which this experienced research team is already collaborating. We will be able to collect valuable data from an understudied and largely underserved population. The proposed research will address a topic identified as a priority by providers, patients and national health agencies.

"Exploring the Role of Race/Ethnicity & Family Influences to Reduce Youth Smoking    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Introduction. Familial factors such as family bonding and parental monitoring have been indicated as explanatory factors for some of the differences in national trends in adolescent smoking initiation and progression. However, little is known about the link between racial/ethnic differences and these family factors with adolescent smoking practices. Purpose. The aims of this application are to examine how race/ethnicity influences the family factors that are influential on adolescents' initial smoking initiation and then progression over time. Aims. We propose to test a model of smoking behaviors guided by The Theory of Triadic Influence (TTI). Within the TTI, we will examine the underlying distal and ultimate influences of smoking behavior. Distal influences that will be examined are parental bonding and connectedness, anti-smoking parenting, and role modeling of smoking. Ultimate influences include parental supervision and monitoring, family conflict, and acculturation. Examination of these influences will address our central hypothesis that racial/ethnic differences in smoking behavior are associated with differences in family attachment as well as pro-smoking influences. Further, these factors will differentially remain consistent in racial/ethnic subgroups that have the lowest rates of smoking behavior throughout adolescence. Aim 1: To determine the relative impact of family and prosmoking influences on concurrent smoking behavior among cross-sectional cohorts of African American, Hispanic, and White youth in their early (ages 9-11), mid (ages 12-13), and late (ages 14-18) adolescent years. Aim 2: To determine which specific familial and prosmoking influences in early adolescence are associated with initiation of smoking within a year. Aim 3: To examine the associations of initial and continuing familial and prosmoking influences with smoking stage progression. Methods. Our hypothesis will be addressed through secondary analysis of The National Survey of Parents and Youth (NSPY). The NSPY collected data from parents (N=7,334 at Round 1) and youth (N=7,796 at Round 1) during each of Rounds 1-4 of NSPY from 1999-2004. Data will be used to provide cross-sectional and longitudinal tests of the models of the initiation and progression of smoking behavior from early to late adolescence. Analyses. To address the cross- sectional analyses, a multi-level modeling approach will be used. Multinomial regression will be used to examine the association of the individual factors with adolescent smoking, followed by assessment of a combined model. After examination of smoking trajectories, latent growth curve modeling will be used to explore changes over time and pathways to tobacco use initiation, incorporating the repeated measures while still allowing for the categorical nature of the outcome measure. Conclusion. By clarifying the role of specific familial factors protective for smoking initiation and progression in different racial/ethnic subgroups and ages, the proposed project may aid in the development of more effective parent-based smoking prevention programs designed for diverse adolescent populations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   There are racial/ethnic differences in the onset of adolescent smoking initiation and progression that may be explained by racial/ethnic differences in familial factors such as anti-smoking parenting practices. There is a strong need for new parental based anti-tobacco prevention interventions as a way to curb initiation and progression of adolescent smoking. However, it is unknown if familial factors that are protective in one racial sub-group are equally protective in another. The primary goal of this application is to explore how race/ethnicity affects familial factors that contribute to adolescents' smoking initiation and progression over time by secondary analysis of The National Survey of Parents and Youth. The results of this project will be essential to developing sound, culturally and age sensitive parental based anti-smoking interventions in the future.           PROJECT NARRATIVE  There are racial/ethnic differences in the onset of adolescent smoking initiation and progression that may be explained by racial/ethnic differences in familial factors such as anti-smoking parenting practices.

"Stress as a determinant of smoking among sub-populations of Blacks in the U.S.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Caribbean blacks have lower prevalence of smoking compared to African Americans. However, the protective effect of being foreign born is short-lived as there is a positive relationship between smoking behavior and length of stay in the U.S. Using a nationally representative dataset, the goal of this research proposal is to further identify associations between migration and smoking behaviors and then assess the extent to which stress influences smoking behaviors among Caribbean Black adults in the United States. The specific aims of this application are: 1) to investigate the relationships between migration status and history, and smoking behaviors among Caribbean Blacks; 2) to evaluate the extent to which chronic stress, specifically financial and social stress, influences the associations between migration and smoking among Caribbean Blacks; and 3) to assess the extent to which ethnicity moderates the relationship between social stress and smoking among sub-groups of Blacks (Caribbean Blacks and African Americans). The proposed dissertation embodies NIH's mission of promoting research activities that ""extend healthy life and reduces the burdens of illness"", and aligns with NCI's goal ""to accelerate progress in cancer prevention"" and ""to preempt cancer at every opportunity."" Investigating the social and financial factors that contribute to smoking at different stages of migration status can increase our understanding of the relationships between stress and smoking. Findings from this application can inform public health initiatives and shape tailored smoking cessation interventions. Additionally, findings from theorized differential relationships between perceived discrimination and smoking behaviors of Caribbean compared to African Americans can help guide future research and public health policies. This application will utilize cross-sectional data from the National Survey of American Life (NSAL). NSAL is a large scale study that examines the effects of social, structural, political and economic determinants of health of sub-groups of Blacks. Inverse probability statistical weights that address the multi-stage sampling design and over-sampling of minority racial and ethnic groups will be used in developing ordinary linear regression and logistic regression models. Finally, as smoking is the leading cause of cancer, findings from these analyses can inform future research on the high rates of cancer-related deaths among Blacks PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through my doctoral studies in the Society, Human Development and Health Department at the Harvard School of Public Health, I have been exposed to numerous research topics and given an analytic ""toolset"" to address health problems. This exposure has helped me refine my research interests, shape my career goals and form the development of this doctoral dissertation. My career goals are threefold. First, by conducting socially responsible and methodologically sound research, I seek to understand social experiences as determinants of the high cancer prevalence and mortality rates among minority and marginalized populations. Second, through clear, comprehensive and concise communication, I endeavor to increase the application of my research findings among the aforementioned communities. Third, I aspire to be a teacher to future generations of researchers. Several personal motivations and experiences underlie my career goals. My deep desire to understand the multidimensional social experiences of Black immigrants has been greatly shaped by the experiences of my family and me as immigrants to the U.S., 14 years ago. Furthermore, as a Black, female, immigrant, I have been exposed to differential treatment in various U.S. institutions, including education and healthcare, which have made me aware of my social status as a ""triple minority"".           ",Stress as a determinant of smoking among sub-populations of Blacks in the U.S.,7754519,F31CA142259,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Future Generations ', ' Financial Contribution ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Institution ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' High Prevalence ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Smoking Status ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human Development ', ' Chronic ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Research Activity ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Immigrant ', ' pressure ', ' Probability ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race Relations ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Societies ', ' English Language ', ' Life ', ' sound ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' African Caribbean ', ' black carib ', ' black Caribbean ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Weight ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' preempt ', ' Cigarette ', ' Prevention program ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Social status ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' social stress ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' migration ', ' protective effect ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' population health ', ' ']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,F31,2009,36178,0.13700468104737354
"Motivating Smokers with Mobility Impairments to Quit Smoking    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People with physical disabilities experience similar health disparities as other disadvantaged groups (e.g., no insurance, decreased access to medical and preventive care, more co-morbidities) but significantly less attention is paid to their health promotion. While smoking cessation interventions have been developed for other disadvantaged groups, none exist for people with physical disabilities. People with physical disabilities (mobility impairments) who use assistance to ambulate have higher smoking rates (32.5%) than people who have a disability and do not need assistance (23%) and people who are not disabled (19.8%; Brawarsky et al. 2002). The aims of the current study are to: 1) develop a series of theory-based intervention DVDs focused on motivating smoking cessation among people with mobility impairments (i.e., chronically use some type of assistance to walk such as walker, cane, wheelchair, braces, etc) and 2) test the efficacy of the Intervention DVDs vs. Print-based Standard Care among 560 smokers with mobility impairments in a randomized trial. The materials in both groups will be mailed on a monthly basis for four months, and are organized in separate sections according to readiness to quit. Participants in both groups will receive a) nicotine patches at no cost if they are ready to quit and b) brief phone calls (~5 minutes) between mailings to assess and encourage viewing the materials. We hypothesize that smokers who are randomized to receive the Intervention DVDs will be significantly more likely to achieve 7-day and 30-day point-prevalence abstinence at 1, 6, and 12- month follow-ups vs. those who receive Print-based Standard Care. The Intervention DVDs will be based on Behavioral Activation Theory, and address specific barriers to quitting in this population (increased stress, decreased positive affect, increased depressed mood, activity restriction, and self-efficacy). We hypothesize that the intervention will impact these mediators directly, as well as indirectly through Behavioral Activation (goal setting and pleasant events). Our series of preliminary studies support the use of these mediators for people with mobility impairments and the use of DVDs as an acceptable mode of intervention, given the economic and mobility limitations of this population. If effective, our DVD intervention could have a high level of public health and clinical significance, as it could be easily disseminated at low cost through national disability-related organizations, networks of independent living centers, or physician offices, and substantially improve the health and quality of life for people with physical disabilities. This study is innovative because no studies have targeted this population, it applies Behavioral Activation Theory to smoking cessation, and it examines relatively novel mediators in the field of smoking (e.g., positive affect, behavioral activation).

"Depressive Symptoms and Smoking in Middle-Aged and Older Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking research and intervention efforts have substantially neglected middle-aged and older adults, with older women who smoke particularly underserved. Yet, cigarette smoking is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among women in midlife and aging, and the hazards of smoking for women increase with age. Although adult smoking is maintained in significant part by nicotine addiction, important aspects of women's smoking in midlife and aging may involve psychosocial factors that are amenable to intervention. Depression in particular plays a significant role in maintaining adult smoking, although much less is known about the role of depression among older smokers. The greater prevalence of depression among women makes depression an important concern in women's health in midlife and aging. Although previous research has focused on clinical depression, increasing evidence indicates that sub-clinical levels of depressive symptoms, which are prevalent among women in midlife and aging, are also linked to smoking. However, the lack of a comprehensive model of social contextual and behavioral factors that affect smoking through depression or that mediate between depression and smoking hinders interventions to reduce smoking among women in later adulthood. The Surgeon General's report on women and smoking calls for longitudinal research on depression and smoking in women across the adult lifespan. This project will examine: (1) the relationship of depressive symptoms to smoking among middle-aged and older women, (2) the predictive role of social contextual and personal factors related to depression and smoking, and (3) demographic and health-related factors that make subgroups of women especially vulnerable to depression-related smoking. In this project we will conduct secondary analyses of data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Observational Study. The WHI Observational Study followed 93,676 women between the ages of 50 and 79 at enrollment for up to 8 years. The WHI Observational Study presents a unique opportunity to examine the link between depressive symptoms and smoking in a large diverse sample of postmenopausal women, with psychosocial and health-related data available at multiple time-points. Our research team will approach the study from complementary perspectives. This project is innovative in its unique focus on depression and smoking in middle-aged and older women, its use of the WHI Observational Sample to follow a socioeconomically and ethnically diverse sample longitudinally, and it's modeling of risk and protective factors in the depression-smoking relationship among women in this population. Consistent with Healthy People 2010 objectives to reduce adult smoking, this project will have a positive impact by providing a conceptual foundation for effective smoking reduction interventions with middle-aged and older women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cigarette smoking is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among women in midlife and aging. Reducing adult smoking is a central goal of Healthy People 2010.

"Faith Moves Mountains: A CBPR Appalachian Wellness & Cancer Prevention Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Appalachian communities are disproportionately affected by many of the leading risk factors associated with cancer incidence and mortality, factors amenable to primary and secondary prevention. Extensive involvement with our community partners has demonstrated strong community preference for a holistic approach toward cancer prevention; The proposed intervention extends our successful faith-based, trained lay health advisor tailored intervention, ""Faith Moves Mountains,"" (R01CA108696) initiated three years ago, to administer a culturally appropriate CBPR intervention. Working in partnership with 70 faith based institutions in rural Southeastern Kentucky, we propose to administer, evaluate, and disseminate a tailored wellness and cancer prevention program focused on four of the most common prevention activities that have the potential of greatly preventing and reducing cancer morbidity and mortality. These prevention activities include smoking cessation (targeting all chronic diseases, cervical and lung cancer); energy balance including dietary modification and physical activity promotion (targeting all chronic diseases and colorectal cancer (CRC)), and cancer screenings (targeting CRC, cervical, and breast cancer).      Consistent with our Faith Moves Mountains and cancer control approach, faith-based organizations will sponsor a ""kick off event"" or health fair in which participants will undergo a health risk appraisal (baseline). Participants will then select one or more wellness activities (smoking cessation, energy balance, cancer screening); then, trained lay health advisors will offer modules on each of these wellness activities. Smoking cessation will include the culturally relevant Cooper-Clayton method (outcome: smoking abstinence). For those targeting dietary modification and physical activity, a rural Appalachian modified Healthy Body/Healthy Spirit program will be administered (outcome: dietary change and physical activity participation). Tailored cancer screening promotion will be based on our current Faith Moves Mountains design (outcome: receipt of any recommended CRC screening test, Pap test for cervical cancer, and/or mammogram). To assess the intervention but remain consistent with community norms, we will employ a staggered intervention design. Throughout the project, the RE-AIM model will inform our evaluation. During phase three, this CBPR wellness approach to cancer prevention will undertake qualitative process evaluation interviews and disseminate the intervention to medically underserved Appalachian Ohio in collaboration with partners at Ohio State University. This collaboration will facilitate dissemination of successful intervention to additional rural Appalachian populations with high rates of cancer health disparities.           ",Faith Moves Mountains: A CBPR Appalachian Wellness & Cancer Prevention Program,7626248,R24MD002757,"['health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Secondary Cancer Prevention ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Fairs ', ' Health Risk Appraisals ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Cervical ', ' Phase ', ' Incidence ', ' Ensure ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Kentucky ', ' Trust ', ' Rural ', ' Fostering ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Mammogram ', ' Mammography ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Ohio ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rural Health ', ' Smoking ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Event ', ' preference ', ' cancer risk ', ' energy balance ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' holistic approach ', ' Prevention ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' Pap smear ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Dietary Modifications ', ' Diet Modification ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Communities ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' diet and exercise ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Abstinence ', ' NCMHD ', ' National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities ', ' medically underserved ', ' community based participatory research ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' successful intervention ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R24,2009,578187,0.015174484524118882
"Using CBPR to Implement Smoking Cessation in an Urban American Indian Community    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) have the highest smoking rates any ethnic group in the United States, at 41% versus 24% for African Americans and Whites. They also have the lowest quit rates of any group, at 8-10% at 6 months. Due to its long cultural significance as a sacred plant, the entirely negative portrayal of tobacco in most smoking cessation programs is inappropriate, leaving programs unsuccessful. In 2003, AI/AN patients from Haskell Health Center requested a culturally-appropriate smoking cessation program, causing the center director to contact the University of Kansas Medical Center Department of Preventive Medicine. Since that time, the larger AI/AN community in Kansas and Missouri has been working collaboratively with KUMC on the development of a culturally-tailored smoking cessation program, as well as several other projects. In 2006, KUMC and several community-based organizations formed the American Indian Health Research and Education Alliance, dedicated to improving the health of AI/AN using community-based participatory research methods. The culturally-tailored smoking cessation program that began the partnership, All Nations Breath of Life (ANBL), has now been developed and pilot tested and is ready for implementation in the urban AI/AN community of the Kansas City Metroplex. Our pilot data are promising; with a 25% quit rate and 80% participant retention at 6-months post-baseline. We will address the following specific aims: (1) To create appropriate infrastructure (personnel, space, supplies, leadership commitment) for the Heart of America Indian Center to serve as the primary site for implementation of ANBL; (2) To examine the acceptability and feasibility of implementing ANBL in an urban AI/AN community; (3) To estimate the effectiveness of ANBL in an urban AI/AN community; and (4) to identify factors that enhance dissemination of ANBL and contribute to program success or failure. We hypothesize that participants in ANBL will quit smoking at a higher rate than currently reported in the literature for the best available programs. In addition, we will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the program to help determine its sustainability. If this project is successful, ANBL can be disseminated to other AI/AN communities to help them quit smoking. By reducing smoking rates in this community, we can ultimately reduce their leading cause of cancer death (lung cancer) and their leading cause of overall death, cardiovascular disease.           ",Using CBPR to Implement Smoking Cessation in an Urban American Indian Community,7628360,R24MD002773,"['lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Maintenance ', ' Americas ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Missouri ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Native Americans ', ' Patients ', ' Plants ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' Smoker ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Medical center ', ' success ', ' intervention program ', ' Participant ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cause of Death ', ' County ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Native-Born ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Modeling ', ' Cities ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Adoption ', ' enhancing factor ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Kansas ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Leadership ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Literature ', ' living will ', ' Living Wills ', ' Logic ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' tobacco control ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' community living ', ' urban American Indian ', ' urban native american ', ' Outcome ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R24,2009,555848,0.2263235474721998
"CBPR to Reduce Tobacco Smoking among Residents of a Low-Income Urgan Setting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hugely disproportionate burden of death and disease borne by people of color and the poor is not a medical mystery, and its solution does not necessarily require high-tech interventions. Tobacco use is an excellent example because tobacco smoking is a substantial cause of death from five of the seven leading causes of death. Due to concerted public health efforts, smoking prevalence has been reduced by 30% over the last 15 years in the U.S. Yet not all have benefited equally in this great accomplishment. Most of our nation's educated and well-off individuals no longer smoke; the 21% of our adult population who continue to smoke are largely poor, undereducated, and underemployed.      The proposed R24 project ""CBPR to Reduce Tobacco Smoking among Residents of a Low-Income Urban Setting"" aims at reducing several health problems caused by or related to tobacco use among people of color and low-SES whites, through partnership with South West Baltimore community that will result in smoking cessation programs that are more effective and more culturally appropriate. Therefore, the specific aims for the proposed project are: (1) through CBPR and other rigorous scientific methods, develop, implement, and evaluate an intervention to reduce tobacco use that will be sensitive to the needs and characteristics of this community and produce a sustained reduction of tobacco smoking among 36% of the participants in the intervention; (2) to investigate specific marketing strategies that may affect consumption patterns; (3) to explore the ecological factors determining tobacco use and quitting behaviors in this community; and, (4) to implement information systems that will help the community track the scope and features of tobacco smoking, major risk and protective factors, in order to identify potential alternatives of action. The project is designed as Community Based Participatory Experimental Research, with mix quantitative and qualitative methods. Intense community involvement and active participation will be the core value of this proposed research. The effectiveness of interventions will be evaluated rigorously using individually tailored treatments with adaptive treatment strategies that use relatively new statistical approaches for effectiveness evaluations in community settings. ""Active"" and ""passive"" surveillance strategies will be used to analyze the scope, determinants, and dynamics of tobacco use in their community.          ",CBPR to Reduce Tobacco Smoking among Residents of a Low-Income Urgan Setting,7632056,R24MD002803,"['Evidence based intervention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' community setting ', ' effective intervention ', ' successful intervention ', ' treatment strategy ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' surveillance strategy ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Academia ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' informant ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' inducement ', ' Incentives ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Play ', ' Staging ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' instrument ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rights ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoke ', ' Social Marketing ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' Solutions ', ' Empirical Research ', ' programs ', ' Tobacco ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' Awareness ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' Cause of Death ', ' underemployed ', ' Underemployment ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' ']",NIMHD,MORGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2009,480079,0.2210544446969619
"Recruiting Latino Smokers via the Internet: The Feasibility of Online Advertising    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use is a major preventable cause of cancer and disease burden among Latinos in the U.S. The rapid growth of the Latino population means there will be an increase from 7 million to over 16 million Latino smokers by 2050 if smoking rates remain unchecked. Millions of Latino smokers are now using the Internet and web-based cessation programs have a growing evidence base of efficacy. Recruitment of Latino smokers to web-based cessation studies has been difficult and little is known about effective recruitment strategies. Research is needed to determine if web-based cessation programs work for Latinos, by what mechanisms, and at what cost. For this research to be possible, however, it is first necessary to identify theory-driven recruitment strategies that are cost efficient in reaching online Latino smokers. This mixed-method study aims to develop and test the effectiveness of online banner advertising in recruiting online Latino smokers to a free, bilingual smoking cessation website. In the qualitative phase of the project, expert input and consumer testing with Latino smokers will guide the development of four online banner ads. Ads will cross cultural targeting (surface vs. deep) with message framing (gain vs. loss frame) to determine the optimal communication strategy. The quantitative phase of the project will use a 4x4 Latin Square design to test the effectiveness of online ads with four outcome metrics: 1) the absolute number of clicks on an ad, 2) the clickthrough- rate to the smoking cessation website, 3) number of Latino registrants on the cessation site, and 4) cost per registrant. The hypotheses tested are that deep targeted ads will outperform surface targeted ads, holding constant message frame, and that gain framed messages will outperform loss framed messages, holding constant cultural targeting. We will also explore the potential interaction between message framing and cultural targeting, as well as the cost efficiency of ad delivery. Data from the present study will be used in a future R01 to recruit Latinos into a web-based cessation program to test the reach and efficacy of this cessation modality. This project will advance communication science by testing specific theories related to message framing and cultural targeting. This project will also add knowledge to the science of dissemination and help strengthen the dissemination of science using direct to consumer marketing and the Internet as a new channel to reach online Latino smokers. Results from this study will provide a transportable model for how to reach and recruit other racial/ethnic minority groups to web-based trials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Internet cessation programs hold great potential to reduce smoking prevalence and cancer disparities among the millions of online Latino smokers.

"Literacy and Smoking Risk Communications    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For over 90 million adults - nearly half of all adults in the United States - difficulty with health literacy interferes with the capacity to obtain, process, and understand health information. Moreover, these individuals have an increased risk of disease. Because tobacco smoking is the leading behavioral risk factor that contributes to social disparities in the incidence and mortality of disease, effectively providing low-literate smokers with information concerning the health consequences of smoking is critical. Therefore, the primary aim of the proposed study is to examine how health literacy influences responses to smoking risk messages manipulated in terms of message framing and emotionality. In addition to traditional questionnaires, outcomes will be assessed using ""implicit"" cognitive psychological measures. Thus, the proposed study examines the immediate effects of different types of smoking risk messages on cognition in a laboratory setting. Findings will have important implications for the future development of smoking cessation interventions targeted at low literacy populations. Smokers with varying levels of health literacy (i.e., inadequate, marginal, adequate) will listen to one of four different types of smoking risk messages recorded on a computer in the form of audio scripts (i.e., a human voice pre-recorded on a computer will read each message) and concurrently presented in written form via a computer monitor. They will be written at a fifth- to sixth-grade reading level and manipulated in terms of 1) framing (i.e., gain-framed messages that highlight the benefits of quitting vs. loss-framed messages that emphasize the costs of failing to quit), and 2) emotionality (i.e., primarily fact-based vs. primarily emotion-based). Framing and emotionality will be completely crossed to create four different types of messages, 1) factual gain-framed, 2) factual loss-framed, 3) emotional gain-framed, and 4) emotional loss-framed. The primary specific aims are to examine: 1) whether main effects emerge for health literacy (inadequate, marginal, adequate) and the different message types (fact-based vs. emotion-based and gain-framed vs. loss-framed) on the primary explicit and implicit outcome measures: a) intention to quit smoking, and b) implicit and explicit attitudes toward smoking, and 2) whether health literacy interacts with the different message types (fact- vs. emotion-based and gain- vs. loss- framed) to influence the primary explicit and implicit outcome measures: a) intention to quit smoking, and b) implicit and explicit attitudes toward smoking. A secondary, exploratory aim is to examine potential associations between explicit and implicit outcomes.

"A Multi-State Asian-Language Quitline for Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study addresses a significant gap in the implementation of effective tobacco cessation services as recommended by the Community Guide to Preventive Services. The Guide recommends telephone counseling, or ""quitlines,"" as a key population-based tobacco control strategy. Currently, all 50 U.S. states have established quitlines. However, only one quitline offers direct counseling in Asian languages. Justifications for the absence of Asian-language services range from the lack of proven protocols for this population to the practical difficulty of staffing a program in multiple Asian languages. The project will translate an experimentally validated, Asian-language, smoking cessation telephone counseling protocol into a multi-state quitline operation. State health departments in California, Hawaii and Colorado will work with the researchers who developed and tested the protocol to create a practical dissemination model. The project aims to demonstrate that collaboration between researchers and policy makers will help to translate research results quickly into real world public health practice. The project involves both dissemination and implementation and has two overlapping phases. In the first phase, researchers will work with three states that are ready to adopt an Asian quitline. Together they will: (1) evaluate the dissemination success of a multi-state model for an Asian quitline in which each state promotes the quitline individually, but a centralized operation provides the counseling service; (2) examine the natural variation in implementation of promotional strategies by comparing smokers' responses to advertising messages in the context of state-specific cessation policies; and (3) test implementation fidelity by comparing the number and length of counseling sessions with those in California's original Asian trial, and with those of participating states' English and Spanish quitlines. In the second phase, researchers will work with the health departments in other states to encourage further dissemination. Specifically, they will: (1) examine the organizational readiness of other state health departments to adopt either the multi-state Asian quitline or to start their own Asian quitlines, and to assess their change in readiness from year 1 to year 3; (2) conduct in-depth interviews with representatives from selected state health departments, state quitline operators, and community organizations to determine their perceptions of barriers to adoption of Asian-language quitlines; and (3) set in motion a process for further dissemination by recruiting at least one additional state to join the multi-state Asian quitline by year 3 of the project. The proposed multi-state quitline project, if implemented successfully, can serve as a model for other states in providing behavioral cessation services to Asian-language smokers, helping to reduce disparities in access to effective treatment for these populations.           NARRATIVE The proposed project aims to translate a proven telephone counseling protocol for Asian language smokers into a multi-state quitline operation. This multi-state quitline can serve as a model for all states in the provision of behavioral counseling services to Asian populations, helping to reduce the disparity in access to treatment by these populations.",A Multi-State Asian-Language Quitline for Smokers,7825957,R18DP002106,[''],NCCDPHP,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R18,2009,449357,0.07853072609539292
"En Pareja: A Latino couples intervention to help expectant fathers quit smoking    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking among Latino males living in the U.S. is a significant public health problem. Latinos smoke at the same rate as White males but are less likely than Whites to quit smoking, which can contribute to health disparities in life expectancy and increase mortality due to lung cancer. Clearly, smoking cessation programs for Latinos are needed. Some programs tested among Latinos have shown efficacy, but at the short-term only. Further, none has attempted to encourage cessation at a teachable moment: a time when cessation may seem more relevant. To reach this underserved population of smokers, we are proposing to conduct a teachable moment intervention trial for recently immigrated Latino smokers in Durham and Raleigh, North Carolina. We will conduct the interventions in Spanish. We will attempt to capitalize on the teachable moment of Latinas' pregnancy as an impetus for Latinos' cessation because pregnancy is a time when men might consider stopping smoking. Also, including the woman could help sustain cessation after the program is complete. Thus, we are intervening with Latino couples to help the men quit smoking. We have partnered with community leaders at El Centro Hispano, a community resource center for Latinos in Durham. We will develop an intervention based primarily on Social Cognitive Theory and the Teachable Moments Model. We will teach men smoking cessation skills, help improve men's self-efficacy and outcome expectancies for quitting, and teach the couples optimal ways to communicate to reduce the stress that comes with a new baby. With better communication, the couple may be able to work together better to help him quit smoking and stay quit. We are proposing to recruit pregnant Latino couples (n=420) into a two-arm smoking cessation intervention. The program will be culturally tailored to emphasize Latino cultural values that could contribute to higher cessation rates, namely familismo, a high value on the family, and personalismo, valuing warm personal relationships. The study arms are: Arm 1: Self-help smoking cessation guide vs. Arm 2: Couple-based smoking cessation counseling. We propose to survey couples face-to-face at five time-points: baseline, 28 weeks gestation, and 2, 6, and 12 months postpartum. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The smoking rate among Latino males is too high. Few effective programs reach and promote long term smoking cessation among Latino Spanish-speaking smokers. This intervention approaches Latinos when their wives are pregnant to increase motivation for quitting. The intervention includes Latinas and teaches the couples effective communication skills to help sustain cessation effects long term.           ",En Pareja: A Latino couples intervention to help expectant fathers quit smoking,7683058,R01CA127307,"['Counseling ', ' Couples ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Elements ', ' Emotions ', ' Address ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Language ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Individual ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Mexican ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Wife ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' North Carolina ', ' Couples Therapy ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Smoker ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Relapse ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' South American ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Upper arm ', ' Country ', ' self help ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' cultural values ', ' risk perception ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' volunteer ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' pregnant ', ' public health relevance ', ' intervention effect ', ' ']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,613495,0.16376482767247744
"Ethnic Health/Motivating HIV+ Latinos to Quit Smoking DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in the treatment of HIV disease have shown dramatic effects on improving immune function in a significant proportion of people infected with HIV in the US. For the first time since the beginning of the HIV epidemic, individuals with HIV are faced with the prospect of living longer, healthier lives. Cigarette smoking is highly prevalent among HIV+ individuals and, in addition to the negative health effects associated with smoking, poses unique health risks to those with HIV. Our research program is designed to improve the health and quality of life of HTV+ individuals and determine the most efficacious approaches to smoking cessation for diverse subpopulations of these patients. Building on results from our study of a brief motivational smoking cessation intervention among HIV+ smokers in Southern New England, the primary goal of this research program is to target the intervention specifically to Latino patients. Latinos make up 13% of the population, yet account for 18.5% of all AIDS cases reported through December 2002, making the Latino AIDS rate 4 times higher than that of non-Hispanic Whites.6 Research is limited in the area of HIV among Latinos and there are no studies to date that address the problem of tobacco use among HIV+ Latinos. We propose to address this disparity by focusing this research study on Latino men and women living with HIV/AIDS. Our goal is to develop and evaluate a clinic based culturally tailored smoking cessation treatment for a largely low-income, Latino, HIV+ population. We will compare this culturally sensitive intervention that incorporates a strong social support component to a standard care control condition, in a randomized controlled trial. We hypothesize that those Latinos receiving the Culturally Tailored Intervention will demonstrate greater biochemically verified smoking abstinence rates at 12- months post-baseline than those receiving a Standard Care Intervention control treatment. Hypotheses will be tested regarding the main effect of acculturation on smoking quit rates in the two treatment conditions. Critical information regarding how the intervention reaches patients and with whom it is most effective will be uncovered by examining mediators and moderators of the intervention-smoking cessation relationship. This study will be the first to examine different smoking cessation treatments in a Latino HIV+ population and the results will have implications for importing culturally sensitive and cost effective cessation treatments into clinical care settings.

"Exploring Cigarette Dependence among African-American Males in Barbershops.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of studies have suggested a link between stress and poor quit rates among African Americans. African-American men bear the greatest burden of tobacco-related causes of cancer. Thus, a major objective of the proposed pilot study is to explore what factors impact how adult African- American male smokers cope with stress. We hypothesize that cultural (e.g. goal-striving stress, spirituality, John Henryism) and gender-related (e.g. masculine gender role stress and male role norms) factors influence coping among urban adult African-American males and their nicotine dependence. We believe examining cultural and gender-related factors will contribute to further understanding of smoking behaviors, nicotine dependence and related health disparities among African-American men. Therefore, the specific aims for this study are to: 1) examine whether cultural specific cultural strategies influence nicotine dependence in adult AA male smokers, 2) explore whether cultural factors (e.g. John Henryism) influence tobacco dependence in adult AA male smokers, 3) examine whether gender- related factors (e.g. Male Role Norms) influence tobacco dependence in adult AA male smokers, 4) explore whether cultural factors influence coping efforts in response to stressors in adult AA male smokers, 5) investigate whether gender-related factors influence coping efforts in response to stressors in adult AA male smoker, 6) use qualitative methods to better understand these variables in the context of a pilot stress management intervention (R21) to reduce tobacco dependence in adult AA male smokers. The aims of this study will be carried out using both quantitative and qualitative methods. One hundred current or recent adult African-American male smokers and 100 adult African-American non smokers will be recruited from urban African-American barbershops in Richmond, VA. Participants will complete a self-administered survey. A sub-sample of the 200 survey participants (10 smokers and 10 non-smokers) will be recruited to participate in individual qualitative interviews. Base on the survey results, the qualitative interviews will be used to obtain in-depth data regarding gender-related and cultural factors related to stress, coping and smoking behaviors and nicotine addiction. Results of the proposed project will have applicability for better understanding smoking behaviors and nicotine dependence among adult African-American male smokers. Further, the results of this pilot study will serve as the bases for developing a pilot stress management intervention for adult African-American male smokers. We plan to test this pilot intervention through the R21 funding mechanism.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Project Narrative Despite having similar smoking rates as White men for the past 10 years, African-American men have the highest incidence and death rates from oral/pharynx, pancreatic, esophageal, and lung larynx cancers.

"Health Advocates as a Vehicle to Improve Treatment for Smokers in Public Housing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quitting smoking is the most important step that smokers can take to benefit their health. However, low-income smokers are less successful in quitting than higher-income smokers. If these socioeconomic disparities in smoking and smoking cessation rates persist, low-income smokers will bear an increasingly disparate burden of smoking-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, interventions to improve the rate of smoking cessation among low-income smokers are urgently needed. Smoking cessation treatment programs such as telephone quitlines and clinic-based programs exist but are underutilized, particularly by low-income smokers. We propose to conduct a group-randomized trial among public housing residents to test whether the use of resident Community Health Advocates with special training in smoking cessation (Tobacco Treatment Advocates (TTAs) can improve (1) utilization of quitlines and clinic-based programs and (2) smoking cessation rates among smokers in public housing. Twenty public housing developments (PHDs) in Boston will be randomly assigned to receive either the TTA intervention or enhanced standard care, with 250 smokers recruited for each condition. The intervention period for each participant will last 6 months, with final outcome assessment 6 months later. At intervention PHDs and TTAs will have 7-9 interactions with smokers to motivate them to use a treatment program, assist in determining which program best meets their needs, proactively connect smokers to programs, address logistical problems and other barriers to program participation, reinforce and augment counseling messages, encourage full utilization of programs including adherence to medication, and provide social support for quitting during and after treatment. Participants at control PHDs will meet once with a TTA who will provide them with culturally-appropriate self-help materials and information on smoking cessation services available through the Quitline and clinic-based programs. The primary outcomes for the study will be (1) utilization of Quitline or clinic-based cessation services (including dose of treatment), and (2) 7-and 30-day biochemically-verified smoking abstinence measured at 3, 7, and 12 months. Data sources for outcomes, as well as hypothesized mediators and moderators, will include quitline and clinic records, TTA records, and questionnaires administered at four time points. A cost-effectiveness evaluation of the cost per additional quit will provide information on the potential for disseminability.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Quitting smoking is the most important step that smokers can take to benefit their health, but low-income smokers are less successful in quitting than higher-income smokers.

"Case Management for Reaching and Treating Underserved Latino Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K01 Application is to provide Dr. Ana-Paula Cupertino with the necessary research skills and publication track record to launch an independent career focused on reducing tobacco-related health disparities between Latinos and the majority U.S. population. Career Development activities include formal training as well as mentored research experiences. Her proposed training will expand her research repertoire to qualitative methods, tobacco dependence research, models for behavior change, cultural tailoring, and clinical trial design. A publication timeline lists manuscripts she will complete over the course of the award. The Research Plan consists of three studies over five years and focuses on smoking cessation among Latinos in safety net clinics. Study 1 is a multi-method case study, conducted in 3 safety net clinics, that employs qualitative and quantitative research methods. It will provide rich descriptions of how tobacco is currently addressed in clinics and insight into how best to integrate a case management intervention into clinic practices. Study 2 is a randomized pilot study of a case management intervention for promoting smoking cessation among Latinos in safety net clinics. It employs a novel approach for identifying not only smokers in clinics but also other smokers at home. Smokers (N=90) will be randomized to either case management CM or control. Participants in both CM and control will receive educational flyers describing smoking cessation resources available in the community. Participants assigned to CM will also receive telephone-based case management to enhance utilization of cessation resources. Main outcomes include resource utilization (utilization of the state tobacco quitline and smoking cessation pharmacotherapy) and smoking cessation at 6 months. Study 3 consists of structured interviews with Study 2 participants and safety net clinic health care providers. The interviews will identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement for the case management approach. This research will support Dr. Cupertino's development of an R01 application to test this intervention.

"Ecological Monetary Assessment of Smoking Cessation in Spanish-Speaking Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My goal is to become an independent investigator focusing on health disparities research with a particular interest in smoking cessation among minority populations. The specific aim of this project is to examine the mechanisms underlying the process of smoking cessation and relapse among Spanish-speaking smokers, and how these mechanisms are influenced by factors such as education and acculturation. The proposed study will address these issues by examining real-time, momentary changes in affect, self-efficacy, expectancies, motivation, craving, stress, and social support in the natural environment. Participants will be Spanish-speaking community smokers (N=140) recruited from the greater Houston area. Participants will be tracked for 3 contiguous weeks (from a week prior to their quit date through two weeks after their quit date) using state-of-the-science ecological momentary assessment (EMA) procedures (Stone & Shiftman, 2002), All participants will receive smoking cessation treatment consisting of nicotine patch therapy, self-help materials, and in-person counseling based on the Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence Clinical Practice Guideline (Fiore et al., 2000).To the best of our knowledge, this study will be the first among Spanish speaking smokers to evaluate the potential mechanisms underlying smoking cessation using palmtop administered EMA procedures to assess transient and context dependent constructs associated with smoking. Moreover, there is less research on how social factors influence smoking cessation as compared to smoking prevalence, and in particular, on how these factors influence specific mechanisms that affect cessation. Thus, this study will contribute unique knowledge to the field. Other unique contributions of this project include the longitudinal investigation of acute momentary phenomena, repeated assessment of daily experience, and analyses of trajectories overtime (both pre- and post-cessation) in a population of Spanish speaking smokers. The aims of the study are to 1) Examine the intrapersonal and contextual determinants/antecedents (e.g., craving, affect, self-efficacy, expectancies, stress, coping behavior, and social support) of daily experience, temptations to smoke, and smoking lapses among Spanish-speaking smokers during a quit attempt; and 2) Examine the influence of education and acculturation on these mechanisms of smoking relapse.          ",Ecological Monetary Assessment of Smoking Cessation in Spanish-Speaking Smokers,7640815,K07CA121037,"['nicotine patch ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' Stress ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Investigation ', ' Dependence ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' self help ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Calculi ', ' Stone ', ' Biliary or Urinary Stones ', ' Participant ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' social ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' craving ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communities ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' Minority ', ' Expectancy ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' depression ', ' smoking relapse ', ' Coping Behavior ', ' Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Personal Digital Assistant ', ' Pocket Personal Computer ', ' Pocket PCs ', ' Personal Digital Assistant Computer ', ' Palmtop computer ', ' Palmtop ', ' Palm-top computer ', ' Palm-top ', ' Palm Pilot ', ' PDA Computer ', ' Blueberry Device ', ' BlackBerry Device ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Advertising ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Smoker ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K07,2009,120694,0.3013813899733984
"Effectiveness of Proactive Tobacco Treatment in Diverse Low Income Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a high prevalence of smoking and high burden of tobacco related disease among low income populations. Effective, evidenced-based smoking cessation treatments are available, but low-income and minority smokers are less likely than higher-income and white smokers to use these treatments, especially the most comprehensive forms that include a combination of pharmacotherapy and intensive behavioral counseling. In this application, we test a novel proactive outreach strategy, coupled with free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to increase the population impact of tobacco cessation treatment for diverse, low income smokers. Population impact is the product of treatment utilization (i.e., reach or exposure) and treatment efficacy (i.e., smoking abstinence rates among those who utilize treatment); therefore, the theory- driven approach will systematically offer low income smokers free and easy access to evidence-based treatment for tobacco dependence outside the traditional health care system. The intervention has two primary components: 1) proactive outreach to current smokers in the form of mailed invitation materials and telephone calls containing targeted health messages, and 2) facilitated access to free, comprehensive, evidence-based treatment for tobacco dependence in the form of NRT and intensive, telephone-based behavioral counseling. Our specific aims are to: 1) compare the effect of proactive outreach combined with free NRT and telephone counseling (PRO+NRT+TC) to usual care (UC) on population-level smoking abstinence rates among a diverse population of low income smokers, 2) compare the effect of PRO+NRT+TC to usual care UC on population-level tobacco treatment utilization rates, and 3) determine the cost-effectiveness of PRO+NRT+TC. This proposal will examine the effects of the intervention in a population-based sample (N=2500) of adult smokers enrolled in the Minnesota Health Care Programs (MHCP), a state-funded health insurance plan for low income persons. Baseline data will be obtained from MHCP administrative databases and a participant survey that will be conducted prior to randomization. Outcome data will be collected from a follow-up survey conducted 12 months after randomization and MHCP administrative data. The primary outcome is prolonged smoking abstinence (6 months) and will be assessed at the population level. All randomized individuals will be asked to complete the follow-up survey, regardless of whether they participated in tobacco treatment. Data analysis of the primary aims will follow intent-to-treat methodology. The study team has unique, relevant experience with tobacco treatment studies in diverse, low income populations, proactive outreach and telephone counseling. We will work in partnership with the North American Quitline Consortium to disseminate study findings. If effective, proactive tobacco treatment would reduce tobacco- related morbidity, mortality and health care costs for low income Americans.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a high prevalence of smoking and high burden of tobacco related disease among low income populations. There is a critical need to increase access to effective tobacco dependence treatments. We propose to rigorously evaluate the effects of proactive outreach coupled with free NRT and telephone counseling on the population impact of tobacco dependence treatment. If proven to be effective and cost- effective, national dissemination of proactive treatment approaches would reduce tobacco-related morbidity, mortality, and health care costs for low income Americans.           NARRATIVE There is a high prevalence of smoking and high burden of tobacco related disease among low income populations.

"The Effects of Neighborhood Characteristics on Smoking Cessation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco-related lung cancer is a leading cause of death among adults, and tobacco use accounts for -30% of cancer incidence and mortality. Therefore, eliminating tobacco uptake, increasing rates of tobacco cessation, and preventing smoking relapse are the cornerstones of cancer prevention. Moreover, a focus on groups disproportionately affected by tobacco use (e.g., minorities, low socioeconomic status (SES) groups, or populations at increased risk of relapse) is of clear importance in the fight against cancer. Previous research has shown that neighborhood-level SES is independently associated with higher smoking prevalence, but the role of the neighborhood in smoking outcome during a specific quit attempt has not been studied. The primary aim of this research is to examine how neighborhood characteristics influence the mechanisms underlying the process of smoking cessation and relapse prevention during a specific quit attempt among diverse community samples at increased risk for health disparities in cancer. Archival data will be examined from 4 study populations: Spanish speaking Hispanic smokers (n = 297), African-American smokers (n = 400), African-American, English speaking Hispanic, and Caucasian smokers in equal numbers (n = 420), and pregnant women who quit smoking and want to remain quit postpartum (n = 450). Specific aims of this project are to: i) Evaluate the relation between neighborhood characteristics (including neighborhood-level SES, racial/ethnic composition, neighborhood problems, vigilance, social cohesion, and social control) and smoking abstinence; 2) Evaluate the relation of stress, depression, negative affect, self-efficacy, and social support with neighborhood characteristics and with smoking abstinence, respectively; and 3) Evaluate whether self-efficacy, depression, negative affect, stress, and/or social support mediate an observed association between neighborhood characteristics and abstinence. In a series of 4 studies, I will use multilevel modeling to examine the pathways through which the neighborhood context influences cessation using both questionnaire and ecological momentary assessment data, as well as sophisticated geographical software to map neighborhood-level demographic and economic data. These efforts will result in a better understanding of disparities in smoking status among underserved populations and provide information important for improving service to individuals from those communities, thereby affecting public health.          ",The Effects of Neighborhood Characteristics on Smoking Cessation,7666723,K01DP001120,[''],NCCDPHP,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K01,2009,150000,0.16738885007835763
"The Impact of a Tobacco Control Intervention in African-American Families    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly 25 million US adults and 6.4 million children living today will die prematurely from tobacco-attributable diseases unless adults are successful with cessation and rates of child tobacco use are halted. Fifteen million US children <18 years old are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) mostly in their homes and parent modeling of smoking is identified as an important factor for the 4,000 children who initiate tobacco use each day. With widening gaps in health disparities for African Americans (AAs) related to the health effects of tobacco use, culturally sensitive approaches that may be effective need to be fully tested. Based on concepts from Social Cognitive Theory and taking a social ecological perspective, this research will investigate the effects of a family approach that includes child and parent/guardian (PIG) interventions on tobacco control. Subjects will include 4th grade AA children (N=400) and Ps/Gs; 50% rural and 50% inner-city. Using a two group design with repeated measures, schools (20) will be randomly assigned to treatment or control. Children and Ps/Gs in the treatment group will receive a yearly intervention for two years and the control group will receive matched contact and attention on general health education. The child intervention (Botvin's LifeSkills (BLS) consist of 8 classroom sessions taught during 4th and 5th grades (16 total sessions) by trained school personnel. The PIG intervention (BLS Parent) consists of 8 home-based modules during the 4th and 5th grades that promote PIG use of anti- tobacco socialization in the home and reinforce the school-based child intervention. Ps/Gs who smoke will also receive motivational interviewing and nicotine replacement therapy based on their readiness to quit. Behavioral change will be measured by self-report in children and Ps/Gs at baseline, 12 weeks (short-term) and 9 months (long-term) after each year of intervention (2) and also via salivary cotinine at three time points (baseline, at year 2 and at year 4). We propose this family approach will foster development of personal and environmental protective factors in children and their Ps/Gs for tobacco control. The primary hypotheses are: Children and Ps/ Gs in the treatment group will have improved behavioral outcomes of: 1) lower ETS exposure in children; 2) lower rates of tobacco experimentation in children; 3) higher PIG self-efficacy in delivering anti-tobacco socialization in the home; and 4) higher tobacco cessation rates in Ps/Gs. This research addresses a significant public health concern, tobacco use, which remains the single most preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. Consistent with both the NCI and the NICHD, this application targets the advancement of socio-cultural behavioral treatments for children and their families, the prevention of tobacco-related diseases, particularly cancer, and the elimination of health disparities among an ethnic minority group-AA. The need for theory-based effective interventions validated by biochemical measures is imperative for tobacco control. If effective, implementation of this family approach via the school systems as the primary point of entry is highly probable.           ",The Impact of a Tobacco Control Intervention in African-American Families,7626029,R01CA118066,"['Cotinine ', ' Scotine ', ' 2-Pyrrolidinone, 1-methyl-5-(3-pyridinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Indigenous ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Study Section ', ' Smoking Status ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Fire -

"A Social Ecological Based Smoking Cessation Intervention in Public Housing   African American (AA) women in urban, poverty-stricken neighborhoods have high rates of smoking, difficulties with quitting, and disproportionate tobacco related health disparities. AA women who smoke are twice as likely to die from cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer as other ethnic groups. Assisting this underserved population to quit smoking is a national health priority. Recommendations call for more comprehensive, participatory, and multi-level approaches that address social context (i.e., culture, social networks, and neighborhoods) in lifestyle behavioral interventions.  The broad, long-term objectives of this research are to optimize smoking cessation outcomes and to reduce associated health disparities in AA women who live in Southeastern US public housing neighborhoods. Using a participatory and social ecological approach, the academic investigators, advisory board, and public housing residents have developed a multi-level intervention (a.k.a. Sister to Sister) that has demonstrated feasibility and potential effectiveness in increasing short-term cessation outcomes. The primary aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of this bundled intervention on long-term (6- and 12-month) cessation outcomes in women in public housing neighborhoods.  We will pair-match 14 public housing neighborhoods and randomly assign one neighborhood in each pair (7 per condition) to either a treatment condition (Sister to Sister) or a control condition. We project 203 smokers for treatment and 203 smokers for control, a total of 406 participants (29 per neighborhood), will be required at baseline to detect proposed treatment effects for the primary outcome of smoking cessation. Treatment participants will receive the 24-week, bundled Sister to Sister Intervention consisting of: a) individual level strategies with 1:1 community health worker contact to enhance smoking cessation self-efficacy and spiritual well-being; b) interpersonal level strategies with behavioral counseling in small peer groups to enhance social support; c) neighborhood level strategies with policy and counter-marketing campaigns led by a neighborhood advisory board; and, d) an 8-week supply of nicotine patches and study-specific written cessation materials. Control participants will receive written cessation materials at baseline (Pathways to Freedom) and mailed written cessation materials at weeks 6, 12, and 18. In accordance with community preferences, the control participants will be offered a delayed intervention at the end of the study. Secondary aims are to test the effect of intervention mediators (self-efficacy, spiritual well-being, social support, cessation resources) and moderators (perceived stress, social influences, social ties, neighborhood cohesion, neighborhood smoking prevalence, neighborhood stress) on cessation outcomes. Measures will be assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Demonstrating success with this socio-cultural, multi-level approach may lead to wide-scale dissemination and adoption, and decrease disparities of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality in AA females.   African American women in public housing neighborhoods have high rates of smoking and difficulties in quitting.

"Sex, GABA and Nicotine: A 1H-MRS Study While there are several note-worthy differences between males and females with regard to smoking behavior, ultimately none are as worrisome as the disparity in ability to quit smoking. Although multiple explanations for why women are less successful in their abstinence attempts have been proffered, the observation that women are more likely to experience emergence of depressive symptoms during smoking cessation, a known risk factor for relapse, may be a critical contributor to this sex-specific recidivism. Several lines of evidence suggest that nicotine modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) may play an important role in this interplay between sex, depression and smoking recidivism. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), our group has found reductions in occipital cortex GABA concentrations in subjects with unipolar depression and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Recently, we have published pilot data from healthy smoking men and women indicating that nicotine induced alterations in cortical GABA levels are found solely in women and are characterized by reduced GABA levels in the follicular phase and abolished menstrual cyclicity in GABA levels. Reductions in cortical GABA levels in women who smoke may therefore render them at increased risk for depression, which sabotages their attempts to quit. Thus, we propose to employ 1H-MRS to measure GABA levels in the occipital cortex of a larger group of healthy smoking and nonsmoking women and men to confirm the impact of sex as well as menstrual cycle phase on nicotine-induced alterations in cortical GABA concentrations. In addition, women will be invited to undergo 10-14 days of abstinence using contingency management so that we may examine the relationship between baseline GABA and changes in GABA with abstinence and emergence of negative affect and craving. This project is both novel and timely as it responds directly to the mandate from NIDA to examine the impact of sex-specific factors on substance abuse/dependence disorders in order to enhance long-term abstinence.

"The Effects of Smoking and Expectancy on ERP Measures of Attentional Bias    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The focus of this proposal is to provide the applicant with the skills, experience, and mentoring to become an independent researcher with a focus on understanding the neurobehavioral determinants of nicotine dependence. The training plan outlined in this proposal will allow me to expand my skills by providing an opportunity to become proficient in the use of event-related potential (ERP) electroencephalography (EEC) techniques to study attentional and emotional mechanisms related to nicotine dependence. This work will be conducted at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, where I will be mentored by distinguished scientists in the field of nicotine dependence. This multidisciplinary team will provide oversight of my research and training experiences by providing specific expertise in the areas of neurobehavior, ERP, attentional biases, and gender differences of smoking. The focus of the Research Plan is to gain a greater understanding of the attentional biases of smokers in order to expand our knowledge of how drug and affective cues help to maintain neural sensitization to drugs of abuse. The proposed study would be the first to evaluate the attentional bias of smokers using a within-subjects balanced placebo design, allowing for the separation of the effects of nicotine from the effects of smoking cues on ERP attentional response to smoking and affective cues. The specific aims of this proposal are (a) to distinguish the effects of nicotine's pharmacological properties from those resulting from learned associations on the attentional distraction by smoking and affective cues in dependent smokers, (b) to determine whether gender differences exist in the attentional distraction by smoking and affective cues, (c) to determine whether the expectation of imminent tobacco use increases the attentional distraction by smoking and affective cues, and (d) to assess whether ERP measures of attentional distraction by smoking and affective cues correlate with traditional self-reported measures of nicotine dependence, craving, and affect.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Smoking dependence is thought to be maintained by the brain's attentional bias towards cues in the environment that remind the dependent invidual of smoking. This study will use event-related potential (ERP) EEG technology to investigate these attentional biases and circumstances that provoke them.           ",The Effects of Smoking and Expectancy on ERP Measures of Attentional Bias,7668570,K23DA024697,"['Cues ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Legal ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' distraction ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' trial design ', ' Cognitive ', ' University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center ', ' University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ', ' MDACC ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Female ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' career ', ' human subject ', ' Grant ', ' Area ', ' Peripheral Nervous System ', ' indexing ', ' Training ', ' Laboratories ', ' Stimulus ', ' Deception ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' event related potential ', ' Placebos ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' psychophysical ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Reaction Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Technology ', ' Scientist ', ' Association Learning ', ' Attention ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Dependence ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Digit structure ', ' Digit ', ' experience ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cigarette ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Cells ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' cue reactivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' neurobehavior ', ' Instruction ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Expectancy ', ' Affective ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' drug of abuse ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' drugs abused ', ' abused drugs ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' visual information ', ' information processing ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K23,2009,172181,0.19225013442872452
"Dissemination of a Smoking Quitline to the Underserved  Smoking is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States. Moreover, smoking is a critically significant behavioral risk factor that contributes to social disparities in the incidence and mortality of disease. That is, because the prevalence of smoking is higher among individuals with lower socioeconomic status, smoking has a substantial influence on socioeconomic disparities in health- related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, connecting underserved smokers with evidence-based tobacco cessation programs is crucial for disease prevention and the elimination of health disparities. Telephone- based counseling for smoking cessation delivered via quitlines has demonstrated considerable efficacy. However, quitlines are grossly underutilized. Referrals to quitlines generated in primary care settings are low, and a large majority of smokers referred to quitlines fail to contact the quitlines on their own for cessation assistance. Thus, the focus of this study is on increasing dissemination of an existing evidence- based smoking cessation program, the State of Texas Quitline (i.e., Quitline), which is provided by the American Cancer Society. The design of the study is a group-randomized trial that will be conducted in 10 community health clinics. Clinics are part of the Harris County Hospital District (HCHD) and provide care to a very large, racially/ethnically diverse, low socioeconomic status, underserved population of patients residing in the Houston metropolitan area. Clinics will be randomized to either an ""Ask-Advise-Connect"" or an ""Ask-Advise-Refer"" dissemination approach. Smoking status will be assessed and recorded in the electronic medical record (EMR) at every patient visit, and smokers will be connected (in the Ask-Advise- Connect condition) or referred (in the Ask-Advise-Refer control condition) to the Quitline through an automated link contained in the EMR. Smokers in the Ask-Advise-Connect condition will be called proactively by the Quitline, and smokers in the Ask-Advise-Refer condition will be encouraged to call the Quitline on their own. All smokers will be offered a series of proactive counseling calls during their initial call with the Quitline. The project will involve a close partnership and collaboration with the HCHD community health clinics. Outcome measures are based on the RE-AIM conceptual framework and are consistent with current dissemination research models. Primary outcomes include reach, efficacy, and impact of the dissemination approaches. Secondary outcomes include patient-reported fidelity as well as acceptance of and barriers to dissemination of the Quitline among clinic staff. The Ask-Advise-Connect approach to dissemination of an evidence-based tobacco cessation program could be easily maintained by the HCHD clinics and adopted by other health care settings. Thus, findings are likely to have a significant public health impact.

"The Influence of HIV Disease Events/Stages on Smoking Attitudes and Behaviors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While mortality attributable to AIDS-related diseases has decreased dramatically in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, the proportion of deaths attributable to other diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and cancer) has markedly increased. Thus, efforts to reduce morbidity and mortality attributable to these non-AIDS defining diseases represent an important public health priority. One approach to improve health outcomes for this population is to target health-risk behaviors, such as cigarette smoking. Existing evidence indicates that smoking prevalence is significantly elevated among persons living with HIV/AIDS. In addition, smoking is associated with numerous HIV-related adverse outcomes. Despite these findings, few efforts have been made to deliver cessation treatment to this population. Also lacking are efforts to explore the relationship between HIV disease events/stages and smoking. Thus, the overarching goal of this project is to prospectively explore the relationship between HIV disease events/stages, perceived impact of HIV, attitudes about smoking, and smoking behaviors. HIV disease events/stages (e.g., time of HIV diagnosis, progressive disease, and stable disease) will be evaluated as potential teachable moments for smoking cessation. Specifically, we will identify and recruit newly HIV-diagnosed smokers from a large, inner city HIV/AIDS care center serving a racially/ethnically diverse, medically indigent population. Participants will complete a computer-administered assessment designed to measure perceived impact of HIV, attitudes about smoking, and current smoking behavior at the time of study enrollment. In addition to traditional self-report measures, certain variables (e.g., perceived impact of HIV) will be assessed using ""implicit"" cognitive psychological measures, as considerable evidence suggests that both explicit and implicit measures yield unique information that predicts outcome. Participants will be followed for one year and asked to complete follow-up computer- administered assessments at three-month intervals. In addition to clinic administered assessments, participants will complete brief weekly phone assessments that will allow us to carefully track changes in perceived impact of disease and smoking behavior for the first three months of follow-up. Research staff will also conduct medical record reviews to document the timing and progression of disease (e.g., treatment failure, diagnosis of an HIV- or non-HIV related disease). This design will enable us to carefully track changes in smoking behavior over time, and to link these changes to both the course of HIV-disease and/or to participants' perceived impact of HIV. By identifying optimal time points for intervention, findings will have the potential to maximize the efficiency and efficacy of cessation treatments delivered in resource-limited settings. In addition, findings will be instrumental in identifying specific constructs that should be targeted for intervention, and will provide a strong foundation for the development of future cessation interventions targeting smokers living with HIV/AIDS.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed study will provide important information about the relationship between HIV-disease events/stages and smoking behavior among a low socio-economic status, racially/ethnically diverse population. Specifically, findings will identify potential teachable moments for cessation interventions in the course of HIV-disease, and will provide a strong foundation for the development of future cessation interventions targeting this population.          ",The Influence of HIV Disease Events/Stages on Smoking Attitudes and Behaviors,7644023,R01CA132636,"['Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Progressive Disease ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' AIDS Population ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Intention ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Learning ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Individual ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Medical Indigency ', ' medically indigent ', ' medical indigence ', ' Medical Indigencies ', ' Medical Records ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Staging ', ' Smoker ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Kaposi Sarcoma ', ' Multiple Hemorrhagic Sarcoma ', "" Kaposi's Sarcoma "", ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Controls ', ' Life ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Target Populations ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' Attitude ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior ', ' interest ', ' inner city ', ' cancer risk ', ' AIDS diagnosis ', ' Stable Disease ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Measures ', ' risk perception ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' response ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' HAART ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Cognition ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' attributable mortality ', ' attributable death ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' critical period ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' public health priorities ', ' Computers ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2009,319550,0.25208243851047335
"Using CBPR to Implement Smoking Cessation in an Urban American Indian Community    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) have the highest smoking rates any ethnic group in the United States, at 41% versus 24% for African Americans and Whites. They also have the lowest quit rates of any group, at 8-10% at 6 months. Due to its long cultural significance as a sacred plant, the entirely negative portrayal of tobacco in most smoking cessation programs is inappropriate, leaving programs unsuccessful. In 2003, AI/AN patients from Haskell Health Center requested a culturally-appropriate smoking cessation program, causing the center director to contact the University of Kansas Medical Center Department of Preventive Medicine. Since that time, the larger AI/AN community in Kansas and Missouri has been working collaboratively with KUMC on the development of a culturally-tailored smoking cessation program, as well as several other projects. In 2006, KUMC and several community-based organizations formed the American Indian Health Research and Education Alliance, dedicated to improving the health of AI/AN using community-based participatory research methods. The culturally-tailored smoking cessation program that began the partnership, All Nations Breath of Life (ANBL), has now been developed and pilot tested and is ready for implementation in the urban AI/AN community of the Kansas City Metroplex. Our pilot data are promising; with a 25% quit rate and 80% participant retention at 6-months post-baseline. We will address the following specific aims: (1) To create appropriate infrastructure (personnel, space, supplies, leadership commitment) for the Heart of America Indian Center to serve as the primary site for implementation of ANBL; (2) To examine the acceptability and feasibility of implementing ANBL in an urban AI/AN community; (3) To estimate the effectiveness of ANBL in an urban AI/AN community; and (4) to identify factors that enhance dissemination of ANBL and contribute to program success or failure. We hypothesize that participants in ANBL will quit smoking at a higher rate than currently reported in the literature for the best available programs. In addition, we will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the program to help determine its sustainability. If this project is successful, ANBL can be disseminated to other AI/AN communities to help them quit smoking. By reducing smoking rates in this community, we can ultimately reduce their leading cause of cancer death (lung cancer) and their leading cause of overall death, cardiovascular disease.

"Community-Partnered Tobacco Control in Underserved Dominican Republic Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The globalization of the tobacco epidemic poses significant morbidity and mortality burdens, with the brunt of impact increasingly borne by low-middle income countries. Research partnerships between investigators from high-income countries with well developed tobacco control research programs and their counterparts in low-middle income countries are needed to effectively address this global public health crisis. The Dominican Republic (DR) is a key site that mirrors the trends in Latin America: it is a low-middle income tobacco growing country with significant tobacco use and high levels of secondhand smoke exposure, and it is at a very early stage of tobacco control. The proposed project will assess baseline knowledge, attitudes, exposures, and behaviors regarding tobacco use and secondhand smoke, provide a randomized controlled trial of community-partnered interventions around secondhand smoke and tobacco cessation, and develop and implement a dissemination plan for national and regional impact and translation of methods and results to other underserved groups as appropriate. A multimethod assessment approach will be used, to include qualitative community assessments (RAPs), a series of quantitative surveys (household surveillances, community and smoker cohort surveys, and health care provider surveys), and a biomarker assessment of secondhand smoke exposure. Eight economically disadvantaged communities will be randomized to intervention or control conditions in a lagged treatment design; interventions will be developed and implemented based on the evidence base from other countries and from a current DR trial, and on input from national and local DR workgroups using a community partnered approach. The intervention is hypothesized to decrease tobacco use rates, increase the number of smokefree homes, denormalize smoking, increase awareness of and change attitudes regarding tobacco use and secondhand smoke risks, decrease exposure to secondhand smoke, and increase health care provider intervention in intervention- relative to control communities, with differences by geographic and demographic characteristics to be examined. The project will also engage international, national, and local DR workgroups to maintain communication of findings to key partners, host a national DR tobacco control conference with regional representation, and develop other action steps for local and regional dissemination of findings and evidence based interventions, resources, and infrastructures. Finally, the project will coordinate with the University of Rochester Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute for translation of current evidence based approaches and methodologies for implementation in the DR, and to explore whether any methodologies or interventions from the proposed trial in the DR can be translated to underserved groups in the United States. Effectively engaging early stage low-middle income countries in tobacco control research will be critical to reducing tobacco use and the burden of tobacco-caused illnesses globally. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tobacco use and tobacco-caused illnesses and death are increasing in developing countries globally, so it is critical to study these countries in order to effectively address the tobacco epidemic. The proposed project will test the effectiveness of community- based interventions for secondhand smoke and quitting smoking in eight underserved communities in the Dominican Republic.

"High Throughput Methods to Measure Disparities in Childhood Exposure to Tobacco    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Children are involuntarily exposed to tobacco both in utero through maternal smoking and during childhood from secondhand smoke (SHS). SHS exposure is associated with important health problems such as low birth- weight, asthma induction, asthma exacerbation, increased ear and lower respiratory infections, and sudden infant death syndrome. Notably, SHS exposure and the health effects of SHS vary by race, ethnicity and SES. Therefore, efforts to eliminate childhood exposure to SHS are critical for the reduction of health disparities. Because children have limited options for avoiding exposure, effective public health measures are needed to identify children at risk, increase parental smoking cessation, and implement home smoking restrictions, particularly with respect to minority households. An accurate, noninvasive method to objectively measure SHS would increase the nation's capacity to assess tobacco exposure risk in small children and minorities, who are often under-represented in research. Dried blood spots have been called a ""gold mine"" for assessing toxic exposures. They are obtained easily, and thousands of samples can be available to assess exposure levels across a population. Analysis of tobacco constituents in dried blood spots would afford an opportunity to objectively measure tobacco exposure on a population level. The goal of this project is to study disparities in childhood exposure to SHS by measuring cotinine, a biomarker of tobacco exposure. We propose to (1) develop high throughput liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) methods to quantify cotinine in dried blood spots; (2) estimate the U.S. population prevalence of in utero tobacco toxicant exposure by race by applying high throughput cotinine assay methods to extant dried blood spots collected during routine neonatal screening (n~2900); and (3) estimate the rate of SHS exposure in children ages 6-36 months by race by applying high throughput cotinine assay methods to extant dried blood spots collected to screen for lead exposure (n~3400). This application employs a multidisciplinary team with expertise in tobacco research (including the analytical methods to quantify nicotine metabolites), pediatric epidemiology, and health disparities research. The proposal is well-suited to the two-year ""GO"" grant mechanism because of the ability to rapidly access the important resource of extant dried blood spots from neonates and children that will yield thousands of individual samples. High throughput methods to measure cotinine in dried blood spots will provide opportunities to do all of the following: increase the reach of risk assessment into diverse communities, accurately measure SHS exposure, increase identification of childhood SHS exposure, move biomarker measurement of SHS exposure into the clinical arena, address tobacco-related health disparities, and inform changes in health care policy. The methods developed will provide an important resource to future epidemiological and clinical research initiatives that have potential to improve the health of children by reducing SHS exposure -- an important threat to public health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       This project will contribute to reducing disparities in health effects from tobacco among children. We will accomplish this goal by creating a powerful tool to objectively measure secondhand smoke exposure that is especially suited to use in young and minority populations and test the method in a large sample of dried blood spots from a diverse population of infants and children.           This project will contribute to reducing disparities in health effects from tobacco among children.

"A Multi-State Asian-Language Quitline for Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study addresses a significant gap in the implementation of effective tobacco cessation services as recommended by the Community Guide to Preventive Services. The Guide recommends telephone counseling, or ""quitlines,"" as a key population-based tobacco control strategy. Currently, all 50 U.S. states have established quitlines. However, only one quitline offers direct counseling in Asian languages. Justifications for the absence of Asian-language services range from the lack of proven protocols for this population to the practical difficulty of staffing a program in multiple Asian languages. The project will translate an experimentally validated, Asian-language, smoking cessation telephone counseling protocol into a multi-state quitline operation. State health departments in California, Hawaii and Colorado will work with the researchers who developed and tested the protocol to create a practical dissemination model. The project aims to demonstrate that collaboration between researchers and policy makers will help to translate research results quickly into real world public health practice. The project involves both dissemination and implementation and has two overlapping phases. In the first phase, researchers will work with three states that are ready to adopt an Asian quitline. Together they will: (1) evaluate the dissemination success of a multi-state model for an Asian quitline in which each state promotes the quitline individually, but a centralized operation provides the counseling service; (2) examine the natural variation in implementation of promotional strategies by comparing smokers' responses to advertising messages in the context of state-specific cessation policies; and (3) test implementation fidelity by comparing the number and length of counseling sessions with those in California's original Asian trial, and with those of participating states' English and Spanish quitlines. In the second phase, researchers will work with the health departments in other states to encourage further dissemination. Specifically, they will: (1) examine the organizational readiness of other state health departments to adopt either the multi-state Asian quitline or to start their own Asian quitlines, and to assess their change in readiness from year 1 to year 3; (2) conduct in-depth interviews with representatives from selected state health departments, state quitline operators, and community organizations to determine their perceptions of barriers to adoption of Asian-language quitlines; and (3) set in motion a process for further dissemination by recruiting at least one additional state to join the multi-state Asian quitline by year 3 of the project. The proposed multi-state quitline project, if implemented successfully, can serve as a model for other states in providing behavioral cessation services to Asian-language smokers, helping to reduce disparities in access to effective treatment for these populations.           NARRATIVE The proposed project aims to translate a proven telephone counseling protocol for Asian language smokers into a multi-state quitline operation. This multi-state quitline can serve as a model for all states in the provision of behavioral counseling services to Asian populations, helping to reduce the disparity in access to treatment by these populations.",A Multi-State Asian-Language Quitline for Smokers,7924181,R18DP002106,[''],NCCDPHP,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R18,2010,470092,0.07853072609539292
"The Impact of a Tobacco Control Intervention in African-American Families    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly 25 million US adults and 6.4 million children living today will die prematurely from tobacco-attributable diseases unless adults are successful with cessation and rates of child tobacco use are halted. Fifteen million US children <18 years old are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) mostly in their homes and parent modeling of smoking is identified as an important factor for the 4,000 children who initiate tobacco use each day. With widening gaps in health disparities for African Americans (AAs) related to the health effects of tobacco use, culturally sensitive approaches that may be effective need to be fully tested. Based on concepts from Social Cognitive Theory and taking a social ecological perspective, this research will investigate the effects of a family approach that includes child and parent/guardian (PIG) interventions on tobacco control. Subjects will include 4th grade AA children (N=400) and Ps/Gs; 50% rural and 50% inner-city. Using a two group design with repeated measures, schools (20) will be randomly assigned to treatment or control. Children and Ps/Gs in the treatment group will receive a yearly intervention for two years and the control group will receive matched contact and attention on general health education. The child intervention (Botvin's LifeSkills (BLS) consist of 8 classroom sessions taught during 4th and 5th grades (16 total sessions) by trained school personnel. The PIG intervention (BLS Parent) consists of 8 home-based modules during the 4th and 5th grades that promote PIG use of anti- tobacco socialization in the home and reinforce the school-based child intervention. Ps/Gs who smoke will also receive motivational interviewing and nicotine replacement therapy based on their readiness to quit. Behavioral change will be measured by self-report in children and Ps/Gs at baseline, 12 weeks (short-term) and 9 months (long-term) after each year of intervention (2) and also via salivary cotinine at three time points (baseline, at year 2 and at year 4). We propose this family approach will foster development of personal and environmental protective factors in children and their Ps/Gs for tobacco control. The primary hypotheses are: Children and Ps/ Gs in the treatment group will have improved behavioral outcomes of: 1) lower ETS exposure in children; 2) lower rates of tobacco experimentation in children; 3) higher PIG self-efficacy in delivering anti-tobacco socialization in the home; and 4) higher tobacco cessation rates in Ps/Gs. This research addresses a significant public health concern, tobacco use, which remains the single most preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. Consistent with both the NCI and the NICHD, this application targets the advancement of socio-cultural behavioral treatments for children and their families, the prevention of tobacco-related diseases, particularly cancer, and the elimination of health disparities among an ethnic minority group-AA. The need for theory-based effective interventions validated by biochemical measures is imperative for tobacco control. If effective, implementation of this family approach via the school systems as the primary point of entry is highly probable.           ",The Impact of a Tobacco Control Intervention in African-American Families,7845607,R01CA118066,"['Cotinine ', ' Scotine ', ' 2-Pyrrolidinone, 1-methyl-5-(3-pyridinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Indigenous ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Study Section ', ' Smoking Status ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Fire -

"Ecological Monetary Assessment of Smoking Cessation in Spanish-Speaking Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My goal is to become an independent investigator focusing on health disparities research with a particular interest in smoking cessation among minority populations. The specific aim of this project is to examine the mechanisms underlying the process of smoking cessation and relapse among Spanish-speaking smokers, and how these mechanisms are influenced by factors such as education and acculturation. The proposed study will address these issues by examining real-time, momentary changes in affect, self-efficacy, expectancies, motivation, craving, stress, and social support in the natural environment. Participants will be Spanish-speaking community smokers (N=140) recruited from the greater Houston area. Participants will be tracked for 3 contiguous weeks (from a week prior to their quit date through two weeks after their quit date) using state-of-the-science ecological momentary assessment (EMA) procedures (Stone & Shiftman, 2002), All participants will receive smoking cessation treatment consisting of nicotine patch therapy, self-help materials, and in-person counseling based on the Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence Clinical Practice Guideline (Fiore et al., 2000).To the best of our knowledge, this study will be the first among Spanish speaking smokers to evaluate the potential mechanisms underlying smoking cessation using palmtop administered EMA procedures to assess transient and context dependent constructs associated with smoking. Moreover, there is less research on how social factors influence smoking cessation as compared to smoking prevalence, and in particular, on how these factors influence specific mechanisms that affect cessation. Thus, this study will contribute unique knowledge to the field. Other unique contributions of this project include the longitudinal investigation of acute momentary phenomena, repeated assessment of daily experience, and analyses of trajectories overtime (both pre- and post-cessation) in a population of Spanish speaking smokers. The aims of the study are to 1) Examine the intrapersonal and contextual determinants/antecedents (e.g., craving, affect, self-efficacy, expectancies, stress, coping behavior, and social support) of daily experience, temptations to smoke, and smoking lapses among Spanish-speaking smokers during a quit attempt; and 2) Examine the influence of education and acculturation on these mechanisms of smoking relapse.          ",Ecological Monetary Assessment of Smoking Cessation in Spanish-Speaking Smokers,7842486,K07CA121037,"['Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Personal Digital Assistant ', ' Pocket Personal Computer ', ' Pocket PCs ', ' Personal Digital Assistant Computer ', ' Palmtop computer ', ' Palmtop ', ' Palm-top computer ', ' Palm-top ', ' Palm Pilot ', ' PDA Computer ', ' Blueberry Device ', ' BlackBerry Device ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Advertising ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Smoker ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' nicotine patch ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' Stress ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Investigation ', ' Dependence ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' self help ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Calculi ', ' Stone ', ' Biliary or Urinary Stones ', ' Participant ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' social ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' craving ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communities ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' Minority ', ' Expectancy ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' smoking relapse ', ' Coping Behavior ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K07,2010,123344,0.3013813899733984
"Race/Ethnicity, Menthol Cigarettes, and Biomarkers of Tobacco Use in the U.S.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main objective of this project is to evaluate the role of menthol cigarette use in explaining racial and ethnic differences in exposure to tobacco smoke components, among smokers in the United States (U.S.). Although Black smokers consume fewer cigarettes per day compared to White smokers, they have higher serum cotinine concentrations, are less likely to successfully quit smoking, and are at greater risk for some tobacco-related diseases. Several explanations have been proposed for these racial disparities, including differences in the prevalence of menthol cigarette use. Menthol has anesthetizing properties that could increase inhalation depth and tobacco intake per cigarette and it has been shown to impact nicotine metabolism, which may affect cotinine levels and nicotine dependency. In the proposed study, we will analyze the extensive smoking questionnaire and biomarker data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a series of nationally representative surveys of the U.S. population. We will combine five successive waves of data from the NHANES, conducted between 1999 and 2008. Serum cotinine, blood cadmium, and urine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are established biomarkers of tobacco use that are available in the NHANES database and will be used in the analysis. Serum cotinine is a specific biomarker of exposure to nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco. Cadmium and PAHs are highly toxic and carcinogenic tobacco components. While cotinine and PAHs reflect relatively recent exposure, cadmium can be used to characterize longer-term tobacco use. Using NHANES, we will describe the association of race/ethnicity and menthol cigarette use with biomarker concentrations using geometric mean ratios (and 95% CI) derived from regression models of log-transformed concentrations. In addition to crude analyses, models will be progressively adjusted for cigarettes smoked per day, sociodemographic characteristics, other smoking-related characteristics, and biomarker-specific determinants. Analyses will be conducted to account for the complex survey design structure and all estimates will be weighted to the U.S. population. This proposed research will utilize existing, publicly accessible data to examine racial/ethnic disparities in tobacco use biomarkers and the contribution of menthol cigarette use to these disparities. Examining differences in biomarkers of tobacco-related compounds will provide insight on the potential for menthol additives to contribute to nicotine addiction and long-term disease risk.        Project Narrative  Racial and ethnic differences have been reported in tobacco use, exposure, cessation, and disease risk. Menthol cigarette use has been proposed as one reason for these differences. The main objective of this project is to evaluate the role of menthol cigarette use in explaining racial and ethnic differences in smokers' exposure to chemicals in tobacco smoke.","Race/Ethnicity, Menthol Cigarettes, and Biomarkers of Tobacco Use in the U.S.",8009694,R03CA153959,"['Cotinine ', ' Scotine ', ' 2-Pyrrolidinone, 1-methyl-5-(3-pyridinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Intake ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Grant ', ' Series ', ' Chemicals ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Menthol ', ' Cyclohexanol, 5-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)- ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons ', ' polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Whole Blood ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Tobacco ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' United States ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Weight ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Complex ', ' Tobacco smoke ', ' Flavoring ', ' Flavoring Agents ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' meetings ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' American ', ' success ', ' authority ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Cigarette ', ' Structure ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Carcinogens ', ' oncogenic agent ', ' Oncogens ', ' Cancer Causing Agents ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Regulation ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Accounting ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' tobacco exposure ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' biomarker ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2010,81339,0.18744501913866915
"Sex, GABA and Nicotine: A 1H-MRS Study While there are several note-worthy differences between males and females with regard to smoking behavior, ultimately none are as worrisome as the disparity in ability to quit smoking. Although multiple explanations for why women are less successful in their abstinence attempts have been proffered, the observation that women are more likely to experience emergence of depressive symptoms during smoking cessation, a known risk factor for relapse, may be a critical contributor to this sex-specific recidivism. Several lines of evidence suggest that nicotine modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) may play an important role in this interplay between sex, depression and smoking recidivism. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), our group has found reductions in occipital cortex GABA concentrations in subjects with unipolar depression and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Recently, we have published pilot data from healthy smoking men and women indicating that nicotine induced alterations in cortical GABA levels are found solely in women and are characterized by reduced GABA levels in the follicular phase and abolished menstrual cyclicity in GABA levels. Reductions in cortical GABA levels in women who smoke may therefore render them at increased risk for depression, which sabotages their attempts to quit. Thus, we propose to employ 1H-MRS to measure GABA levels in the occipital cortex of a larger group of healthy smoking and nonsmoking women and men to confirm the impact of sex as well as menstrual cycle phase on nicotine-induced alterations in cortical GABA concentrations. In addition, women will be invited to undergo 10-14 days of abstinence using contingency management so that we may examine the relationship between baseline GABA and changes in GABA with abstinence and emergence of negative affect and craving. This project is both novel and timely as it responds directly to the mandate from NIDA to examine the impact of sex-specific factors on substance abuse/dependence disorders in order to enhance long-term abstinence.

"Exploring Cigarette Dependence among African-American Males in Barbershops.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of studies have suggested a link between stress and poor quit rates among African Americans. African-American men bear the greatest burden of tobacco-related causes of cancer. Thus, a major objective of the proposed pilot study is to explore what factors impact how adult African- American male smokers cope with stress. We hypothesize that cultural (e.g. goal-striving stress, spirituality, John Henryism) and gender-related (e.g. masculine gender role stress and male role norms) factors influence coping among urban adult African-American males and their nicotine dependence. We believe examining cultural and gender-related factors will contribute to further understanding of smoking behaviors, nicotine dependence and related health disparities among African-American men. Therefore, the specific aims for this study are to: 1) examine whether cultural specific cultural strategies influence nicotine dependence in adult AA male smokers, 2) explore whether cultural factors (e.g. John Henryism) influence tobacco dependence in adult AA male smokers, 3) examine whether gender- related factors (e.g. Male Role Norms) influence tobacco dependence in adult AA male smokers, 4) explore whether cultural factors influence coping efforts in response to stressors in adult AA male smokers, 5) investigate whether gender-related factors influence coping efforts in response to stressors in adult AA male smoker, 6) use qualitative methods to better understand these variables in the context of a pilot stress management intervention (R21) to reduce tobacco dependence in adult AA male smokers. The aims of this study will be carried out using both quantitative and qualitative methods. One hundred current or recent adult African-American male smokers and 100 adult African-American non smokers will be recruited from urban African-American barbershops in Richmond, VA. Participants will complete a self-administered survey. A sub-sample of the 200 survey participants (10 smokers and 10 non-smokers) will be recruited to participate in individual qualitative interviews. Base on the survey results, the qualitative interviews will be used to obtain in-depth data regarding gender-related and cultural factors related to stress, coping and smoking behaviors and nicotine addiction. Results of the proposed project will have applicability for better understanding smoking behaviors and nicotine dependence among adult African-American male smokers. Further, the results of this pilot study will serve as the bases for developing a pilot stress management intervention for adult African-American male smokers. We plan to test this pilot intervention through the R21 funding mechanism.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Project Narrative Despite having similar smoking rates as White men for the past 10 years, African-American men have the highest incidence and death rates from oral/pharynx, pancreatic, esophageal, and lung larynx cancers.

"Correlates of Nicotine Dependence among Urban African American Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities continue to exist between and within populations and little is known about the causes of population differences observed in tobacco use, nicotine dependence, and related diseases. More importantly, an age-race paradox exists in which African American youth consistently report lower prevalence of tobacco use than their Caucasian counterparts, yet African American adult smokers suffer a disproportionate burden of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. Nicotine dependence is the most formidable impediment to quitting smoking among adolescents. Despite the recognition of the central role of nicotine dependence in smoking cessation, there is a paucity of information about how nicotine dependence is expressed among youth who smoke. For these reasons, researchers have called for additional research to address the insufficient understanding of and gap in the literature on adolescent nicotine dependence and its impact on cessation. Thus, I describe a plan to examine critical factors of nicotine dependence among urban African American youth utilizing individual and group (class) trajectory analysis (Study 1) as well as mixed methods research, including a validated measure of nicotine dependence, focus groups, and in-depth interviews (Study 2) to elucidate the complexities of adolescent nicotine dependence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans bear the greatest burden of death and illness due to cigarette smoking. Most adults began smoking as adolescents and nicotine dependence is a critical barrier in quitting smoking. This Award will allow me to examine the nicotine dependence experiences of both adults and youth to better understand how we can help African American youth quit smoking.           PROJECT NARRATIVE: African Americans bear the greatest burden of death and illness due to cigarette smoking.

"The Influence of HIV Disease Events/Stages on Smoking Attitudes and Behaviors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While mortality attributable to AIDS-related diseases has decreased dramatically in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, the proportion of deaths attributable to other diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and cancer) has markedly increased. Thus, efforts to reduce morbidity and mortality attributable to these non-AIDS defining diseases represent an important public health priority. One approach to improve health outcomes for this population is to target health-risk behaviors, such as cigarette smoking. Existing evidence indicates that smoking prevalence is significantly elevated among persons living with HIV/AIDS. In addition, smoking is associated with numerous HIV-related adverse outcomes. Despite these findings, few efforts have been made to deliver cessation treatment to this population. Also lacking are efforts to explore the relationship between HIV disease events/stages and smoking. Thus, the overarching goal of this project is to prospectively explore the relationship between HIV disease events/stages, perceived impact of HIV, attitudes about smoking, and smoking behaviors. HIV disease events/stages (e.g., time of HIV diagnosis, progressive disease, and stable disease) will be evaluated as potential teachable moments for smoking cessation. Specifically, we will identify and recruit newly HIV-diagnosed smokers from a large, inner city HIV/AIDS care center serving a racially/ethnically diverse, medically indigent population. Participants will complete a computer-administered assessment designed to measure perceived impact of HIV, attitudes about smoking, and current smoking behavior at the time of study enrollment. In addition to traditional self-report measures, certain variables (e.g., perceived impact of HIV) will be assessed using ""implicit"" cognitive psychological measures, as considerable evidence suggests that both explicit and implicit measures yield unique information that predicts outcome. Participants will be followed for one year and asked to complete follow-up computer- administered assessments at three-month intervals. In addition to clinic administered assessments, participants will complete brief weekly phone assessments that will allow us to carefully track changes in perceived impact of disease and smoking behavior for the first three months of follow-up. Research staff will also conduct medical record reviews to document the timing and progression of disease (e.g., treatment failure, diagnosis of an HIV- or non-HIV related disease). This design will enable us to carefully track changes in smoking behavior over time, and to link these changes to both the course of HIV-disease and/or to participants' perceived impact of HIV. By identifying optimal time points for intervention, findings will have the potential to maximize the efficiency and efficacy of cessation treatments delivered in resource-limited settings. In addition, findings will be instrumental in identifying specific constructs that should be targeted for intervention, and will provide a strong foundation for the development of future cessation interventions targeting smokers living with HIV/AIDS.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed study will provide important information about the relationship between HIV-disease events/stages and smoking behavior among a low socio-economic status, racially/ethnically diverse population. Specifically, findings will identify potential teachable moments for cessation interventions in the course of HIV-disease, and will provide a strong foundation for the development of future cessation interventions targeting this population.          ",The Influence of HIV Disease Events/Stages on Smoking Attitudes and Behaviors,7847707,R01CA132636,"['Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Progressive Disease ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' AIDS Population ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Intention ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Learning ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Individual ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Medical Indigency ', ' medically indigent ', ' medical indigence ', ' Medical Indigencies ', ' Medical Records ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Staging ', ' Smoker ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Kaposi Sarcoma ', ' Multiple Hemorrhagic Sarcoma ', "" Kaposi's Sarcoma "", ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Controls ', ' Life ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Target Populations ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' Attitude ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior ', ' interest ', ' inner city ', ' cancer risk ', ' AIDS diagnosis ', ' Stable Disease ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Measures ', ' risk perception ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' response ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' HAART ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Cognition ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' attributable mortality ', ' attributable death ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' critical period ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' public health priorities ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Computers ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2010,319550,0.25208243851047335
"High Throughput Methods to Measure Disparities in Childhood Exposure to Tobacco    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Children are involuntarily exposed to tobacco both in utero through maternal smoking and during childhood from secondhand smoke (SHS). SHS exposure is associated with important health problems such as low birth- weight, asthma induction, asthma exacerbation, increased ear and lower respiratory infections, and sudden infant death syndrome. Notably, SHS exposure and the health effects of SHS vary by race, ethnicity and SES. Therefore, efforts to eliminate childhood exposure to SHS are critical for the reduction of health disparities. Because children have limited options for avoiding exposure, effective public health measures are needed to identify children at risk, increase parental smoking cessation, and implement home smoking restrictions, particularly with respect to minority households. An accurate, noninvasive method to objectively measure SHS would increase the nation's capacity to assess tobacco exposure risk in small children and minorities, who are often under-represented in research. Dried blood spots have been called a ""gold mine"" for assessing toxic exposures. They are obtained easily, and thousands of samples can be available to assess exposure levels across a population. Analysis of tobacco constituents in dried blood spots would afford an opportunity to objectively measure tobacco exposure on a population level. The goal of this project is to study disparities in childhood exposure to SHS by measuring cotinine, a biomarker of tobacco exposure. We propose to (1) develop high throughput liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) methods to quantify cotinine in dried blood spots; (2) estimate the U.S. population prevalence of in utero tobacco toxicant exposure by race by applying high throughput cotinine assay methods to extant dried blood spots collected during routine neonatal screening (n~2900); and (3) estimate the rate of SHS exposure in children ages 6-36 months by race by applying high throughput cotinine assay methods to extant dried blood spots collected to screen for lead exposure (n~3400). This application employs a multidisciplinary team with expertise in tobacco research (including the analytical methods to quantify nicotine metabolites), pediatric epidemiology, and health disparities research. The proposal is well-suited to the two-year ""GO"" grant mechanism because of the ability to rapidly access the important resource of extant dried blood spots from neonates and children that will yield thousands of individual samples. High throughput methods to measure cotinine in dried blood spots will provide opportunities to do all of the following: increase the reach of risk assessment into diverse communities, accurately measure SHS exposure, increase identification of childhood SHS exposure, move biomarker measurement of SHS exposure into the clinical arena, address tobacco-related health disparities, and inform changes in health care policy. The methods developed will provide an important resource to future epidemiological and clinical research initiatives that have potential to improve the health of children by reducing SHS exposure -- an important threat to public health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       This project will contribute to reducing disparities in health effects from tobacco among children. We will accomplish this goal by creating a powerful tool to objectively measure secondhand smoke exposure that is especially suited to use in young and minority populations and test the method in a large sample of dried blood spots from a diverse population of infants and children.           This project will contribute to reducing disparities in health effects from tobacco among children.

"Effectiveness of Proactive Tobacco Treatment in Diverse Low Income Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a high prevalence of smoking and high burden of tobacco related disease among low income populations. Effective, evidenced-based smoking cessation treatments are available, but low-income and minority smokers are less likely than higher-income and white smokers to use these treatments, especially the most comprehensive forms that include a combination of pharmacotherapy and intensive behavioral counseling. In this application, we test a novel proactive outreach strategy, coupled with free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to increase the population impact of tobacco cessation treatment for diverse, low income smokers. Population impact is the product of treatment utilization (i.e., reach or exposure) and treatment efficacy (i.e., smoking abstinence rates among those who utilize treatment); therefore, the theory- driven approach will systematically offer low income smokers free and easy access to evidence-based treatment for tobacco dependence outside the traditional health care system. The intervention has two primary components: 1) proactive outreach to current smokers in the form of mailed invitation materials and telephone calls containing targeted health messages, and 2) facilitated access to free, comprehensive, evidence-based treatment for tobacco dependence in the form of NRT and intensive, telephone-based behavioral counseling. Our specific aims are to: 1) compare the effect of proactive outreach combined with free NRT and telephone counseling (PRO+NRT+TC) to usual care (UC) on population-level smoking abstinence rates among a diverse population of low income smokers, 2) compare the effect of PRO+NRT+TC to usual care UC on population-level tobacco treatment utilization rates, and 3) determine the cost-effectiveness of PRO+NRT+TC. This proposal will examine the effects of the intervention in a population-based sample (N=2500) of adult smokers enrolled in the Minnesota Health Care Programs (MHCP), a state-funded health insurance plan for low income persons. Baseline data will be obtained from MHCP administrative databases and a participant survey that will be conducted prior to randomization. Outcome data will be collected from a follow-up survey conducted 12 months after randomization and MHCP administrative data. The primary outcome is prolonged smoking abstinence (6 months) and will be assessed at the population level. All randomized individuals will be asked to complete the follow-up survey, regardless of whether they participated in tobacco treatment. Data analysis of the primary aims will follow intent-to-treat methodology. The study team has unique, relevant experience with tobacco treatment studies in diverse, low income populations, proactive outreach and telephone counseling. We will work in partnership with the North American Quitline Consortium to disseminate study findings. If effective, proactive tobacco treatment would reduce tobacco- related morbidity, mortality and health care costs for low income Americans.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a high prevalence of smoking and high burden of tobacco related disease among low income populations. There is a critical need to increase access to effective tobacco dependence treatments. We propose to rigorously evaluate the effects of proactive outreach coupled with free NRT and telephone counseling on the population impact of tobacco dependence treatment. If proven to be effective and cost- effective, national dissemination of proactive treatment approaches would reduce tobacco-related morbidity, mortality, and health care costs for low income Americans.           NARRATIVE There is a high prevalence of smoking and high burden of tobacco related disease among low income populations.

"Health Advocates as a Vehicle to Improve Treatment for Smokers in Public Housing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quitting smoking is the most important step that smokers can take to benefit their health. However, low-income smokers are less successful in quitting than higher-income smokers. If these socioeconomic disparities in smoking and smoking cessation rates persist, low-income smokers will bear an increasingly disparate burden of smoking-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, interventions to improve the rate of smoking cessation among low-income smokers are urgently needed. Smoking cessation treatment programs such as telephone quitlines and clinic-based programs exist but are underutilized, particularly by low-income smokers. We propose to conduct a group-randomized trial among public housing residents to test whether the use of resident Community Health Advocates with special training in smoking cessation (Tobacco Treatment Advocates (TTAs) can improve (1) utilization of quitlines and clinic-based programs and (2) smoking cessation rates among smokers in public housing. Twenty public housing developments (PHDs) in Boston will be randomly assigned to receive either the TTA intervention or enhanced standard care, with 250 smokers recruited for each condition. The intervention period for each participant will last 6 months, with final outcome assessment 6 months later. At intervention PHDs and TTAs will have 7-9 interactions with smokers to motivate them to use a treatment program, assist in determining which program best meets their needs, proactively connect smokers to programs, address logistical problems and other barriers to program participation, reinforce and augment counseling messages, encourage full utilization of programs including adherence to medication, and provide social support for quitting during and after treatment. Participants at control PHDs will meet once with a TTA who will provide them with culturally-appropriate self-help materials and information on smoking cessation services available through the Quitline and clinic-based programs. The primary outcomes for the study will be (1) utilization of Quitline or clinic-based cessation services (including dose of treatment), and (2) 7-and 30-day biochemically-verified smoking abstinence measured at 3, 7, and 12 months. Data sources for outcomes, as well as hypothesized mediators and moderators, will include quitline and clinic records, TTA records, and questionnaires administered at four time points. A cost-effectiveness evaluation of the cost per additional quit will provide information on the potential for disseminability.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Quitting smoking is the most important step that smokers can take to benefit their health, but low-income smokers are less successful in quitting than higher-income smokers.

"The Effects of Smoking and Expectancy on ERP Measures of Attentional Bias    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The focus of this proposal is to provide the applicant with the skills, experience, and mentoring to become an independent researcher with a focus on understanding the neurobehavioral determinants of nicotine dependence. The training plan outlined in this proposal will allow me to expand my skills by providing an opportunity to become proficient in the use of event-related potential (ERP) electroencephalography (EEC) techniques to study attentional and emotional mechanisms related to nicotine dependence. This work will be conducted at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, where I will be mentored by distinguished scientists in the field of nicotine dependence. This multidisciplinary team will provide oversight of my research and training experiences by providing specific expertise in the areas of neurobehavior, ERP, attentional biases, and gender differences of smoking. The focus of the Research Plan is to gain a greater understanding of the attentional biases of smokers in order to expand our knowledge of how drug and affective cues help to maintain neural sensitization to drugs of abuse. The proposed study would be the first to evaluate the attentional bias of smokers using a within-subjects balanced placebo design, allowing for the separation of the effects of nicotine from the effects of smoking cues on ERP attentional response to smoking and affective cues. The specific aims of this proposal are (a) to distinguish the effects of nicotine's pharmacological properties from those resulting from learned associations on the attentional distraction by smoking and affective cues in dependent smokers, (b) to determine whether gender differences exist in the attentional distraction by smoking and affective cues, (c) to determine whether the expectation of imminent tobacco use increases the attentional distraction by smoking and affective cues, and (d) to assess whether ERP measures of attentional distraction by smoking and affective cues correlate with traditional self-reported measures of nicotine dependence, craving, and affect.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Smoking dependence is thought to be maintained by the brain's attentional bias towards cues in the environment that remind the dependent invidual of smoking. This study will use event-related potential (ERP) EEG technology to investigate these attentional biases and circumstances that provoke them.           ",The Effects of Smoking and Expectancy on ERP Measures of Attentional Bias,7849072,K23DA024697,"['Cues ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Legal ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' distraction ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' trial design ', ' Cognitive ', ' University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center ', ' University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ', ' MDACC ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Female ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' career ', ' human subject ', ' Grant ', ' Area ', ' Peripheral Nervous System ', ' indexing ', ' Training ', ' Laboratories ', ' Stimulus ', ' Deception ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' event related potential ', ' Placebos ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' psychophysical ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Reaction Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Technology ', ' Scientist ', ' Association Learning ', ' Attention ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Dependence ', ' Slide ', ' Techniques ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Cells ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' cue reactivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' neurobehavior ', ' Instruction ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Expectancy ', ' Affective ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' drug of abuse ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' drugs abused ', ' abused drugs ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' visual information ', ' information processing ', ' public health relevance ', ' Digit structure ', ' Digit ', ' experience ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cigarette ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K23,2010,175727,0.19225013442872452
"Smoking Cessation Interventions and Program Availability for Drug and Alcohol Add    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of smoking among individuals seeking treatment for a co-occurring substance abuse condition is very high, between 70%-95% (Burling & Ziff, 1988; Fiore et al., 2000; Kozlowski et al., 1986; McCarthy et al., 2002). However, many drug treatment facilities do not encourage smoking cessation during treatment, even though patients are often show interest in quitting smoking. Research finds that not only are low income people more likely to smoke, but the resources for smoking cessation may not be as accessible as those who have higher income (Novotny & Giovino, 1998; MMRW, November 9, 2007; Barbeau et al., 2004; Honjo et al., 2006). Therefore, substance abuse treatment is a context where evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for smoking might have the best chance of reaching low-income smokers. Treating patient smoking concurrent with other drugs is important since research demonstrates that addiction to nicotine may cause changes in brain chemistry and structure which could trigger drug and alcohol cravings, decreasing the chance of prolonged sobriety (Britt & McGehee, 2008; Yeh et al., 2007). The proposed project pursues two objectives related to understanding the adoption, implementation, and sustainability (or conversely discontinuation) of EBTs for smoking in substance abuse treatment contexts. The first aim examines longitudinally the availability of EBTs for smoking among those seeking treatment for co-occurring substance abuse and explores the predictors of changes in service availability over time in treatment programs. Key categories of predictors include the percentage of low-income clients served by the treatment center, organizational and policy factors, and workforce characteristics. The second aim also uses a longitudinal design to examine the evidence-based clinical practice behaviors that counselors engage in with clients. This is important because individuals implement EBTs not organizations or treatment programs (Fixsen et al., 1995). Integrating theory and research from implementation science, public health, organizational change, substance abuse treatment, and health services delivery four categories of moderator variables are examined to understand why and under what conditions counselors are likely to engage clients in smoking cessation efforts with clients.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health-related risks of smoking make it a major public health concern, particularly in light of recent research suggesting that the addictive properties of nicotine are similar to that of opiates. There are also health disparities in both smoking behavior and smoking treatment as a function of socio-economic status and race/ethnicity. Many low-income people also lack access to high quality medical care (Warnecke et al., 2008) and are over-represented in substance abuse treatment contexts. By focusing on the availability, implementation, and sustainability of evidence-based treatments for smoking in the context of substance abuse treatment the proposed application has clear public health (including public health policy) relevance.           The health-related risks of smoking make it a major public health concern, particularly in light of recent research suggesting that the addictive properties of nicotine are similar to that of opiates.

"Treatment modality and socioeconomic status in treating tobacco dependence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lower socioeconomic status (SES) and rural groups are overrepresented among smokers and suffer disproportionately from tobacco-related diseases. Arkansas has a high proportion of lower SES and rural residents and one of the highest rates of smoking in the nation. Through the Arkansas Department of Health, the state offered a free, statewide, intensive, evidence-based tobacco dependence treatment program delivered in two modalities: over the telephone and in person. Extensive clinical, demographic, SES-related, and outcome data were collected on approximately12,000 smokers seeking treatment. Data from this treatment program provide unique opportunities to clinically and demographically describe and compare treatment outcomes as a function of treatment modality, independent of treatment content, and to identify factors that predict success for each modality in this primarily lower SES sample. Factors that predict success in quitting for lower SES groups may differ by modality, as well as from factors that generally predict success for higher SES groups. In the proposed study, we will analyze existing data from this tobacco dependence treatment program, pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Describe and compare the demographic and clinical characteristics of tobacco users who elect telephone versus in-person treatment, using descriptive statistics and significance testing; (2) compare treatment utilization and treatment exposure for telephone and in-person modalities, using descriptive statistics and significance testing; (3) compare treatment outcomes for telephone and in-person modalities, using logistic regression and generalized estimating equations modeling; and (4) compare treatment outcomes as a function of traditional demographic and clinical predictor variables, as well as other SES-related contextual factors such as support from work and health care providers, using logistic regression modeling. Congruent with the goals and recommendations of the NCI Tobacco Control Research Branch and the Clinical Practice Guideline, this study will (1) describe variations in treatment based on sociocultural factors including novel information (a) on a community-based sample of tobacco users who access treatment and (b) about treatment utilization and outcomes relative to SES-related variables; the study will also (2) generate new information about applying, promoting, and disseminating evidence-based interventions in clinical and public health practice and contribute to tobacco control policy development. This study is especially important and timely given that the current population of smokers in the U.S. comprises largely lower SES groups, that 25% of the U.S. population resides in rural areas, that all 50 states now provide some form of publicly funded tobacco cessation assistance through quit lines, and that there is a dearth of information about the impact of sociocultural and clinical factors in publicly funded programs relative to treatment utilization and outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       PROJECT NARRATIVE Socioeconomic status (SES) clearly plays a significant role in tobacco use and the outcomes of tobacco dependence treatment, although we do not yet understand how the various factors involved, including education and income levels, exert their influence. In view of the largely lower SES of the current population of smokers in the U.S., the considerable size (25%) of the U.S. rural population, the provision by all 50 states of some form of publicly funded tobacco cessation assistance through quitlines, and the dearth of information about the impact of sociocultural and clinical factors in publicly funded treatment programs, the proposed study will examine the characteristics of participants in a statewide, six-session, evidence-based tobacco dependence treatment program delivered in two different treatment modalities: over the telephone and in person. The information to be gained from the analysis of this treatment program will help understand, address, and eventually eliminate disparities in tobacco use and in the outcomes of tobacco dependence treatment.            PROJECT NARRATIVE Socioeconomic status (SES) clearly plays a significant role in tobacco use and the outcomes of tobacco dependence treatment, although we do not yet understand how the various factors involved, including education and income levels, exert their influence.

"Optimizing Treatment for Brazilian Smokers through Community-Based Primary Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  By 2030, over 8 million people will die annually from tobacco, and 80% of these deaths will occur in developing countries. Many countries are attempting to contravene this trend by becoming signatories to the World Health Organization's international tobacco treaty-the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). Helping smokers quit is a core article of the FCTC. Although Brazil provides universal coverage for evidence-based tobacco treatments, it continues to have disparities in tobacco prevalence and access to treatment. The twofold purpose of this project is to 1) conduct a research project to understand and enhance access to tobacco treatment for Brazilian smokers, and 2) build a research collaboration between the U.S. and Brazil. The research project involves collaborating with community-based primary care clinics in Juiz de Fora, Brazil to achieve the following specific aims: 1) create a representative registry of smokers to determine tobacco prevalence and attitudes toward treatment; 2) describe health care provider perspectives on how best to reach low-income smokers; 3) develop and pilot test a community agent intervention to enhance access to tobacco treatment services. The Parent R01 for this project tests the effectiveness of telemedicine to increase access to evidence-based tobacco treatment among rural Anglo and Latino smokers in the U.S. through rural primary care facilities. The project also relies on a K-Award that tests the effects of a U.S.-based lay health worker intervention designed to increase access to tobacco treatment among unban Latinos. The project utilizes the multiple-P.I. mechanism to take advantage of the complementary strengths of the Principal Investigators of these projects. The project will be conducted in collaboration with Brazilian P.I. Dr. Oscarina da Silva Ezequiel and her staff at the Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora (UFJF). Research capacity building activities include formal course offerings, mentored research projects, and community lectures designed to build knowledge and skills for conducting applied clinical research. The project addresses a significant global health problem and it is a highly relevant project for Brazil, which has a large population of very poor smokers. It also capitalizes on the unique structure of the Brazilian health care system to identify and link every smoker in the population to existing services. As such, it represents a paradigm shift from reactive to proactive treatment. Research project findings will be used to support an application for a large scale, definitive trial of the pilot intervention.

"Community-Partnered Tobacco Control in Underserved Dominican Republic Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The globalization of the tobacco epidemic poses significant morbidity and mortality burdens, with the brunt of impact increasingly borne by low-middle income countries. Research partnerships between investigators from high-income countries with well developed tobacco control research programs and their counterparts in low-middle income countries are needed to effectively address this global public health crisis. The Dominican Republic (DR) is a key site that mirrors the trends in Latin America: it is a low-middle income tobacco growing country with significant tobacco use and high levels of secondhand smoke exposure, and it is at a very early stage of tobacco control. The proposed project will assess baseline knowledge, attitudes, exposures, and behaviors regarding tobacco use and secondhand smoke, provide a randomized controlled trial of community-partnered interventions around secondhand smoke and tobacco cessation, and develop and implement a dissemination plan for national and regional impact and translation of methods and results to other underserved groups as appropriate. A multimethod assessment approach will be used, to include qualitative community assessments (RAPs), a series of quantitative surveys (household surveillances, community and smoker cohort surveys, and health care provider surveys), and a biomarker assessment of secondhand smoke exposure. Eight economically disadvantaged communities will be randomized to intervention or control conditions in a lagged treatment design; interventions will be developed and implemented based on the evidence base from other countries and from a current DR trial, and on input from national and local DR workgroups using a community partnered approach. The intervention is hypothesized to decrease tobacco use rates, increase the number of smokefree homes, denormalize smoking, increase awareness of and change attitudes regarding tobacco use and secondhand smoke risks, decrease exposure to secondhand smoke, and increase health care provider intervention in intervention- relative to control communities, with differences by geographic and demographic characteristics to be examined. The project will also engage international, national, and local DR workgroups to maintain communication of findings to key partners, host a national DR tobacco control conference with regional representation, and develop other action steps for local and regional dissemination of findings and evidence based interventions, resources, and infrastructures. Finally, the project will coordinate with the University of Rochester Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute for translation of current evidence based approaches and methodologies for implementation in the DR, and to explore whether any methodologies or interventions from the proposed trial in the DR can be translated to underserved groups in the United States. Effectively engaging early stage low-middle income countries in tobacco control research will be critical to reducing tobacco use and the burden of tobacco-caused illnesses globally. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tobacco use and tobacco-caused illnesses and death are increasing in developing countries globally, so it is critical to study these countries in order to effectively address the tobacco epidemic. The proposed project will test the effectiveness of community- based interventions for secondhand smoke and quitting smoking in eight underserved communities in the Dominican Republic. The project will also partner with communities and national and international groups to determine whether the methods and interventions from this study in the Dominican Republic can also be used to help other countries in the region and underserved groups in the United States.              Project Narrative Tobacco use and tobacco-caused illnesses and death are increasing in developing countries globally, so it is critical to study these countries in order to effectively address the tobacco epidemic.

"Motivating Smokers with Mobility Impairments to Quit Smoking    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People with physical disabilities experience similar health disparities as other disadvantaged groups (e.g., no insurance, decreased access to medical and preventive care, more co-morbidities) but significantly less attention is paid to their health promotion. While smoking cessation interventions have been developed for other disadvantaged groups, none exist for people with physical disabilities. People with physical disabilities (mobility impairments) who use assistance to ambulate have higher smoking rates (32.5%) than people who have a disability and do not need assistance (23%) and people who are not disabled (19.8%; Brawarsky et al. 2002). The aims of the current study are to: 1) develop a series of theory-based intervention DVDs focused on motivating smoking cessation among people with mobility impairments (i.e., chronically use some type of assistance to walk such as walker, cane, wheelchair, braces, etc) and 2) test the efficacy of the Intervention DVDs vs. Print-based Standard Care among 560 smokers with mobility impairments in a randomized trial. The materials in both groups will be mailed on a monthly basis for four months, and are organized in separate sections according to readiness to quit. Participants in both groups will receive a) nicotine patches at no cost if they are ready to quit and b) brief phone calls (~5 minutes) between mailings to assess and encourage viewing the materials. We hypothesize that smokers who are randomized to receive the Intervention DVDs will be significantly more likely to achieve 7-day and 30-day point-prevalence abstinence at 1, 6, and 12- month follow-ups vs. those who receive Print-based Standard Care. The Intervention DVDs will be based on Behavioral Activation Theory, and address specific barriers to quitting in this population (increased stress, decreased positive affect, increased depressed mood, activity restriction, and self-efficacy). We hypothesize that the intervention will impact these mediators directly, as well as indirectly through Behavioral Activation (goal setting and pleasant events). Our series of preliminary studies support the use of these mediators for people with mobility impairments and the use of DVDs as an acceptable mode of intervention, given the economic and mobility limitations of this population. If effective, our DVD intervention could have a high level of public health and clinical significance, as it could be easily disseminated at low cost through national disability-related organizations, networks of independent living centers, or physician offices, and substantially improve the health and quality of life for people with physical disabilities. This study is innovative because no studies have targeted this population, it applies Behavioral Activation Theory to smoking cessation, and it examines relatively novel mediators in the field of smoking (e.g., positive affect, behavioral activation). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: No smoking cessation interventions exist that target smokers with mobility impairments, though 32.5% of this population smokes. The current study aims to develop theory-based Intervention DVD's for smoking cessation for people with mobility impairments and test its efficacy for increasing smoking cessation vs. print-based standard care in a randomized trial.           Narrative No smoking cessation interventions exist that target smokers with mobility impairments, though 32.5% of this population smokes.

"Exploring the Role of Race/Ethnicity & Family Influences to Reduce Youth Smoking    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Introduction. Familial factors such as family bonding and parental monitoring have been indicated as explanatory factors for some of the differences in national trends in adolescent smoking initiation and progression. However, little is known about the link between racial/ethnic differences and these family factors with adolescent smoking practices. Purpose. The aims of this application are to examine how race/ethnicity influences the family factors that are influential on adolescents' initial smoking initiation and then progression over time. Aims. We propose to test a model of smoking behaviors guided by The Theory of Triadic Influence (TTI). Within the TTI, we will examine the underlying distal and ultimate influences of smoking behavior. Distal influences that will be examined are parental bonding and connectedness, anti-smoking parenting, and role modeling of smoking. Ultimate influences include parental supervision and monitoring, family conflict, and acculturation. Examination of these influences will address our central hypothesis that racial/ethnic differences in smoking behavior are associated with differences in family attachment as well as pro-smoking influences. Further, these factors will differentially remain consistent in racial/ethnic subgroups that have the lowest rates of smoking behavior throughout adolescence. Aim 1: To determine the relative impact of family and prosmoking influences on concurrent smoking behavior among cross-sectional cohorts of African American, Hispanic, and White youth in their early (ages 9-11), mid (ages 12-13), and late (ages 14-18) adolescent years. Aim 2: To determine which specific familial and prosmoking influences in early adolescence are associated with initiation of smoking within a year. Aim 3: To examine the associations of initial and continuing familial and prosmoking influences with smoking stage progression. Methods. Our hypothesis will be addressed through secondary analysis of The National Survey of Parents and Youth (NSPY). The NSPY collected data from parents (N=7,334 at Round 1) and youth (N=7,796 at Round 1) during each of Rounds 1-4 of NSPY from 1999-2004. Data will be used to provide cross-sectional and longitudinal tests of the models of the initiation and progression of smoking behavior from early to late adolescence. Analyses. To address the cross- sectional analyses, a multi-level modeling approach will be used. Multinomial regression will be used to examine the association of the individual factors with adolescent smoking, followed by assessment of a combined model. After examination of smoking trajectories, latent growth curve modeling will be used to explore changes over time and pathways to tobacco use initiation, incorporating the repeated measures while still allowing for the categorical nature of the outcome measure. Conclusion. By clarifying the role of specific familial factors protective for smoking initiation and progression in different racial/ethnic subgroups and ages, the proposed project may aid in the development of more effective parent-based smoking prevention programs designed for diverse adolescent populations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   There are racial/ethnic differences in the onset of adolescent smoking initiation and progression that may be explained by racial/ethnic differences in familial factors such as anti-smoking parenting practices. There is a strong need for new parental based anti-tobacco prevention interventions as a way to curb initiation and progression of adolescent smoking. However, it is unknown if familial factors that are protective in one racial sub-group are equally protective in another. The primary goal of this application is to explore how race/ethnicity affects familial factors that contribute to adolescents' smoking initiation and progression over time by secondary analysis of The National Survey of Parents and Youth. The results of this project will be essential to developing sound, culturally and age sensitive parental based anti-smoking interventions in the future.           PROJECT NARRATIVE  There are racial/ethnic differences in the onset of adolescent smoking initiation and progression that may be explained by racial/ethnic differences in familial factors such as anti-smoking parenting practices.

"Faith Moves Mountains: A CBPR Appalachian Wellness & Cancer Prevention Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Appalachian communities are disproportionately affected by many of the leading risk factors associated with cancer incidence and mortality, factors amenable to primary and secondary prevention. Extensive involvement with our community partners has demonstrated strong community preference for a holistic approach toward cancer prevention; The proposed intervention extends our successful faith-based, trained lay health advisor tailored intervention, ""Faith Moves Mountains,"" (R01CA108696) initiated three years ago, to administer a culturally appropriate CBPR intervention. Working in partnership with 70 faith based institutions in rural Southeastern Kentucky, we propose to administer, evaluate, and disseminate a tailored wellness and cancer prevention program focused on four of the most common prevention activities that have the potential of greatly preventing and reducing cancer morbidity and mortality. These prevention activities include smoking cessation (targeting all chronic diseases, cervical and lung cancer); energy balance including dietary modification and physical activity promotion (targeting all chronic diseases and colorectal cancer (CRC)), and cancer screenings (targeting CRC, cervical, and breast cancer).      Consistent with our Faith Moves Mountains and cancer control approach, faith-based organizations will sponsor a ""kick off event"" or health fair in which participants will undergo a health risk appraisal (baseline). Participants will then select one or more wellness activities (smoking cessation, energy balance, cancer screening); then, trained lay health advisors will offer modules on each of these wellness activities. Smoking cessation will include the culturally relevant Cooper-Clayton method (outcome: smoking abstinence). For those targeting dietary modification and physical activity, a rural Appalachian modified Healthy Body/Healthy Spirit program will be administered (outcome: dietary change and physical activity participation). Tailored cancer screening promotion will be based on our current Faith Moves Mountains design (outcome: receipt of any recommended CRC screening test, Pap test for cervical cancer, and/or mammogram). To assess the intervention but remain consistent with community norms, we will employ a staggered intervention design. Throughout the project, the RE-AIM model will inform our evaluation. During phase three, this CBPR wellness approach to cancer prevention will undertake qualitative process evaluation interviews and disseminate the intervention to medically underserved Appalachian Ohio in collaboration with partners at Ohio State University. This collaboration will facilitate dissemination of successful intervention to additional rural Appalachian populations with high rates of cancer health disparities.           ",Faith Moves Mountains: A CBPR Appalachian Wellness & Cancer Prevention Program,7758851,R24MD002757,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diet ', ' Institution ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Secondary Cancer Prevention ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Fairs ', ' Health Risk Appraisals ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Cervical ', ' Phase ', ' Incidence ', ' Ensure ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Kentucky ', ' Trust ', ' Rural ', ' Fostering ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Ohio ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rural Health ', ' Smoking ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Event ', ' preference ', ' cancer risk ', ' energy balance ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' holistic approach ', ' Prevention ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Diet Modification ', ' Dietary Modifications ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diet and exercise ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Abstinence ', ' National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities ', ' NCMHD ', ' medically underserved ', ' community based participatory research ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' successful intervention ', ' Regimen ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R24,2010,570775,0.015174484524118882
"CBPR to Reduce Tobacco Smoking among Residents of a Low-Income Urgan Setting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hugely disproportionate burden of death and disease borne by people of color and the poor is not a medical mystery, and its solution does not necessarily require high-tech interventions. Tobacco use is an excellent example because tobacco smoking is a substantial cause of death from five of the seven leading causes of death. Due to concerted public health efforts, smoking prevalence has been reduced by 30% over the last 15 years in the U.S. Yet not all have benefited equally in this great accomplishment. Most of our nation's educated and well-off individuals no longer smoke; the 21% of our adult population who continue to smoke are largely poor, undereducated, and underemployed.      The proposed R24 project ""CBPR to Reduce Tobacco Smoking among Residents of a Low-Income Urban Setting"" aims at reducing several health problems caused by or related to tobacco use among people of color and low-SES whites, through partnership with South West Baltimore community that will result in smoking cessation programs that are more effective and more culturally appropriate. Therefore, the specific aims for the proposed project are: (1) through CBPR and other rigorous scientific methods, develop, implement, and evaluate an intervention to reduce tobacco use that will be sensitive to the needs and characteristics of this community and produce a sustained reduction of tobacco smoking among 36% of the participants in the intervention; (2) to investigate specific marketing strategies that may affect consumption patterns; (3) to explore the ecological factors determining tobacco use and quitting behaviors in this community; and, (4) to implement information systems that will help the community track the scope and features of tobacco smoking, major risk and protective factors, in order to identify potential alternatives of action. The project is designed as Community Based Participatory Experimental Research, with mix quantitative and qualitative methods. Intense community involvement and active participation will be the core value of this proposed research. The effectiveness of interventions will be evaluated rigorously using individually tailored treatments with adaptive treatment strategies that use relatively new statistical approaches for effectiveness evaluations in community settings. ""Active"" and ""passive"" surveillance strategies will be used to analyze the scope, determinants, and dynamics of tobacco use in their community.          ",CBPR to Reduce Tobacco Smoking among

"Case Management for Reaching and Treating Underserved Latino Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K01 Application is to provide Dr. Ana-Paula Cupertino with the necessary research skills and publication track record to launch an independent career focused on reducing tobacco-related health disparities between Latinos and the majority U.S. population. Career Development activities include formal training as well as mentored research experiences. Her proposed training will expand her research repertoire to qualitative methods, tobacco dependence research, models for behavior change, cultural tailoring, and clinical trial design. A publication timeline lists manuscripts she will complete over the course of the award. The Research Plan consists of three studies over five years and focuses on smoking cessation among Latinos in safety net clinics. Study 1 is a multi-method case study, conducted in 3 safety net clinics, that employs qualitative and quantitative research methods. It will provide rich descriptions of how tobacco is currently addressed in clinics and insight into how best to integrate a case management intervention into clinic practices. Study 2 is a randomized pilot study of a case management intervention for promoting smoking cessation among Latinos in safety net clinics. It employs a novel approach for identifying not only smokers in clinics but also other smokers at home. Smokers (N=90) will be randomized to either case management CM or control. Participants in both CM and control will receive educational flyers describing smoking cessation resources available in the community. Participants assigned to CM will also receive telephone-based case management to enhance utilization of cessation resources. Main outcomes include resource utilization (utilization of the state tobacco quitline and smoking cessation pharmacotherapy) and smoking cessation at 6 months. Study 3 consists of structured interviews with Study 2 participants and safety net clinic health care providers. The interviews will identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement for the case management approach. This research will support Dr. Cupertino's development of an R01 application to test this intervention. This NCI K01 Mentored Career Development Award to Promote Diversity will facilitate Dr. Cupertino's growth into a productive, independent scientist dedicated to reducing health disparities among Latinos.           ",Case Management for Reaching and Treating Underserved Latino Smokers,7880196,K01CA136993,"['Counseling ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Address ', ' Build-it ', ' Health system ', ' TimeLine ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' trial design ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' post intervention ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Smoker ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' programs ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' Tobacco ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Award ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Case Management ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Family member ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' quitline ', ' quit line ', ' systems research ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' chronic care model ', ' safety net ', ' Abstinence ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2010,147719,0.17087419069926194
"Correlates of Nicotine Dependence among Urban African American Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities continue to exist between and within populations and little is known about the causes of population differences observed in tobacco use, nicotine dependence, and related diseases. More importantly, an age-race paradox exists in which African American youth consistently report lower prevalence of tobacco use than their Caucasian counterparts, yet African American adult smokers suffer a disproportionate burden of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. Nicotine dependence is the most formidable impediment to quitting smoking among adolescents. Despite the recognition of the central role of nicotine dependence in smoking cessation, there is a paucity of information about how nicotine dependence is expressed among youth who smoke. For these reasons, researchers have called for additional research to address the insufficient understanding of and gap in the literature on adolescent nicotine dependence and its impact on cessation. Thus, I describe a plan to examine critical factors of nicotine dependence among urban African American youth utilizing individual and group (class) trajectory analysis (Study 1) as well as mixed methods research, including a validated measure of nicotine dependence, focus groups, and in-depth interviews (Study 2) to elucidate the complexities of adolescent nicotine dependence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans bear the greatest burden of death and illness due to cigarette smoking. Most adults began smoking as adolescents and nicotine dependence is a critical barrier in quitting smoking. This Award will allow me to examine the nicotine dependence experiences of both adults and youth to better understand how we can help African American youth quit smoking.           PROJECT NARRATIVE: African Americans bear the greatest burden of death and illness due to cigarette smoking.

"Culturally Targeted & Individually Tailored Smoking Cessation Study: LGBT Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goals are to increase smoking cessation in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) smokers and to understand the processes related to cessation and relapse in this underserved population. Conducted in two phases, the primary aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of a culturally targeted intervention versus a non-targeted intervention on smoking cessation outcomes in LGBT smokers. Further aims are to determine the effect of the ALA-CT intervention on individually mediated predictors of cessation and to explore the underlying cultural and psychosocial mechanisms through which the ALA-CT intervention has an impact (differential or not) on smoking cessation. In Phase I, we will use focus groups and a pilot trial to establish the cultural appropriateness and acceptability of the targeted elements of the intervention. In Phase 2, we will conduct a randomized smoking cessation trial to compare for the first time the efficacy of the American Lung Association's 'Freedom from Smoking Program' (ALA-FFS). Culturally targeted (ALA-CT) and Non-Targeted (Standard ALA-FFS) to LGBT smokers. The ALA-CT will consist of 7 culturally targeted (psychosocial and cultural) group counseling sessions combined with nicotine replacement and peer support. The contrast condition will be smokers who receive the non-targeted ALA-FFS program, nicotine replacement and peer support. The primary smoking cessation outcome will be point prevalence abstinence, i.e., no smoking, not even a puff, for previous 7 days, and will be assessed by Timeline Follow-Back derived measures for prolonged abstinence and point prevalence quit rates. Reported outcomes will be objectively verified [Carbon monoxide (CO) testing] at 1 month, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months follow-up to determine short and longer- term cessation outcomes. We will control for demographic variables that have known associations with smoking outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate the benefits of culturally targeted smoking cessation intervention for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender smokers. Findings will contribute to the scientific literature on reducing smoking-related health disparities among underserved populations.              The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate the benefits of culturally targeted smoking cessation intervention for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender smokers.

"Depressive Symptoms and Smoking in Middle-Aged and Older Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking research and intervention efforts have substantially neglected middle-aged and older adults, with older women who smoke particularly underserved. Yet, cigarette smoking is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among women in midlife and aging, and the hazards of smoking for women increase with age. Although adult smoking is maintained in significant part by nicotine addiction, important aspects of women's smoking in midlife and aging may involve psychosocial factors that are amenable to intervention. Depression in particular plays a significant role in maintaining adult smoking, although much less is known about the role of depression among older smokers. The greater prevalence of depression among women makes depression an important concern in women's health in midlife and aging. Although previous research has focused on clinical depression, increasing evidence indicates that sub-clinical levels of depressive symptoms, which are prevalent among women in midlife and aging, are also linked to smoking. However, the lack of a comprehensive model of social contextual and behavioral factors that affect smoking through depression or that mediate between depression and smoking hinders interventions to reduce smoking among women in later adulthood. The Surgeon General's report on women and smoking calls for longitudinal research on depression and smoking in women across the adult lifespan. This project will examine: (1) the relationship of depressive symptoms to smoking among middle-aged and older women, (2) the predictive role of social contextual and personal factors related to depression and smoking, and (3) demographic and health-related factors that make subgroups of women especially vulnerable to depression-related smoking. In this project we will conduct secondary analyses of data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Observational Study. The WHI Observational Study followed 93,676 women between the ages of 50 and 79 at enrollment for up to 8 years. The WHI Observational Study presents a unique opportunity to examine the link between depressive symptoms and smoking in a large diverse sample of postmenopausal women, with psychosocial and health-related data available at multiple time-points. Our research team will approach the study from complementary perspectives. This project is innovative in its unique focus on depression and smoking in middle-aged and older women, its use of the WHI Observational Sample to follow a socioeconomically and ethnically diverse sample longitudinally, and it's modeling of risk and protective factors in the depression-smoking relationship among women in this population. Consistent with Healthy People 2010 objectives to reduce adult smoking, this project will have a positive impact by providing a conceptual foundation for effective smoking reduction interventions with middle-aged and older women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cigarette smoking is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among women in midlife and aging. Reducing adult smoking is a central goal of Healthy People 2010.

"Enhancing cancer outreach for low-income adults with innovative smoking cessation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence indicates that the prevalence of current cigarette smoking among adults in the US has dropped below 20%. While this drop is encouraging, smoking still represents the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the US. Moreover, smoking prevalence is significantly higher among certain population groups, such as those with low levels of education and those living at, or below the poverty level. Therefore, efforts to target these underserved populations with efficacious smoking cessation treatments represents a vital public health effort. The overarching goal of this group-randomized trial is to design and evaluate a novel smoking cessation program targeted to uninsured and underinsured individuals. Key elements of the proposed study will be the use of an established network of community sites (e.g., community centers and churches) and a mobile unit, enabling us to reach individuals confronted with significant barriers to utilizing more traditional smoking cessation treatment approaches.       Specific aims of the study will be to: 1) Compare the efficacy of three smoking cessation interventions targeting community based low income uninsured and underinsured individuals in a group-randomized trial. The interventions will include a Standard Care (SC) approach, consisting of brief advice to quit smoking, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and self-help written materials; an Enhanced Care (EC) approach, consisting of the standard care components plus a single health feedback and motivational interviewing counseling session and a cell phone-delivered text/graphical messaging component; and an Intensive Care (IC) approach, consisting of all SC and EC components plus a series of 11 cell phone-delivered proactive counseling sessions and a cell phone-delivered text/graphical messaging component; 2) Evaluate the role of quit motivation, nicotine withdrawal, risk perception, self- efficacy, social support, and negative affect as potential mediators of smoking abstinence; and 3) Compare the cost-effectiveness of the three treatment conditions.       We believe that of the three conditions, the IC will most successfully address the needs of low-income smokers for several reasons. First, the IC program will be personalized, individualized, and equipped with an intensive, extended counseling and support module provided over the cell phone. Second, the program will combine three intervention components featuring high potential for maintaining support and motivation to quit and prevent relapse. Third, the IC intervention makes use of cell phone technology - an approach that has demonstrated feasibility and efficacy among low-income smokers in previous research conducted by the investigative team. The proposed study offers a number of features (proximity of services to the place of residence, provision of cell phones, etc.) that are likely to reduce treatment barriers while enhancing participant recruitment and retention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will use an existing network of community sites and a mobile unit to deliver smoking cessation treatment to a multiethnic population of uninsured and underinsured adults living in the greater Houston, Texas metropolitan area. The treatments will include components such as brief advice to quit, nicotine patch, written materials, motivational interviewing/health feedback counseling, text/pix messaging, and proactive cell phone counseling.        Project Narrative The proposed study will use an existing network of community sites and a mobile unit to deliver smoking cessation treatment to a multiethnic population of uninsured and underinsured adults living in the greater Houston, Texas metropolitan area.

"Using CBPR to Implement Smoking Cessation in an Urban American Indian Community    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) have the highest smoking rates any ethnic group in the United States, at 41% versus 24% for African Americans and Whites. They also have the lowest quit rates of any group, at 8-10% at 6 months. Due to its long cultural significance as a sacred plant, the entirely negative portrayal of tobacco in most smoking cessation programs is inappropriate, leaving programs unsuccessful. In 2003, AI/AN patients from Haskell Health Center requested a culturally-appropriate smoking cessation program, causing the center director to contact the University of Kansas Medical Center Department of Preventive Medicine. Since that time, the larger AI/AN community in Kansas and Missouri has been working collaboratively with KUMC on the development of a culturally-tailored smoking cessation program, as well as several other projects. In 2006, KUMC and several community-based organizations formed the American Indian Health Research and Education Alliance, dedicated to improving the health of AI/AN using community-based participatory research methods. The culturally-tailored smoking cessation program that began the partnership, All Nations Breath of Life (ANBL), has now been developed and pilot tested and is ready for implementation in the urban AI/AN community of the Kansas City Metroplex. Our pilot data are promising; with a 25% quit rate and 80% participant retention at 6-months post-baseline. We will address the following specific aims: (1) To create appropriate infrastructure (personnel, space, supplies, leadership commitment) for the Heart of America Indian Center to serve as the primary site for implementation of ANBL; (2) To examine the acceptability and feasibility of implementing ANBL in an urban AI/AN community; (3) To estimate the effectiveness of ANBL in an urban AI/AN community; and (4) to identify factors that enhance dissemination of ANBL and contribute to program success or failure. We hypothesize that participants in ANBL will quit smoking at a higher rate than currently reported in the literature for the best available programs. In addition, we will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the program to help determine its sustainability. If this project is successful, ANBL can be disseminated to other AI/AN communities to help them quit smoking. By reducing smoking rates in this community, we can ultimately reduce their leading cause of cancer death (lung cancer) and their leading cause of overall death, cardiovascular disease.           ",Using CBPR to Implement Smoking Cessation in an Urban American Indian Community,7759640,R24MD002773,"['Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adoption ', ' enhancing factor ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Kansas ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Leadership ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Logic ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Maintenance ', ' Americas ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Missouri ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Native Americans ', ' Patients ', ' Plants ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Smoker ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Medical center ', ' success ', ' intervention program ', ' Participant ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' County ', ' Native-Born ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' tobacco control ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' community living ', ' urban native american ', ' urban American Indian ', ' Outcome ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R24,2010,549640,0.2263235474721998
"Dissemination of a Smoking Quitline to the Underserved  Smoking is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States. Moreover, smoking is a critically significant behavioral risk factor that contributes to social disparities in the incidence and mortality of disease. That is, because the prevalence of smoking is higher among individuals with lower socioeconomic status, smoking has a substantial influence on socioeconomic disparities in health- related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, connecting underserved smokers with evidence-based tobacco cessation programs is crucial for disease prevention and the elimination of health disparities. Telephone- based counseling for smoking cessation delivered via quitlines has demonstrated considerable efficacy. However, quitlines are grossly underutilized. Referrals to quitlines generated in primary care settings are low, and a large majority of smokers referred to quitlines fail to contact the quitlines on their own for cessation assistance. Thus, the focus of this study is on increasing dissemination of an existing evidence- based smoking cessation program, the State of Texas Quitline (i.e., Quitline), which is provided by the American Cancer Society. The design of the study is a group-randomized trial that will be conducted in 10 community health clinics. Clinics are part of the Harris County Hospital District (HCHD) and provide care to a very large, racially/ethnically diverse, low socioeconomic status, underserved population of patients residing in the Houston metropolitan area. Clinics will be randomized to either an ""Ask-Advise-Connect"" or an ""Ask-Advise-Refer"" dissemination approach. Smoking status will be assessed and recorded in the electronic medical record (EMR) at every patient visit, and smokers will be connected (in the Ask-Advise- Connect condition) or referred (in the Ask-Advise-Refer control condition) to the Quitline through an automated link contained in the EMR. Smokers in the Ask-Advise-Connect condition will be called proactively by the Quitline, and smokers in the Ask-Advise-Refer condition will be encouraged to call the Quitline on their own. All smokers will be offered a series of proactive counseling calls during their initial call with the Quitline. The project will involve a close partnership and collaboration with the HCHD community health clinics. Outcome measures are based on the RE-AIM conceptual framework and are consistent with current dissemination research models. Primary outcomes include reach, efficacy, and impact of the dissemination approaches. Secondary outcomes include patient-reported fidelity as well as acceptance of and barriers to dissemination of the Quitline among clinic staff. The Ask-Advise-Connect approach to dissemination of an evidence-based tobacco cessation program could be easily maintained by the HCHD clinics and adopted by other health care settings. Thus, findings are likely to have a significant public health impact.

"A Social Ecological Based Smoking Cessation Intervention in Public Housing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American (AA) women in urban, poverty-stricken neighborhoods have high rates of smoking, difficulties with quitting, and disproportionate tobacco-related health disparities. AA women who smoke are twice as likely to die from cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer as other ethnic groups. Assisting this underserved population to quit smoking is a national health priority. Prior research utilizing conventional outsider driven interventions targeted to the individual have failed to show effectiveness with cessation outcomes in this population. Recommendations call for more comprehensive, participatory, and multi-level approaches that address social context (i.e., culture, social networks, and neighborhoods) in health promotion interventions. The broad, long-term objectives of this research are to optimize smoking cessation outcomes and to reduce associated health disparities in AA women living in Southeastern US public housing neighborhoods. Using a participatory and social ecological approach, the academic investigators, advisory board, and public housing residents have developed a multi-level intervention (a.k.a. Sister to Sister) that has demonstrated feasibility and potential effectiveness in increasing short-term cessation. The primary aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of this 24-week, multi-level intervention (Sister to Sister) on long-term (6- and 12-month) cessation in women in public housing neighborhoods. We will randomly assign 14 public housing neighborhoods (25 female smokers in each neighborhood) to either a treatment condition (Sister to Sister) or a delayed intervention control condition. We project 175 smokers for treatment and 175 smokers for control, a total of 350 participants, will be required at baseline to detect proposed treatment effects for the primary outcome of smoking cessation. Treatment participants will receive the Sister to Sister Intervention consisting of: a) individual level strategies with 1:1 community health worker contact to enhance smoking cessation self-efficacy and spiritual well-being; b) interpersonal level strategies with behavioral counseling in small peer groups to enhance social support; c) neighborhood level strategies with policy and countermarketing campaigns led by a neighborhood advisory board; and, d) an 8- week supply of nicotine patches and study-specific written cessation materials. Control participants will receive a delayed treatment intervention. Secondary aims are to test the effect of intervention mediators (self-efficacy, spiritual well-being, social support, and program utilization) and moderators (perceived stress, social influences, and community cohesion) on cessation. Measures will be assessed at baseline, week 24, and week 52. These study findings will advance scientific knowledge on the effectiveness of integrating community- preferred social context in tobacco cessation interventions. Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the US, with widening gaps in health disparities occurring among ethnic minorities. AA women in public housing neighborhoods have high rates of smoking and difficulties in quitting. AA women who smoke are twice as likely to die from heart disease, strokes, and cancer as other ethnic groups. Because traditional smoking cessation programs have had minimal reach or impact with this group, there is a lack of evidence showing us how to help these women quit smoking. Developing effective socio-culturally relevant health promotion interventions that facilitate positive health behaviors will be vital to the elimination of health disparities in this priority population.

"En Pareja: A Latino couples intervention to help expectant fathers quit smoking    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking among Latino males living in the U.S. is a significant public health problem. Latinos smoke at the same rate as White males but are less likely than Whites to quit smoking, which can contribute to health disparities in life expectancy and increase mortality due to lung cancer. Clearly, smoking cessation programs for Latinos are needed. Some programs tested among Latinos have shown efficacy, but at the short-term only. Further, none has attempted to encourage cessation at a teachable moment: a time when cessation may seem more relevant. To reach this underserved population of smokers, we are proposing to conduct a teachable moment intervention trial for recently immigrated Latino smokers in Durham and Raleigh, North Carolina. We will conduct the interventions in Spanish. We will attempt to capitalize on the teachable moment of Latinas' pregnancy as an impetus for Latinos' cessation because pregnancy is a time when men might consider stopping smoking. Also, including the woman could help sustain cessation after the program is complete. Thus, we are intervening with Latino couples to help the men quit smoking. We have partnered with community leaders at El Centro Hispano, a community resource center for Latinos in Durham. We will develop an intervention based primarily on Social Cognitive Theory and the Teachable Moments Model. We will teach men smoking cessation skills, help improve men's self-efficacy and outcome expectancies for quitting, and teach the couples optimal ways to communicate to reduce the stress that comes with a new baby. With better communication, the couple may be able to work together better to help him quit smoking and stay quit. We are proposing to recruit pregnant Latino couples (n=420) into a two-arm smoking cessation intervention. The program will be culturally tailored to emphasize Latino cultural values that could contribute to higher cessation rates, namely familismo, a high value on the family, and personalismo, valuing warm personal relationships. The study arms are: Arm 1: Self-help smoking cessation guide vs. Arm 2: Couple-based smoking cessation counseling. We propose to survey couples face-to-face at five time-points: baseline, 28 weeks gestation, and 2, 6, and 12 months postpartum. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The smoking rate among Latino males is too high. Few effective programs reach and promote long term smoking cessation among Latino Spanish-speaking smokers. This intervention approaches Latinos when their wives are pregnant to increase motivation for quitting. The intervention includes Latinas and teaches the couples effective communication skills to help sustain cessation effects long term.           ",En Pareja: A Latino couples intervention to help expectant fathers quit smoking,7912962,R01CA127307,"['Counseling ', ' Couples ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Elements ', ' Emotions ', ' Address ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Language ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Individual ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Mexican ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Wife ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' North Carolina ', ' Couples Therapy ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Smoker ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Relapse ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' South American ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Country ', ' self help ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' cultural values ', ' risk perception ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' volunteer ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' pregnant ', ' public health relevance ', ' intervention effect ', ' arm ', ' ']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,613541,0.16376482767247744
"Sustaining Tobacco Abstinence after Incarceration With approximately 9 million Americans passing through correctional institutions annually and an average daily population of over 2 million, there are multiple opportunities to address the smoking cessation needs of this high risk and underserved population.1 Tobacco use among prisoners is approximately three times that of the general population2 and minorities, poor, mentally ill and illicit substance using individuals are all overrepresented in correctional facilities. Since the announcement of the negative health consequences of second hand smoke, correctional facilities are increasingly becoming tobacco free. The Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RI DOC) has been tobacco free since February 2003 with no tobacco products allowed anywhere on grounds by inmates or staff. However the majority of inmates return to smoking as soon as they are released back into the community. Motivational Interviewing (MI) can be conceptualized and informed by the self-determination theory. 3. 4 MI utilizes specific techniques for providing feedback based on an individual's risk, and self efficacy. CBT provides the skills necessary to maintain abstinence after release. We aim to capitalize on these periods of forced abstinence by modifying and evaluating an Intensive Behavioral Intervention (6 sessions of in jail MIICBT and two post release telephone booster sessions) compared to a CONcise Iapes Reviewing Obstacles to healthy biving (CONTROL) in a randomized clinical trial. We propose to randomly assign to Intensive ~ehavioral Intervention (lBI) or time equivalent CONTROL eight weeks before release from incarceration. Those randomized to IBI will receive two MI and four CBT sessions in prison and two booster telephone sessions after release. For this two year proposal we will limit follow-up to 12-weeks after release and censor follow-up for those who have relapsed to smoking.

"Effectiveness of Proactive Tobacco Treatment in Diverse Low Income Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a high prevalence of smoking and high burden of tobacco related disease among low income populations. Effective, evidenced-based smoking cessation treatments are available, but low-income and minority smokers are less likely than higher-income and white smokers to use these treatments, especially the most comprehensive forms that include a combination of pharmacotherapy and intensive behavioral counseling. In this application, we test a novel proactive outreach strategy, coupled with free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to increase the population impact of tobacco cessation treatment for diverse, low income smokers. Population impact is the product of treatment utilization (i.e., reach or exposure) and treatment efficacy (i.e., smoking abstinence rates among those who utilize treatment); therefore, the theory- driven approach will systematically offer low income smokers free and easy access to evidence-based treatment for tobacco dependence outside the traditional health care system. The intervention has two primary components: 1) proactive outreach to current smokers in the form of mailed invitation materials and telephone calls containing targeted health messages, and 2) facilitated access to free, comprehensive, evidence-based treatment for tobacco dependence in the form of NRT and intensive, telephone-based behavioral counseling. Our specific aims are to: 1) compare the effect of proactive outreach combined with free NRT and telephone counseling (PRO+NRT+TC) to usual care (UC) on population-level smoking abstinence rates among a diverse population of low income smokers, 2) compare the effect of PRO+NRT+TC to usual care UC on population-level tobacco treatment utilization rates, and 3) determine the cost-effectiveness of PRO+NRT+TC. This proposal will examine the effects of the intervention in a population-based sample (N=2500) of adult smokers enrolled in the Minnesota Health Care Programs (MHCP), a state-funded health insurance plan for low income persons. Baseline data will be obtained from MHCP administrative databases and a participant survey that will be conducted prior to randomization. Outcome data will be collected from a follow-up survey conducted 12 months after randomization and MHCP administrative data. The primary outcome is prolonged smoking abstinence (6 months) and will be assessed at the population level. All randomized individuals will be asked to complete the follow-up survey, regardless of whether they participated in tobacco treatment. Data analysis of the primary aims will follow intent-to-treat methodology. The study team has unique, relevant experience with tobacco treatment studies in diverse, low income populations, proactive outreach and telephone counseling. We will work in partnership with the North American Quitline Consortium to disseminate study findings. If effective, proactive tobacco treatment would reduce tobacco- related morbidity, mortality and health care costs for low income Americans.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a high prevalence of smoking and high burden of tobacco related disease among low income populations.

"Health Advocates as a Vehicle to Improve Treatment for Smokers in Public Housing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quitting smoking is the most important step that smokers can take to benefit their health. However, low-income smokers are less successful in quitting than higher-income smokers. If these socioeconomic disparities in smoking and smoking cessation rates persist, low-income smokers will bear an increasingly disparate burden of smoking-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, interventions to improve the rate of smoking cessation among low-income smokers are urgently needed. Smoking cessation treatment programs such as telephone quitlines and clinic-based programs exist but are underutilized, particularly by low-income smokers. We propose to conduct a group-randomized trial among public housing residents to test whether the use of resident Community Health Advocates with special training in smoking cessation (Tobacco Treatment Advocates (TTAs) can improve (1) utilization of quitlines and clinic-based programs and (2) smoking cessation rates among smokers in public housing. Twenty public housing developments (PHDs) in Boston will be randomly assigned to receive either the TTA intervention or enhanced standard care, with 250 smokers recruited for each condition. The intervention period for each participant will last 6 months, with final outcome assessment 6 months later. At intervention PHDs and TTAs will have 7-9 interactions with smokers to motivate them to use a treatment program, assist in determining which program best meets their needs, proactively connect smokers to programs, address logistical problems and other barriers to program participation, reinforce and augment counseling messages, encourage full utilization of programs including adherence to medication, and provide social support for quitting during and after treatment. Participants at control PHDs will meet once with a TTA who will provide them with culturally-appropriate self-help materials and information on smoking cessation services available through the Quitline and clinic-based programs. The primary outcomes for the study will be (1) utilization of Quitline or clinic-based cessation services (including dose of treatment), and (2) 7-and 30-day biochemically-verified smoking abstinence measured at 3, 7, and 12 months. Data sources for outcomes, as well as hypothesized mediators and moderators, will include quitline and clinic records, TTA records, and questionnaires administered at four time points. A cost-effectiveness evaluation of the cost per additional quit will provide information on the potential for disseminability.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Quitting smoking is the most important step that smokers can take to benefit their health, but low-income smokers are less successful in quitting than higher-income smokers. Interventions to improve the rate of smoking cessation among low-income smokers are urgently needed, or else these smokers will bear an increasingly disparate burden of smoking-related disease and death. Using residents from low-income communities, such as public housing, to help their fellow residents quit smoking may be an effective method to increase the rate of smoking cessation.           Quitting smoking is the most important step that smokers can take to benefit their health, but low-income smokers are less successful in quitting than higher-income smokers.

"Correlates of Nicotine Dependence among Urban African American Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities continue to exist between and within populations and little is known about the causes of population differences observed in tobacco use, nicotine dependence, and related diseases. More importantly, an age-race paradox exists in which African American youth consistently report lower prevalence of tobacco use than their Caucasian counterparts, yet African American adult smokers suffer a disproportionate burden of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. Nicotine dependence is the most formidable impediment to quitting smoking among adolescents. Despite the recognition of the central role of nicotine dependence in smoking cessation, there is a paucity of information about how nicotine dependence is expressed among youth who smoke. For these reasons, researchers have called for additional research to address the insufficient understanding of and gap in the literature on adolescent nicotine dependence and its impact on cessation. Thus, I describe a plan to examine critical factors of nicotine dependence among urban African American youth utilizing individual and group (class) trajectory analysis (Study 1) as well as mixed methods research, including a validated measure of nicotine dependence, focus groups, and in-depth interviews (Study 2) to elucidate the complexities of adolescent nicotine dependence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans bear the greatest burden of death and illness due to cigarette smoking. Most adults began smoking as adolescents and nicotine dependence is a critical barrier in quitting smoking. This Award will allow me to examine the nicotine dependence experiences of both adults and youth to better understand how we can help African American youth quit smoking.           PROJECT NARRATIVE: African Americans bear the greatest burden of death and illness due to cigarette smoking.

"Smoking Cessation Across Ethnic Groups in the US    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Racial/ethnic minorities bear a disproportionate burden of smoking-related diseases and exhibit higher rates of adult smoking and lower rates of quitting compared to Non-Hispanic Whites. Conceptualizations of smoking cessation have been based on Non-Hispanic White populations that are heavy or daily smokers. Racial/ethnic minority groups are more likely to be light and intermittent smokers, thus our understanding of smoking cessation should be examined for their applicability to such populations. Results from this project will have implications for the design and focus of smoking cessation programs for racial/ethnic minority groups.  We propose a secondary data analysis of the Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Survey and the California Tobacco Surveys. All analyses will be conducted for major racial/ethnic groups (African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Native Americans and Non-Hispanic Whites) and their subgroups (e.g., Korean Americans, Hispanics of Mexican descent, etc.), and by gender, age group, English language use, and educational level. Specific Aim 1: Among racial/ethnic minorities, conduct between-group and within-group analyses to better understand light and intermittent smoking in specific population segments. a) Provide an overview of light and intermittent smoking for racial/ethnic groups, especially specific subgroups  that do not have published research, which includes Asian Americans (e.g., Chinese Americans) and  Hispanics/Latinos of Mexican descent, and for African Americans in various geographic regions of the U.S. b) Investigate the effects of state-level tobacco control policy on the distribution of light and intermittent  smoking around the country over time for various racial/ethnic groups. Specific Aim 2: Research has shown that smokers can be categorized along a quitting continuum. We will report on the population distribution of smokers from different racial/ethnic groups along the quitting continuum. c) Hypothesis: The distribution of racial/ethnic minority smokers along the quitting continuum will be skewed  and appear as if they will experience greater quitting success in the future compared to Non-Hispanic  Whites. However, this will not be associated with actual higher rates of successful cessation. Such results would suggest that conceptualizations of the quitting process among minorities need to be reassessed. Specific Aim 3: Evaluate the applicability of smoking cessation treatment modalities to racial/ethnic minorities, particularly among those who are light and intermittent smokers. d) We will evaluate the prevalence of previously identified predictors of cessation, such as reducing  consumption, making prior quit attempts, use of cessation aids (e.g., quitlines, nicotine replacement  therapy), physician advice to quit, and the presence of complete home smoking bans across racial/ethnic  groups. We will then examine how these factors affect the smoking cessation process across groups.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposed study is to examine the process of quitting smoking among racial/ethnic minority groups to better understand why their quitting rates are lower than Non-Hispanic Whites given that minority groups are more likely to be lighter and non-daily smokers. The traditional understanding of the quitting process has been based on populations that were heavy and daily smokers so it might not be applicable to racial/ethnic minority groups. Our findings can have implications for how smoking cessation programs are designed for racial/ethnic minorities and lead to a reduction of disparities in smoking and smoking-related diseases.        The goal of this proposed study is to examine the process of quitting smoking among racial/ethnic minority groups to better understand why their quitting rates are lower than Non-Hispanic Whites given that minority groups are more likely to be lighter and non-daily smokers.

"A Randomized Control Trial of Tobacco Tactics for Operating Engineers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent research indicates that 35 percent of blue-collar workers in the U.S. currently smoke while only 20 percent of white-collar workers smoke. Over the last year, we have been working with heavy equipment operators, specifically Michigan Operating Engineers Local 324 Education Center, to study the epidemiology of tobacco use among this population. Having surveyed 498 Operating Engineers, the data show that smoking rates are high at 29% compared to 21% among the general population. While 57% of the tobacco users surveyed are interested in tobacco cessation services, novel strategies are needed to reach blue collar workers who are less likely to use proven tobacco cessation treatments such as counseling and/or pharmacotherapy. To this end, we have developed the Tobacco Tactics website for Operating Engineers. Responding to PA-09-130 Exploratory Grants for Behavioral Research in Cancer Control (R21), we are proposing a randomized control trial to pilot test the Web-based Tobacco Tactics intervention among Operating Engineers in Michigan compared to the state supported 1-800-QUIT-NOW telephone line, a well- known intervention available in the community (N=100). Both interventions will be offered during regularly scheduled safety training at the union hall and both will include counseling and provision of over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy. However, the Tobacco Tactics website will have humorous graphics tailored to Operating Engineers, tailored cessation feedback from the website, and follow up nurse counseling offered by multi-media options including phone and/or email, and/or e-community. Outcome evaluation will compare those randomized to the Tobacco Tactics Web-based intervention to those randomized to the 1-800-QUIT-NOW control condition on: a) 30-day and 6-month quit rates; b) cotinine levels; c) cigarettes smoked/day; d) number of quit attempts; and e) nicotine addiction. Process evaluation will compare the two groups on the: a) number contacts with intervention; b) minutes of exposure; c) medications used; and d) satisfaction. While we recognize that we are underpowered to obtain significant results of P<.05, this pilot study is designed to show whether the results are in the expected direction. Based on the outcome of this smaller R21, we will develop an RO1 for wider scale testing in conjunction with the International Environment Technology Testing Center which services Operating Engineers across North America (including US, Mexico, and Canada).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Because smoking is high among blue collar workers, we have developed a novel Tobacco Tactics website for Operating Engineers to be tested in a randomized control trial compared to the 1-800-QUIT-NOW state-supported telephone quit line (N=100). If this R21 pilot study shows promising results, we will develop an RO1 to test the Web-based Tobacco Tactics intervention in a larger randomized control trial in conjunction with the International Environment Technology Testing Center which services Operating Engineers across the US, Mexico, and Canada.              Because smoking is high among blue collar workers, we have developed a novel Tobacco Tactics website for Operating Engineers to be tested in a randomized control trial compared to the 1-800-QUIT-NOW state-supported telephone quit line (N=100).

"TESTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TARGETED SMOKING CESSATION MESSAGES IN CONSTRUCTION    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Blue-collar workers, particularly in the construction trades, are more likely to smoke, smoke more heavily, and have less success in quitting compared to white-collar workers. Due to the transient nature of construction work, traditional employer-based worksite interventions are not practical for this population. Research on union-based smoking cessation interventions is promising, but more work is needed to develop simple, cost- effective interventions that can be implemented and sustained in larger union groups. This study will develop and test an innovative and sustainable intervention to increase participation in smoking cessation among union carpenters and floor layers. Using audience segmentation techniques from marketing and health communication, we will develop and deliver targeted smoking cessation messages to different sub-groups of these workers. This approach is focused but simple, and can easily be adopted by unions and trade organizations if found to be effective. The overall aim of this application is to promote smoking cessation in this high-risk group by boosting enrollment in a union-sponsored comprehensive smoking cessation program. We will use audience segmentation to create targeted messages that motivate action toward smoking cessation. After developing targeted messages, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing targeted messaging based on audience segmentation versus standard smoking cessation education. All carpenters will receive information on quitting smoking, and access to comprehensive union-sponsored smoking cessation program. Carpenters in the intervention group will receive additional targeted materials to encourage enrollment in the union's smoking cessation program. The intervention will include monthly mailed messages based on audience segmentation data from our formative research among carpenters who smoke. The main study outcome is rates of enrollment in the smoking cessation program six months after the intervention. Other outcomes include quit rates, number of cigarettes smoked, and readiness to quit. Our study is based on the hypothesis that more effective smoking cessation messages can be shaped by data on attitudes and beliefs among workers. We will test whether carpenters who receive targeted messages based on audience segmentation are more likely to enroll in the union sponsored smoking cessation program, more likely to show change in readiness to quit smoking, and more likely to quit smoking.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will contribute to public health by testing innovative health communication strategies to reduce smoking in a high-risk population. If successful, the new methodologies for smoking cessation used in this study can be extended to other blue collar workers in order to reduce health disparities that exist between different worker populations.              This project will contribute to public health by testing innovative health communication strategies to reduce smoking in a high-risk population.

"Enhancing cancer outreach for low-income adults with innovative smoking cessation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence indicates that the prevalence of current cigarette smoking among adults in the US has dropped below 20%. While this drop is encouraging, smoking still represents the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the US. Moreover, smoking prevalence is significantly higher among certain population groups, such as those with low levels of education and those living at, or below the poverty level. Therefore, efforts to target these underserved populations with efficacious smoking cessation treatments represents a vital public health effort. The overarching goal of this group-randomized trial is to design and evaluate a novel smoking cessation program targeted to uninsured and underinsured individuals. Key elements of the proposed study will be the use of an established network of community sites (e.g., community centers and churches) and a mobile unit, enabling us to reach individuals confronted with significant barriers to utilizing more traditional smoking cessation treatment approaches.       Specific aims of the study will be to: 1) Compare the efficacy of three smoking cessation interventions targeting community based low income uninsured and underinsured individuals in a group-randomized trial. The interventions will include a Standard Care (SC) approach, consisting of brief advice to quit smoking, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and self-help written materials; an Enhanced Care (EC) approach, consisting of the standard care components plus a single health feedback and motivational interviewing counseling session and a cell phone-delivered text/graphical messaging component; and an Intensive Care (IC) approach, consisting of all SC and EC components plus a series of 11 cell phone-delivered proactive counseling sessions and a cell phone-delivered text/graphical messaging component; 2) Evaluate the role of quit motivation, nicotine withdrawal, risk perception, self- efficacy, social support, and negative affect as potential mediators of smoking abstinence; and 3) Compare the cost-effectiveness of the three treatment conditions.       We believe that of the three conditions, the IC will most successfully address the needs of low-income smokers for several reasons. First, the IC program will be personalized, individualized, and equipped with an intensive, extended counseling and support module provided over the cell phone. Second, the program will combine three intervention components featuring high potential for maintaining support and motivation to quit and prevent relapse. Third, the IC intervention makes use of cell phone technology - an approach that has demonstrated feasibility and efficacy among low-income smokers in previous research conducted by the investigative team. The proposed study offers a number of features (proximity of services to the place of residence, provision of cell phones, etc.) that are likely to reduce treatment barriers while enhancing participant recruitment and retention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will use an existing network of community sites and a mobile unit to deliver smoking cessation treatment to a multiethnic population of uninsured and underinsured adults living in the greater Houston, Texas metropolitan area.

"Motivating Smokers with Mobility Impairments to Quit Smoking    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People with physical disabilities experience similar health disparities as other disadvantaged groups (e.g., no insurance, decreased access to medical and preventive care, more co-morbidities) but significantly less attention is paid to their health promotion. While smoking cessation interventions have been developed for other disadvantaged groups, none exist for people with physical disabilities. People with physical disabilities (mobility impairments) who use assistance to ambulate have higher smoking rates (32.5%) than people who have a disability and do not need assistance (23%) and people who are not disabled (19.8%; Brawarsky et al. 2002). The aims of the current study are to: 1) develop a series of theory-based intervention DVDs focused on motivating smoking cessation among people with mobility impairments (i.e., chronically use some type of assistance to walk such as walker, cane, wheelchair, braces, etc) and 2) test the efficacy of the Intervention DVDs vs. Print-based Standard Care among 560 smokers with mobility impairments in a randomized trial. The materials in both groups will be mailed on a monthly basis for four months, and are organized in separate sections according to readiness to quit. Participants in both groups will receive a) nicotine patches at no cost if they are ready to quit and b) brief phone calls (~5 minutes) between mailings to assess and encourage viewing the materials. We hypothesize that smokers who are randomized to receive the Intervention DVDs will be significantly more likely to achieve 7-day and 30-day point-prevalence abstinence at 1, 6, and 12- month follow-ups vs. those who receive Print-based Standard Care. The Intervention DVDs will be based on Behavioral Activation Theory, and address specific barriers to quitting in this population (increased stress, decreased positive affect, increased depressed mood, activity restriction, and self-efficacy). We hypothesize that the intervention will impact these mediators directly, as well as indirectly through Behavioral Activation (goal setting and pleasant events). Our series of preliminary studies support the use of these mediators for people with mobility impairments and the use of DVDs as an acceptable mode of intervention, given the economic and mobility limitations of this population. If effective, our DVD intervention could have a high level of public health and clinical significance, as it could be easily disseminated at low cost through national disability-related organizations, networks of independent living centers, or physician offices, and substantially improve the health and quality of life for people with physical disabilities. This study is innovative because no studies have targeted this population, it applies Behavioral Activation Theory to smoking cessation, and it examines relatively novel mediators in the field of smoking (e.g., positive affect, behavioral activation). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: No smoking cessation interventions exist that target smokers with mobility impairments, though 32.5% of this population smokes. The current study aims to develop theory-based Intervention DVD's for smoking cessation for people with mobility impairments and test its efficacy for increasing smoking cessation vs. print-based standard care in a randomized trial.           Narrative No smoking cessation interventions exist that target smokers with mobility impairments, though 32.5% of this population smokes.

"The Effects of Smoking and Expectancy on ERP Measures of Attentional Bias    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The focus of this proposal is to provide the applicant with the skills, experience, and mentoring to become an independent researcher with a focus on understanding the neurobehavioral determinants of nicotine dependence. The training plan outlined in this proposal will allow me to expand my skills by providing an opportunity to become proficient in the use of event-related potential (ERP) electroencephalography (EEC) techniques to study attentional and emotional mechanisms related to nicotine dependence. This work will be conducted at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, where I will be mentored by distinguished scientists in the field of nicotine dependence. This multidisciplinary team will provide oversight of my research and training experiences by providing specific expertise in the areas of neurobehavior, ERP, attentional biases, and gender differences of smoking. The focus of the Research Plan is to gain a greater understanding of the attentional biases of smokers in order to expand our knowledge of how drug and affective cues help to maintain neural sensitization to drugs of abuse. The proposed study would be the first to evaluate the attentional bias of smokers using a within-subjects balanced placebo design, allowing for the separation of the effects of nicotine from the effects of smoking cues on ERP attentional response to smoking and affective cues. The specific aims of this proposal are (a) to distinguish the effects of nicotine's pharmacological properties from those resulting from learned associations on the attentional distraction by smoking and affective cues in dependent smokers, (b) to determine whether gender differences exist in the attentional distraction by smoking and affective cues, (c) to determine whether the expectation of imminent tobacco use increases the attentional distraction by smoking and affective cues, and (d) to assess whether ERP measures of attentional distraction by smoking and affective cues correlate with traditional self-reported measures of nicotine dependence, craving, and affect.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Smoking dependence is thought to be maintained by the brain's attentional bias towards cues in the environment that remind the dependent invidual of smoking. This study will use event-related potential (ERP) EEG technology to investigate these attentional biases and circumstances that provoke them.           ",The Effects of Smoking and Expectancy on ERP Measures of Attentional Bias,8082786,K23DA024697,"['Expectancy ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Smoke ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' trial design ', ' Mentorship ', ' Smoker ', ' visual information ', ' Slide ', ' human subject ', ' Relapse ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' psychophysical ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Reaction Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Response Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Emotions ', ' Dependence ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' expectation ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' drug of abuse ', ' drugs of abuse ', ' drugs abused ', ' abused drugs ', ' Laboratories ', ' Scientist ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Sampling ', ' Affect ', ' Area ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Cells ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Research Training ', ' Address ', ' Technology ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Research ', ' Stimulus ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' career ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' programs ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Techniques ', ' public health relevance ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Cues ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' indexing ', ' Exposure to ', ' Mentors ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' Smoking ', ' craving ', ' Gender ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' experience ', ' Instruction ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Process ', ' Dose ', ' skills ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Placebos ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Cognitive ', ' Emotional ', ' Data ', ' Knowledge ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Grant ', ' Training ', ' response ', ' Work ', ' Deception ', ' Legal ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' event related potential ', ' distraction ', ' Cognitive Science ', ' cognitive psychology ', ' Ethical Issues ', ' Digit structure ', ' Digit ', ' cue reactivity ', ' University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center ', ' University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ', ' MDACC ', ' Association Learning ', ' deprivation ', ' Affective ', ' information processing ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Peripheral Nervous System ', ' Cigarette ', ' neurobehavior ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K23,2011,178416,0.19225013442872452
"CBPR to Reduce Tobacco Smoking among Residents of a Low-Income Urgan Setting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hugely disproportionate burden of death and disease borne by people of color and the poor is not a medical mystery, and its solution does not necessarily require high-tech interventions. Tobacco use is an excellent example because tobacco smoking is a substantial cause of death from five of the seven leading causes of death. Due to concerted public health efforts, smoking prevalence has been reduced by 30% over the last 15 years in the U.S. Yet not all have benefited equally in this great accomplishment. Most of our nation's educated and well-off individuals no longer smoke; the 21% of our adult population who continue to smoke are largely poor, undereducated, and underemployed.      The proposed R24 project ""CBPR to Reduce Tobacco Smoking among Residents of a Low-Income Urban Setting"" aims at reducing several health problems caused by or related to tobacco use among people of color and low-SES whites, through partnership with South West Baltimore community that will result in smoking cessation programs that are more effective and more culturally appropriate. Therefore, the specific aims for the proposed project are: (1) through CBPR and other rigorous scientific methods, develop, implement, and evaluate an intervention to reduce tobacco use that will be sensitive to the needs and characteristics of this community and produce a sustained reduction of tobacco smoking among 36% of the participants in the intervention; (2) to investigate specific marketing strategies that may affect consumption patterns; (3) to explore the ecological factors determining tobacco use and quitting behaviors in this community; and, (4) to implement information systems that will help the community track the scope and features of tobacco smoking, major risk and protective factors, in order to identify potential alternatives of action. The project is designed as Community Based Participatory Experimental Research, with mix quantitative and qualitative methods. Intense community involvement and active participation will be the core value of this proposed research. The effectiveness of interventions will be evaluated rigorously using individually tailored treatments with adaptive treatment strategies that use relatively new statistical approaches for effectiveness evaluations in community settings. ""Active"" and ""passive"" surveillance strategies will be used to analyze the scope, determinants, and dynamics of tobacco use in their community.          ",CBPR to Reduce Tobacco Smoking among

"Maximizing state & local policies to restrict tobacco marketing at point of sale    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The point of sale (POS) is where tobacco companies spend the vast majority of their marketing budget and have enjoyed the greatest freedom from regulation. Regulatory efforts by states and communities have included licensing and zoning laws to limit the number, location and concentration (density) of tobacco retailers, and minimum price laws to reduce the supply of discount tobacco products. State and local agencies are also increasingly focused on eliminating racial and socioeconomic disparities in the amount of marketing and the density of tobacco retailers. Signed into law in June, 2009, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA) will change dramatically the tobacco retail environment because it grants states and communities new power to regulate the time, place, and manner of POS tobacco marketing. The broad goal of the proposed research is to establish timely and crucial national surveillance of how the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and states implement new regulations, the impact on the retail environment, and the response of tobacco companies. The specific aims are to examine changes in tobacco marketing and pack prices in a representative sample of U.S. retailers, conduct implementation research that will guide states and communities seeking to more effectively regulate POS tobacco marketing, measure annual change in the density and composition of tobacco retailers in a representative sample of U.S. counties, and disseminate information on POS marketing and tobacco retailer density nationwide. This will be accomplished using state-of-the-art surveillance and ecological assessment methods to select a longitudinal sample of 2,000 retailers and conduct in-store audits of tobacco marketing and price at three time points. POS policies and their implementation will be accessed via a national survey of tobacco control program leaders in every state, conducted at the same three time points. Six case studies and four legal research projects regarding POS restrictions will also be conducted. The established surveillance mechanism and the dissemination of study results will serve as important resources for national, state, and local efforts to reduce the public health toll attributable to tobacco use.           ",Maximizing state & local policies to restrict tobacco marketing at point of sale,8017609,U01CA154281,"['socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Sales ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Licensing ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Legal ', ' Budgets ', ' Smoking Prevention ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' Marketing ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' County ', ' national surveillance ', ' tobacco control ', ' discount ', ' Legal ', ' Environment ', ' Smoking Prevention ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' discount ', ' Family ', ' Freedom ', ' Liberty ', ' Advertising ', ' Affect ', ' density ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Industry ', ' Laws ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Licensing ', ' Policies ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sales ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' Location ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' meetings ', ' Budgets ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Regulation ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Communities ', ' tobacco control ', ' Instruction ', ' implementation research ', ' national surveillance ', ' Tobacco ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' density ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Time ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Communities ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' meetings ', ' Sampling ', ' Measures ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Laws ', ' Methods ', ' Goals ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' implementation research ', ' Policies ', ' Location ', ' programs ', ' Grant ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U01,2011,1277162,0.1395147012810475
"Socioeconomic status and smoking exposure in Appalachia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Social inequalities are an important predictor of disease incidence, including cancer. Persons with low socioeconomic status (SES) have increased rates of lung and other tobacco-related cancers. Although smoking prevalence is higher in persons with lower levels of education and occupational status, smoking prevalence does not explain this excess risk. In prospective cohort studies, the associations between low SES and elevated lung cancer risk persist after adjustment for smoking amount and duration. The investigators' overall hypothesis is that the unaccounted increased risk in populations with lower SES is due to higher smoke exposure that cannot be accounted for by self-reported smoking habits. Their previous laboratory studies demonstrate that there is a wide degree of variation in biological exposure to tobacco smoke toxins and carcinogens per cigarette smoked. The investigators propose to conduct a community-based participatory study in the medically underserved area of Appalachian Pennsylvania to determine the relationship between SES and the dose of inhaled mainstream smoke and the dose of biological markers of tobacco smoke exposure. Specific aims are: Specific Aim 1. Determine whether SES is associated with smoking puffing behaviors including puff volume, duration, interval, and length of cigarette smoked. Specific Aim 2. Determine whether SES is associated with biomarkers of smoking exposure including salivary cotinine and expired carbon monoxide. This addresses the SES hypothesis using biological measures of dose in addition to environmental measures such as puffing dose. Specific Aim 3. Correlate environmental and biological measures of smoke exposure. This aim will determine whether levels of mainstream smoke exposure, as estimated by puffing profiles are determinants of the biological levels of cigarette smoke exposure, and whether this relationship differs by SES. This brings together aims 1 and 2 to comprehensively address the SES hypothesis. Specific Aim 4. Determine the effects of psychological stress, as assessed by psychological scales and salivary stress biomarkers, on smoking puffing parameters and salivary cotinine levels. The proposed research study will be conducted in Appalachia, Pennsylvania (PA), a NIH-designated medically underserved but socioeconomically diverse population. The investigators predict that lower SES is associated with higher smoke intake as determined by topography and smoke biomarkers, and that this finding will help to explain the long-observed patterns of lung cancer incidence disparities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A major objective of cancer control efforts is to understand the causes of social inequalities in cancer rates. Cigarette smokers of lower socioeconomic status (SES) have increased rates of lung cancer and other tobacco-related diseases than smokers of higher SES.

"Feasibility of a Web-based Smoking Cessation Program for Vocational Students    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young adults and individuals in the lowest socioeconomic status (SES) categories report the highest rates of cigarette use and lowest rates of cessation. Although young adult smokers from backgrounds characterized by low SES are just as likely as their higher SES peers to attempt to quit smoking, they are less likely to use effective cessation treatments and less likely to actually quit. Individuals who occupy lower SES categories may not use effective cessation treatments due to lack of resources, assistance, and/or support. These individuals may also prefer to quit on their own, without the use of cessation aids. Web-based programs tailored to individual characteristics relevant to smoking cessation are one of the only types of cessation programs that are self-directed and can reach large numbers of smokers for very little cost. Yet, research examining smoking cessation using tailored web-based programs has focused almost exclusively on higher SES, White female smokers. The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of a tailored web-based cessation program for a racially/ethnically diverse sample of young adult smokers from lower SES backgrounds. Utilization and acceptability will be assessed by randomly assigning individuals either to a tailored web-based smoking cessation program based on social cognitive theory and studies of persuasive communications or to a control condition comprising a non-tailored web-based program providing evidence- based smoking cessation information. Both programs will be self-paced, allowing individuals to choose when and where they visit them. Participants will be smokers enrolled in post-secondary vocational/technical programs who want to quit smoking. The Specific Aims of the proposed project are to 1) Determine if young adult smokers from low SES backgrounds will use a tailored web-based cessation program and find it an acceptable means for quitting, 2) Identify the psychosocial variables relevant to young adult smokers from low SES backgrounds (e.g., financial stress, role overload, depressive symptoms) that contribute to variability in utilization and acceptability of the web-based program, and 3) Use individual interviews to determine how to increase utilization and acceptability of the tailored web-based program, and maximize its appeal to young adult smokers from low SES backgrounds. If successful, this project will lead to a multi-year R01 proposal testing the efficacy of a tailored web-based smoking cessation program in a larger randomized controlled trial. Results from Specific Aims 2 and 3 will be used to modify the existing web-based program to further tailor it to the needs of young adults occupying lower SES categories. The long-term goal of this research is to develop effective smoking cessation programs for young adults from low SES backgrounds that ultimately will decrease disparities in tobacco use and tobacco-related morbidity and mortality.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Young adults and individuals occupying the lowest socioeconomic status (SES) categories are disproportionately represented among smokers. Identifying low-cost smoking cessation programs that can reach, appeal to, and are effective for large numbers of smokers from low SES backgrounds, will have a major impact on decreasing disparities in smoking and smoking-related morbidity and mortality.           Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States.

"Smoking Cessation Interventions and Program Availability for Drug and Alcohol Add    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of smoking among individuals seeking treatment for a co-occurring substance abuse condition is very high, between 70%-95% (Burling & Ziff, 1988; Fiore et al., 2000; Kozlowski et al., 1986; McCarthy et al., 2002). However, many drug treatment facilities do not encourage smoking cessation during treatment, even though patients are often show interest in quitting smoking. Research finds that not only are low income people more likely to smoke, but the resources for smoking cessation may not be as accessible as those who have higher income (Novotny & Giovino, 1998; MMRW, November 9, 2007; Barbeau et al., 2004; Honjo et al., 2006). Therefore, substance abuse treatment is a context where evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for smoking might have the best chance of reaching low-income smokers. Treating patient smoking concurrent with other drugs is important since research demonstrates that addiction to nicotine may cause changes in brain chemistry and structure which could trigger drug and alcohol cravings, decreasing the chance of prolonged sobriety (Britt & McGehee, 2008; Yeh et al., 2007). The proposed project pursues two objectives related to understanding the adoption, implementation, and sustainability (or conversely discontinuation) of EBTs for smoking in substance abuse treatment contexts. The first aim examines longitudinally the availability of EBTs for smoking among those seeking treatment for co-occurring substance abuse and explores the predictors of changes in service availability over time in treatment programs. Key categories of predictors include the percentage of low-income clients served by the treatment center, organizational and policy factors, and workforce characteristics. The second aim also uses a longitudinal design to examine the evidence-based clinical practice behaviors that counselors engage in with clients. This is important because individuals implement EBTs not organizations or treatment programs (Fixsen et al., 1995). Integrating theory and research from implementation science, public health, organizational change, substance abuse treatment, and health services delivery four categories of moderator variables are examined to understand why and under what conditions counselors are likely to engage clients in smoking cessation efforts with clients.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health-related risks of smoking make it a major public health concern, particularly in light of recent research suggesting that the addictive properties of nicotine are similar to that of opiates. There are also health disparities in both smoking behavior and smoking treatment as a function of socio-economic status and race/ethnicity. Many low-income people also lack access to high quality medical care (Warnecke et al., 2008) and are over-represented in substance abuse treatment contexts. By focusing on the availability, implementation, and sustainability of evidence-based treatments for smoking in the context of substance abuse treatment the proposed application has clear public health (including public health policy) relevance.           The health-related risks of smoking make it a major public health concern, particularly in light of recent research suggesting that the addictive properties of nicotine are similar to that of opiates.

"Faith Moves Mountains: A CBPR Appalachian Wellness & Cancer Prevention Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Appalachian communities are disproportionately affected by many of the leading risk factors associated with cancer incidence and mortality, factors amenable to primary and secondary prevention. Extensive involvement with our community partners has demonstrated strong community preference for a holistic approach toward cancer prevention; The proposed intervention extends our successful faith-based, trained lay health advisor tailored intervention, ""Faith Moves Mountains,"" (R01CA108696) initiated three years ago, to administer a culturally appropriate CBPR intervention. Working in partnership with 70 faith based institutions in rural Southeastern Kentucky, we propose to administer, evaluate, and disseminate a tailored wellness and cancer prevention program focused on four of the most common prevention activities that have the potential of greatly preventing and reducing cancer morbidity and mortality. These prevention activities include smoking cessation (targeting all chronic diseases, cervical and lung cancer); energy balance including dietary modification and physical activity promotion (targeting all chronic diseases and colorectal cancer (CRC)), and cancer screenings (targeting CRC, cervical, and breast cancer).      Consistent with our Faith Moves Mountains and cancer control approach, faith-based organizations will sponsor a ""kick off event"" or health fair in which participants will undergo a health risk appraisal (baseline). Participants will then select one or more wellness activities (smoking cessation, energy balance, cancer screening); then, trained lay health advisors will offer modules on each of these wellness activities. Smoking cessation will include the culturally relevant Cooper-Clayton method (outcome: smoking abstinence). For those targeting dietary modification and physical activity, a rural Appalachian modified Healthy Body/Healthy Spirit program will be administered (outcome: dietary change and physical activity participation). Tailored cancer screening promotion will be based on our current Faith Moves Mountains design (outcome: receipt of any recommended CRC screening test, Pap test for cervical cancer, and/or mammogram). To assess the intervention but remain consistent with community norms, we will employ a staggered intervention design. Throughout the project, the RE-AIM model will inform our evaluation. During phase three, this CBPR wellness approach to cancer prevention will undertake qualitative process evaluation interviews and disseminate the intervention to medically underserved Appalachian Ohio in collaboration with partners at Ohio State University. This collaboration will facilitate dissemination of successful intervention to additional rural Appalachian populations with high rates of cancer health disparities.           ",Faith Moves Mountains: A CBPR Appalachian Wellness & Cancer Prevention Program,8019092,R24MD002757,"['Health Risk Appraisals ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' holistic approach ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Health Fairs ', ' Trust ', ' Ohio ', ' Diet Modification ', ' Dietary Modifications ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' diet and exercise ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' energy balance ', ' Mammography ', ' Mammogram ', ' successful intervention ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Kentucky ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities ', ' NCMHD ', ' Pap smear ', ' cervical/vaginal smear ', ' Vaginal Smears ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Cervical Smears ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' medically underserved ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' Diet ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Secondary Cancer Prevention ', ' Institution ', ' Cervical ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Fostering ', ' Smoking ', ' Communities ', ' Training ', ' Population ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Prevention ', ' Address ', ' Methods ', ' response ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Phase ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Testing ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Participant ', ' Collaborations ', ' Event ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Evaluation ', ' Process ', ' Ensure ', ' Incidence ', ' Rural Health ', ' Regimen ', ' member ', ' programs ', ' Affect ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' base ', ' Outcome ', ' Research ', ' Interview ', ' Rural ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Work ', ' Goals ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Universities ', ' Physical activity ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Health ', ' Modeling ', ' cancer risk ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' preference ', ' Abstinence ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R24,2011,558598,0.015174484524118882
"A Social Ecological Based Smoking Cessation Intervention in Public Housing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American (AA) women in urban, poverty-stricken neighborhoods have high rates of smoking, difficulties with quitting, and disproportionate tobacco-related health disparities. AA women who smoke are twice as likely to die from cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer as other ethnic groups. Assisting this underserved population to quit smoking is a national health priority. Prior research utilizing conventional outsider driven interventions targeted to the individual have failed to show effectiveness with cessation outcomes in this population. Recommendations call for more comprehensive, participatory, and multi-level approaches that address social context (i.e., culture, social networks, and neighborhoods) in health promotion interventions. The broad, long-term objectives of this research are to optimize smoking cessation outcomes and to reduce associated health disparities in AA women living in Southeastern US public housing neighborhoods. Using a participatory and social ecological approach, the academic investigators, advisory board, and public housing residents have developed a multi-level intervention (a.k.a. Sister to Sister) that has demonstrated feasibility and potential effectiveness in increasing short-term cessation. The primary aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of this 24-week, multi-level intervention (Sister to Sister) on long-term (6- and 12-month) cessation in women in public housing neighborhoods. We will randomly assign 14 public housing neighborhoods (25 female smokers in each neighborhood) to either a treatment condition (Sister to Sister) or a delayed intervention control condition. We project 175 smokers for treatment and 175 smokers for control, a total of 350 participants, will be required at baseline to detect proposed treatment effects for the primary outcome of smoking cessation. Treatment participants will receive the Sister to Sister Intervention consisting of: a) individual level strategies with 1:1 community health worker contact to enhance smoking cessation self-efficacy and spiritual well-being; b) interpersonal level strategies with behavioral counseling in small peer groups to enhance social support; c) neighborhood level strategies with policy and countermarketing campaigns led by a neighborhood advisory board; and, d) an 8- week supply of nicotine patches and study-specific written cessation materials. Control participants will receive a delayed treatment intervention. Secondary aims are to test the effect of intervention mediators (self-efficacy, spiritual well-being, social support, and program utilization) and moderators (perceived stress, social influences, and community cohesion) on cessation. Measures will be assessed at baseline, week 24, and week 52. These study findings will advance scientific knowledge on the effectiveness of integrating community- preferred social context in tobacco cessation interventions. Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the US, with widening gaps in health disparities occurring among ethnic minorities. AA women in public housing neighborhoods have high rates of smoking and difficulties in quitting. AA women who smoke are twice as likely to die from heart disease, strokes, and cancer as other ethnic groups. Because traditional smoking cessation programs have had minimal reach or impact with this group, there is a lack of evidence showing us how to help these women quit smoking. Developing effective socio-culturally relevant health promotion interventions that facilitate positive health behaviors will be vital to the elimination of health disparities in this priority population.

"Using CBPR to Implement Smoking Cessation in an Urban American Indian Community    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) have the highest smoking rates any ethnic group in the United States, at 41% versus 24% for African Americans and Whites. They also have the lowest quit rates of any group, at 8-10% at 6 months. Due to its long cultural significance as a sacred plant, the entirely negative portrayal of tobacco in most smoking cessation programs is inappropriate, leaving programs unsuccessful. In 2003, AI/AN patients from Haskell Health Center requested a culturally-appropriate smoking cessation program, causing the center director to contact the University of Kansas Medical Center Department of Preventive Medicine. Since that time, the larger AI/AN community in Kansas and Missouri has been working collaboratively with KUMC on the development of a culturally-tailored smoking cessation program, as well as several other projects. In 2006, KUMC and several community-based organizations formed the American Indian Health Research and Education Alliance, dedicated to improving the health of AI/AN using community-based participatory research methods. The culturally-tailored smoking cessation program that began the partnership, All Nations Breath of Life (ANBL), has now been developed and pilot tested and is ready for implementation in the urban AI/AN community of the Kansas City Metroplex. Our pilot data are promising; with a 25% quit rate and 80% participant retention at 6-months post-baseline. We will address the following specific aims: (1) To create appropriate infrastructure (personnel, space, supplies, leadership commitment) for the Heart of America Indian Center to serve as the primary site for implementation of ANBL; (2) To examine the acceptability and feasibility of implementing ANBL in an urban AI/AN community; (3) To estimate the effectiveness of ANBL in an urban AI/AN community; and (4) to identify factors that enhance dissemination of ANBL and contribute to program success or failure. We hypothesize that participants in ANBL will quit smoking at a higher rate than currently reported in the literature for the best available programs. In addition, we will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the program to help determine its sustainability. If this project is successful, ANBL can be disseminated to other AI/AN communities to help them quit smoking. By reducing smoking rates in this community, we can ultimately reduce their leading cause of cancer death (lung cancer) and their leading cause of overall death, cardiovascular disease.           ",Using CBPR to Implement Smoking Cessation in an Urban American Indian Community,8046419,R24MD002773,"['Modeling ', ' Patients ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Testing ', ' Life ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Methods ', ' Goals ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' United States ', ' Data ', ' Affect ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Research ', ' Outcome ', ' Health ', ' Communities ', ' Universities ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Time ', ' Participant ', ' Americas ', ' Logic ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' urban native american ', ' urban American Indian ', ' enhancing factor ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Missouri ', ' community organizations ', ' Kansas ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' community living ', ' Community Participation ', ' tobacco control ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Cities ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Literature ', ' success ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Heart ', ' Left ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Work ', ' programs ', ' Address ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Effectiveness ', ' improved ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Medical center ', ' County ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Reporting ', ' Maintenance ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Tobacco ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Phase ', ' Publishing ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Native-Born ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Qualifying ', ' Leadership ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Smoker ', ' intervention program ', ' Plants ', ' Adoption ', ' Smoking ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R24,2011,549372,0.2263235474721998
"The Impact of a Tobacco Control Intervention in African-American Families    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly 25 million US adults and 6.4 million children living today will die prematurely from tobacco-attributable diseases unless adults are successful with cessation and rates of child tobacco use are halted. Fifteen million US children <18 years old are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) mostly in their homes and parent modeling of smoking is identified as an important factor for the 4,000 children who initiate tobacco use each day. With widening gaps in health disparities for African Americans (AAs) related to the health effects of tobacco use, culturally sensitive approaches that may be effective need to be fully tested. Based on concepts from Social Cognitive Theory and taking a social ecological perspective, this research will investigate the effects of a family approach that includes child and parent/guardian (PIG) interventions on tobacco control. Subjects will include 4th grade AA children (N=400) and Ps/Gs; 50% rural and 50% inner-city. Using a two group design with repeated measures, schools (20) will be randomly assigned to treatment or control. Children and Ps/Gs in the treatment group will receive a yearly intervention for two years and the control group will receive matched contact and attention on general health education. The child intervention (Botvin's LifeSkills (BLS) consist of 8 classroom sessions taught during 4th and 5th grades (16 total sessions) by trained school personnel. The PIG intervention (BLS Parent) consists of 8 home-based modules during the 4th and 5th grades that promote PIG use of anti- tobacco socialization in the home and reinforce the school-based child intervention. Ps/Gs who smoke will also receive motivational interviewing and nicotine replacement therapy based on their readiness to quit. Behavioral change will be measured by self-report in children and Ps/Gs at baseline, 12 weeks (short-term) and 9 months (long-term) after each year of intervention (2) and also via salivary cotinine at three time points (baseline, at year 2 and at year 4). We propose this family approach will foster development of personal and environmental protective factors in children and their Ps/Gs for tobacco control. The primary hypotheses are: Children and Ps/ Gs in the treatment group will have improved behavioral outcomes of: 1) lower ETS exposure in children; 2) lower rates of tobacco experimentation in children; 3) higher PIG self-efficacy in delivering anti-tobacco socialization in the home; and 4) higher tobacco cessation rates in Ps/Gs. This research addresses a significant public health concern, tobacco use, which remains the single most preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. Consistent with both the NCI and the NICHD, this application targets the advancement of socio-cultural behavioral treatments for children and their families, the prevention of tobacco-related diseases, particularly cancer, and the elimination of health disparities among an ethnic minority group-AA. The need for theory-based effective interventions validated by biochemical measures is imperative for tobacco control. If effective, implementation of this family approach via the school systems as the primary point of entry is highly probable.           ",The Impact of a Tobacco Control Intervention in African-American Families,8075085,R01CA118066,"['Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' effective intervention ', ' Prevention program ', ' Minor ', ' Smoking ', ' Abstinence ', ' Surgeon ', ' Rural ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' treatment effect ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Smoke ', ' group intervention ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Smoker ', ' Control Groups ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Gender ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Self Management ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' residence ', ' skills ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Health ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Prevalence ', ' Morbidity -

"Treatment modality and socioeconomic status in treating tobacco dependence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lower socioeconomic status (SES) and rural groups are overrepresented among smokers and suffer disproportionately from tobacco-related diseases. Arkansas has a high proportion of lower SES and rural residents and one of the highest rates of smoking in the nation. Through the Arkansas Department of Health, the state offered a free, statewide, intensive, evidence-based tobacco dependence treatment program delivered in two modalities: over the telephone and in person. Extensive clinical, demographic, SES-related, and outcome data were collected on approximately12,000 smokers seeking treatment. Data from this treatment program provide unique opportunities to clinically and demographically describe and compare treatment outcomes as a function of treatment modality, independent of treatment content, and to identify factors that predict success for each modality in this primarily lower SES sample. Factors that predict success in quitting for lower SES groups may differ by modality, as well as from factors that generally predict success for higher SES groups. In the proposed study, we will analyze existing data from this tobacco dependence treatment program, pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Describe and compare the demographic and clinical characteristics of tobacco users who elect telephone versus in-person treatment, using descriptive statistics and significance testing; (2) compare treatment utilization and treatment exposure for telephone and in-person modalities, using descriptive statistics and significance testing; (3) compare treatment outcomes for telephone and in-person modalities, using logistic regression and generalized estimating equations modeling; and (4) compare treatment outcomes as a function of traditional demographic and clinical predictor variables, as well as other SES-related contextual factors such as support from work and health care providers, using logistic regression modeling. Congruent with the goals and recommendations of the NCI Tobacco Control Research Branch and the Clinical Practice Guideline, this study will (1) describe variations in treatment based on sociocultural factors including novel information (a) on a community-based sample of tobacco users who access treatment and (b) about treatment utilization and outcomes relative to SES-related variables; the study will also (2) generate new information about applying, promoting, and disseminating evidence-based interventions in clinical and public health practice and contribute to tobacco control policy development. This study is especially important and timely given that the current population of smokers in the U.S. comprises largely lower SES groups, that 25% of the U.S. population resides in rural areas, that all 50 states now provide some form of publicly funded tobacco cessation assistance through quit lines, and that there is a dearth of information about the impact of sociocultural and clinical factors in publicly funded programs relative to treatment utilization and outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       PROJECT NARRATIVE Socioeconomic status (SES) clearly plays a significant role in tobacco use and the outcomes of tobacco dependence treatment, although we do not yet understand how the various factors involved, including education and income levels, exert their influence. In view of the largely lower SES of the current population of smokers in the U.S., the considerable size (25%) of the U.S. rural population, the provision by all 50 states of some form of publicly funded tobacco cessation assistance through quitlines, and the dearth of information about the impact of sociocultural and clinical factors in publicly funded treatment programs, the proposed study will examine the characteristics of participants in a statewide, six-session, evidence-based tobacco dependence treatment program delivered in two different treatment modalities: over the telephone and in person. The information to be gained from the analysis of this treatment program will help understand, address, and eventually eliminate disparities in tobacco use and in the outcomes of tobacco dependence treatment.            PROJECT NARRATIVE Socioeconomic status (SES) clearly plays a significant role in tobacco use and the outcomes of tobacco dependence treatment, although we do not yet understand how the various factors involved, including education and income levels, exert their influence.

"Enhancing tobacco cessation in the black community through DVD technology:PTF    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reducing tobacco-associated health disparities is a national public health priority. The Black community experiences higher rates of disease and death attributable to tobacco smoking than other racial/ethnic communities. Needed are interventions that combine public health and clinical psychology approaches, while addressing Black cultural and psychosocial factors. This study aims to (1) develop an innovative DVD-based cessation intervention, based on Pathways to Freedom (PTF), a community competent smoking cessation guide; and (2) conduct a pilot evaluation of the intervention. The DVD will also be guided by a clinic-based cessation program with demonstrated efficacy among Black smokers. The DVD will consist of 6 sections including: Education, Cessation, Relapse Prevention, Community Initiatives, Questions and Answers, and Medical Practice Settings. Smokers will be empowered to seek the assistance from sections that most closely match their needs and readiness to quit levels. The pilot evaluation will include both qualitative and quantitative methods. The qualitative evaluation will consist of semi- structured interviews with smokers, key stakeholders to explore themes related to the utility of intervention in the Black community, the ability of the intervention to address the heterogeneity of Black smokers, and dissemination potential. The quantitative pilot study will comprise a 2-arm design. Participants (N = 100) will be randomly assigned to view either the new PTF DVD or a Standard control DVD. Participants will be assessed at baseline, immediately post viewing the DVD, and at a 1-month follow-up. The primary outcome variables will be feasibility and process variables (e.g., intervention evaluations, readiness to quit, and cessation self-efficacy). Quit attempts will be the second outcome variable. The proposed intervention will utilize technology as a vehicle for health promotion in an underserved community, and develop a stand-alone intervention that can be used in multiple settings, such as community health clinics, primary care, quitlines, cessation clinics, and seminars/workshops.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrating public health and clinical psychology approaches to tobacco control has the potential to reduce racial health disparities. This study will develop an innovative evidence-based smoking cessation DVD targeting Blacks. The overall goal of this project is to increase the reach of cessation services into the Black community by developing a DVD-based protocol that will bring behavioral counseling into the homes of smokers.              Integrating public health and clinical psychology approaches to tobacco control has the potential to reduce racial health disparities.

"Stress as a determinant of smoking among sub-populations of Blacks in the U.S.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Caribbean blacks have lower prevalence of smoking compared to African Americans. However, the protective effect of being foreign born is short-lived as there is a positive relationship between smoking behavior and length of stay in the U.S. Using a nationally representative dataset, the goal of this research proposal is to further identify associations between migration and smoking behaviors and then assess the extent to which stress influences smoking behaviors among Caribbean Black adults in the United States. The specific aims of this application are: 1) to investigate the relationships between migration status and history, and smoking behaviors among Caribbean Blacks; 2) to evaluate the extent to which chronic stress, specifically financial and social stress, influences the associations between migration and smoking among Caribbean Blacks; and 3) to assess the extent to which ethnicity moderates the relationship between social stress and smoking among sub-groups of Blacks (Caribbean Blacks and African Americans). The proposed dissertation embodies NIH's mission of promoting research activities that ""extend healthy life and reduces the burdens of illness"", and aligns with NCI's goal ""to accelerate progress in cancer prevention"" and ""to preempt cancer at every opportunity."" Investigating the social and financial factors that contribute to smoking at different stages of migration status can increase our understanding of the relationships between stress and smoking. Findings from this application can inform public health initiatives and shape tailored smoking cessation interventions. Additionally, findings from theorized differential relationships between perceived discrimination and smoking behaviors of Caribbean compared to African Americans can help guide future research and public health policies. This application will utilize cross-sectional data from the National Survey of American Life (NSAL). NSAL is a large scale study that examines the effects of social, structural, political and economic determinants of health of sub-groups of Blacks. Inverse probability statistical weights that address the multi-stage sampling design and over-sampling of minority racial and ethnic groups will be used in developing ordinary linear regression and logistic regression models. Finally, as smoking is the leading cause of cancer, findings from these analyses can inform future research on the high rates of cancer-related deaths among Blacks PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Through my doctoral studies in the Society, Human Development and Health Department at the Harvard School of Public Health, I have been exposed to numerous research topics and given an analytic ""toolset"" to address health problems. This exposure has helped me refine my research interests, shape my career goals and form the development of this doctoral dissertation. My career goals are threefold. First, by conducting socially responsible and methodologically sound research, I seek to understand social experiences as determinants of the high cancer prevalence and mortality rates among minority and marginalized populations. Second, through clear, comprehensive and concise communication, I endeavor to increase the application of my research findings among the aforementioned communities. Third, I aspire to be a teacher to future generations of researchers. Several personal motivations and experiences underlie my career goals. My deep desire to understand the multidimensional social experiences of Black immigrants has been greatly shaped by the experiences of my family and me as immigrants to the U.S., 14 years ago. Furthermore, as a Black, female, immigrant, I have been exposed to differential treatment in various U.S. institutions, including education and healthcare, which have made me aware of my social status as a ""triple minority"".           ",Stress as a determinant of smoking among sub-populations of Blacks in the U.S.,8134921,F31CA142259,"['social stress ', ' Future Generations ', ' African Caribbean ', ' black carib ', ' black Caribbean ', ' Cigarette ', ' population health ', ' English Language ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Smoking Status ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Address ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Sampling ', ' Population ', ' experience ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Communication ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' base ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' migration ', ' stressor ', ' Time ', ' Family ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' next generation ', ' Training ', ' Research ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Smoking ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' United States ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Staging ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' pressure ', ' Documentation ', ' Shapes ', ' Female ', ' Chronic ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Measures ', ' Life ', ' Mission ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' interest ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Communities ', ' Prevalence ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Pattern ', ' Detection ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Health ', ' Probability ', ' career ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Data ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' protective effect ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Mentors ', ' Institution ', ' Weight ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' social ', ' American ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Immigrant ', ' Research Activity ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Human Development ', ' Ethnic group ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' teacher ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Prevention program ', ' sound ', ' cancer prevention ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Motivation ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' Financial Contribution ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Goals ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Minority ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' preempt ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Social status ', ' Race Relations ', ' ']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,F31,2011,15707,0.13700468104737354
"A family intervention to reduce smoking among Chinese and Vietnamese men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Family Intervention to Reduce Smoking in Chinese and Vietnamese Men Tobacco use disparities remain in subgroups of Asian men, particularly among those of low English proficiencies and immigrants from cultures where smoking prevalence is high, including Chinese- and Vietnamese-American men. The 2007 California Health Interview Survey estimates that nearly half (47.3 percent) of Asian male smokers in California are either Chinese or Vietnamese. Chinese and Vietnamese smokers underutilize state telephone quitline services, smoking cessation medications, and health providers' advice. Our recent research has shown the feasibility of recruiting Chinese smokers into a smoking cessation program through their families. Among Vietnamese men, having smoking-related family conflicts was a strong correlate with having intention to quit smoking and having quit successfully within the past 5 years. Involving smokers' families to promote intention to quit and to utilize cessation resources among Chinese and Vietnamese has enormous potential to reduce smoking in these populations. This study will use a mixed methods research design to develop and pre-test a family intervention using lay health worker (LHW) outreach to involve both smokers' families and smokers to promote smoking cessation in Chinese- and Vietnamese-American men. We aim to: 1) develop a culturally and linguistically appropriate family intervention targeting Chinese and Vietnamese smokers; and 2) conduct a pilot trial to examine feasibility of the proposed intervention. The development of the proposed family intervention will be guided by qualitative individual and dyadic interviews of Chinese and Vietnamese smokers and their families, community input (advisory boards and focus groups), and literature integrating 3 theories: Social Network Theory, Social Cognitive Theory, and the Transtheoretical Model. We will conduct a pilot trial using a one-group pre- and post- intervention design with 48 smoker-family dyads. Self-identified Chinese and Vietnamese males who smoke daily during the past 7 days and one family member from the same household will be recruited by LHW outreach. The primary outcomes measured are recruitment feasibility, attendance, and acceptability of the intervention. Secondary outcomes measured are comparisons of pre- and post-intervention changes in: family members' provision of support for their smokers, smokers' perceived support from their family, smokers' utilization of resources, quit intentions, and quit attempts made during the intervention period. The long-term goal is to effectively utilize family- based and outreach strategies that involve multiple individual, familial, and social levels to reduce smoking in hard-to-reach populations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health and economic consequences of cigarette smoking are well established. This project addresses gaps in knowledge about effective strategies for treating tobacco dependence in underrepresented populations where smoking prevalence is disproportionately high such as among Chinese- and Vietnamese-American men. The proposed study will examine the use of an innovative strategy that involves lay health worker outreach to mobilize the families and the smokers to promote smoking cessation in Chinese- and Vietnamese-American men.             The public health and economic consequences of cigarette smoking are well established.

"Culturally Specific Interventions and Acculturation in African American Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The importance of reducing tobacco-associated health disparities between African Americans and Caucasians cannot be understated. Researchers suggest that interventions need to be targeted to specific racial/ethnic groups (i.e., cultural tailoring); however, the literature examining the efficacy of cultural tailoring is equivocal. The inconsistent findings may be related to methodological weaknesses of past research, such as confounding intervention intensity and contact, or failure to recognize the heterogeneity of African Americans. Moreover, no studies have considered individual-difference factors affecting responses to culturally specific interventions, such as level of acculturation and ethnic identity. The investigators' preliminary studies indicate that standard (i.e., not culturally specific) cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for smoking cessation can be successful among African Americans compared to health education. Therefore, the investigators propose to test the incremental efficacy of culturally specific CBT (CS-CBT), and to examine individual differences in intervention response. The specific aims are: (1) To test the efficacy of a group-based, CS-CBT in African American smokers; and (2) to examine level of acculturation and ethnic identity as ethno-cultural predictors of smoking abstinence (exploratory). The investigators hypothesize main effects of (1) intervention type, such that the CS-CBT will produce greater abstinence rates compared to standard CBT; and (2) time, such that the greater abstinence rates in the CS-CBT condition will be maintained over time. No interactions are expected. The investigators also hypothesize that the intervention effects will be moderated by African American cultural factors (e.g., beliefs, values, and practices). Specifically, they hypothesize that lower acculturation levels and greater ethnic identity (i.e., a more traditional cultural orientation) will yield greater smoking abstinence rates among participants in the culturally specific condition, compared to the standard condition. The opposite association is hypothesized in the standard condition. The investigators will use a 2 (intervention type) x 4 (time) randomized design. Factor 1: intervention type (CS-CBT or standard CBT); factor 2: time (baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months). The former treatment represents the experimental condition and the latter will be an established control condition. All participants will receive transdermal nicotine patch therapy. The primary abstinence outcome will be 7-day point-prevalence abstinence (ppa); secondary outcomes will be 24- hour and 7-day ppa, and 28-day continuous abstinence. The investigators will also examine process outcomes, including utilization, study retention, and intervention evaluations. Answering the questions of (a) whether CS interventions lead to greater smoking abstinence compared to their traditional counterparts, and (b) for whom CS approaches are most beneficial will inform theories related to 'cultural sensitivity' and best practices for tobacco intervention among African Americans.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American smokers suffer disproportionately from smoking-associated diseases and deaths. This study will test a culturally specific cognitive-behavioral intervention for tobacco cessation by comparing it to standard cognitive-behavioral therapy. This study will also examine whether level of acculturation and ethnic identity predict who responds to either type of intervention. Thus, the investigators will address important, yet unanswered, questions with the goal of reducing health disparities.              African American smokers suffer disproportionately from smoking-associated diseases and deaths.

"Case Management for Reaching and Treating Underserved Latino Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K01 Application is to provide Dr. Ana-Paula Cupertino with the necessary research skills and publication track record to launch an independent career focused on reducing tobacco-related health disparities between Latinos and the majority U.S. population. Career Development activities include formal training as well as mentored research experiences. Her proposed training will expand her research repertoire to qualitative methods, tobacco dependence research, models for behavior change, cultural tailoring, and clinical trial design. A publication timeline lists manuscripts she will complete over the course of the award. The Research Plan consists of three studies over five years and focuses on smoking cessation among Latinos in safety net clinics. Study 1 is a multi-method case study, conducted in 3 safety net clinics, that employs qualitative and quantitative research methods. It will provide rich descriptions of how tobacco is currently addressed in clinics and insight into how best to integrate a case management intervention into clinic practices. Study 2 is a randomized pilot study of a case management intervention for promoting smoking cessation among Latinos in safety net clinics. It employs a novel approach for identifying not only smokers in clinics but also other smokers at home. Smokers (N=90) will be randomized to either case management CM or control. Participants in both CM and control will receive educational flyers describing smoking cessation resources available in the community. Participants assigned to CM will also receive telephone-based case management to enhance utilization of cessation resources. Main outcomes include resource utilization (utilization of the state tobacco quitline and smoking cessation pharmacotherapy) and smoking cessation at 6 months. Study 3 consists of structured interviews with Study 2 participants and safety net clinic health care providers. The interviews will identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement for the case management approach. This research will support Dr. Cupertino's development of an R01 application to test this intervention. This NCI K01 Mentored Career Development Award to Promote Diversity will facilitate Dr. Cupertino's growth into a productive, independent scientist dedicated to reducing health disparities among Latinos.           ",Case Management for Reaching and Treating Underserved Latino Smokers,8089238,K01CA136993,"['post intervention ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Abstinence ', ' Smoke ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' trial design ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Smoker ', ' Latino ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Health system ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Scientist ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' experience ', ' Clinic ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Testing ', ' Address ', ' programs ', ' Participant ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Measures ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Training ', ' skills ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Control Groups ', ' Communities ', ' behavior change ', ' Tobacco ', ' Patients ', ' Area ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' base ', ' TimeLine ', ' Family member ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Family ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Prevalence ', ' Characteristics ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Services ', ' Work ', ' Methods ', ' Structure ', ' career ', ' Procedures ', ' systems research ', ' Modeling ', ' Population ', ' Provider ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' improved ', ' Outcome ', ' Attitude ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Smoking ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Counseling ', ' Mentors ', ' Interview ', ' Award ', ' career development ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' quitline ', ' quit line ', ' safety net ', ' Build-it ', ' Case Management ', ' chronic care model ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Smoking and Health Research ', ' Smoking and Health ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2011,142967,0.17087419069926194
"Developing a Culturally Relevant Model of Smoking Cessation among Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Yessenia Castro, Ph.D., is a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Health Disparities Research at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). She is seeking five years of funding through the National Cancer Institute's Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to Promote Diversity (K01). Dr. Castro conducts research examining social, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and cultural determinants of smoking cessation in minority and underserved populations under the mentorship of Dr. David Wetter. MDACC provides an unusually rich training environment that includes an extraordinary number of workshops, seminars, and courses; outstanding opportunities for developing skills in grant writing, publication, and project management; and superb resources for assisting young investigators.     Dr. Castro's long term career goals are to serve as an independent, research-oriented faculty member in a university environment, and to develop a program of research focused on understanding culturally relevant influences of cancer risk behaviors, with a particular focus on smoking among Latinos. Such a program could improve smoking cessation interventions tailored for or targeted at Latinos, and ultimately aid in eliminating health disparities among this population.     In the current proposal, Dr. Castro delineates four short term goals to be achieved throughout the award period that are intended to serve as the foundation for an independent research career. These are: 1) accumulate a strong knowledge base in the social, cognitive, and affective mechanisms and processes involved in tobacco dependence and cessation among underserved adult populations; 2)extend her current knowledge of research on gender and race/ethnicity into the area of cancer prevention; particularly, smoking cessation among Latinos; 3) gain knowledge and experience in culturally competent community level research from a public health perspective, and; 4) learn the appropriate statistical methods and modeling techniques for evaluating complex longitudinal data. These goals will be achieved through a combination of: 1) rigorous formal coursework and directed readings; 2) numerous professional development experiences; 3) numerous project implementation, data analysis, and manuscript writing/publication experiences, and; 4) intensive mentoring by a team of highly successful scientists with diverse expertise, such that each mentor can provide invaluable guidance in achieving a specific short term goal, but most can advise about more than one goal.     The proposed research plan seeks to address the paucity of existing research addressing the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation among Latinos. Research in addictions and health behavior has identified a number of individual-level factors that are key determinants of smoking cessation including social/environmental, inter-/intrapersonal, and cognitive/affective factors. Emerging research suggests that many of the known determinants of smoking cessation may be of equal importance to minority smokers, but more research is needed in this area, as noted by several prominent publications including the Surgeon General's Report and the Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence Clinical Practice Guideline. Further, with the exception of data addressing the influence of acculturation on smoking prevalence, almost nothing is known about the effect of acculturation and other culturally relevant variables (e.g., acculturative stress, perceived discrimination) on the process of smoking cessation. Thus, the proposed project will utilize data from three longitudinal studies of Latino smokers to examine the impact of culturally relevant factors on mechanisms of smoking cessation. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a comprehensive conceptual model linking cultural factors to mechanisms of smoking cessation that is informed by previous work addressing the impact of culture on mental and physical health, socioeconomic status influences on health, and theories of addictive behaviors. Additionally, the project will evaluate specific, fine-grained hypotheses using data collected with state-of-the-science ecological momentary assessment techniques.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although Latinos are less likely to smoke, they exhibit more difficulty quitting, are less likely to seek or receive help with quitting, and are at high risk of developing tobacco related chronic illnesses. Further, very little is known about the determinants of smoking cessation among Latinos, or how factors specific to minority status influence determinants of cessation. Advancing knowledge in these areas would help to identify treatment targets, improve current smoking cessation interventions, and ultimately aid in eliminating health disparities among Latinos.           Although Latinos are less likely to smoke, they exhibit more difficulty quitting, are less likely to seek or receive help with quitting, and are at high risk of developing tobacco related chronic illnesses.

"En Pareja: A Latino couples intervention to help expectant fathers quit smoking    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking among Latino males living in the U.S. is a significant public health problem. Latinos smoke at the same rate as White males but are less likely than Whites to quit smoking, which can contribute to health disparities in life expectancy and increase mortality due to lung cancer. Clearly, smoking cessation programs for Latinos are needed. Some programs tested among Latinos have shown efficacy, but at the short-term only. Further, none has attempted to encourage cessation at a teachable moment: a time when cessation may seem more relevant. To reach this underserved population of smokers, we are proposing to conduct a teachable moment intervention trial for recently immigrated Latino smokers in Durham and Raleigh, North Carolina. We will conduct the interventions in Spanish. We will attempt to capitalize on the teachable moment of Latinas' pregnancy as an impetus for Latinos' cessation because pregnancy is a time when men might consider stopping smoking. Also, including the woman could help sustain cessation after the program is complete. Thus, we are intervening with Latino couples to help the men quit smoking. We have partnered with community leaders at El Centro Hispano, a community resource center for Latinos in Durham. We will develop an intervention based primarily on Social Cognitive Theory and the Teachable Moments Model. We will teach men smoking cessation skills, help improve men's self-efficacy and outcome expectancies for quitting, and teach the couples optimal ways to communicate to reduce the stress that comes with a new baby. With better communication, the couple may be able to work together better to help him quit smoking and stay quit. We are proposing to recruit pregnant Latino couples (n=420) into a two-arm smoking cessation intervention. The program will be culturally tailored to emphasize Latino cultural values that could contribute to higher cessation rates, namely familismo, a high value on the family, and personalismo, valuing warm personal relationships. The study arms are: Arm 1: Self-help smoking cessation guide vs. Arm 2: Couple-based smoking cessation counseling. We propose to survey couples face-to-face at five time-points: baseline, 28 weeks gestation, and 2, 6, and 12 months postpartum. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The smoking rate among Latino males is too high. Few effective programs reach and promote long term smoking cessation among Latino Spanish-speaking smokers. This intervention approaches Latinos when their wives are pregnant to increase motivation for quitting. The intervention includes Latinas and teaches the couples effective communication skills to help sustain cessation effects long term.           ",En Pareja: A Latino couples intervention to help expectant fathers quit smoking,8118620,R01CA127307,"['Expectancy ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Wife ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Couples ', ' risk perception ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Counseling ', ' Smoker ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Motivation ', ' Emotions ', ' North Carolina ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Country ', ' Smoking ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' pregnant ', ' male ', ' Fathers ', ' Smoke ', ' volunteer ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Life ', ' Relapse ', ' Address ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Modeling ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Health ', ' Woman ', ' improved ', ' Couples Therapy ', ' skills ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Testing ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Latino ', ' programs ', ' Site ', ' Time ', ' Outcome ', ' Mediating ', ' Work ', ' Language ', ' Family ', ' intervention effect ', ' Behavioral ', ' base ', ' Cognitive ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' arm ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Individual ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Stress ', ' Elements ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' self help ', ' Self Perception ', ' self knowledge ', ' self awareness ', ' Self view ', ' Self image ', ' Personal awareness ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' cultural values ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Central American ', ' South American ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' ']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,588744,0.16376482767247744
"Real-Time Measurement and Uptake of Carcinogens by Menthol Cigarette Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Menthol, the only cigarette additive that is actively marketed by manufacturers, is particularly favored by youth and ethnic/racial minorities. There is growing evidence that menthol cigarettes are starter products for youth, impede cessation, increase relapse following cessation and undermine social justice by the incessant targeted marketing of these products to communities of color. Tying menthol cigarette use to increased risk of tobacco-related diseases has been difficult. Generally, epidemiologic studies that have been used to try to make that connection have been inconclusive, whereas laboratory-based studies have been hampered by the inability to get established menthol or non-menthol smokers to use the opposite cigarette style for the extended periods necessary to compare classic measures of toxicity, and results obtained have been mixed. A major reason for this may lie with the commercial cigarettes that were used in these tests. Because cigarettes are so highly engineered, there are likely many differences between menthol and non-menthol cigarettes other than menthol levels. The investigators' previous work has resulted in some intriguing contrasts in menthol and non-menthol cigarettes, but it cannot be known if the differences were the result of the effects of mentholation alone, or the many other possible differences in the properties of commercial cigarettes. To adequately study the effect of mentholation of cigarettes, we need to test cigarettes that differ only in menthol content. The specific aims of this research are to determine the acute effects of smoking cigarettes that are equivalent except for levels of menthol. The over-all goal is to establish methods for testing which are valid without requiring prolonged periods of exposure and compliance with long-duration protocols. We will therefore characterize a set of cigarettes that are the same except for variation in menthol levels. The cigarettes are a commercial non-menthol cigarette that is mentholated at a low level and a high level, and Camel Crush, a non-menthol cigarette with a small menthol pellet in the filter which, when crushed, releases menthol into the filter. Chemical characterization of the cigarettes will be followed by real-time human toxicity measurements in a within-subjects design, to assess human exposure to select smoke-related toxins/carcinogens. Finally, to generate subject-specific smoke emissions and estimate uptake of smoke- related toxins/carcinogens, a smoking machine will be programmed to smoke the test cigarettes, and smoke emissions of each of the test cigarettes will be compared.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work has public health implications because, although African Americans smoke fewer cigarettes per day and tend to begin smoking later in life than do Euro-Americans, their smoking-related mortality from diseases associated with tobacco use is higher. The majority of African American smokers prefer smoking mentholated cigarettes compared to Euro-Americans smokers, and the preference for menthol cigarettes is even higher among younger smokers. Use of menthol cigarettes has been implicated as a cause of this disease disparity, but evidence from traditional epidemiologic and other studies has been weak. This study will determine if mentholation alone results in differences in smoking patterns, smoke emissions, biomarkers of exposure, and/or uptake of select toxins/carcinogens.              This work has public health implications because, although African Americans smoke fewer cigarettes per day and tend to begin smoking later in life than do Euro-Americans, their smoking-related mortality from diseases associated with tobacco use is higher.

"A Multi-State Asian-Language Quitline for Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study addresses a significant gap in the implementation of effective tobacco cessation services as recommended by the Community Guide to Preventive Services. The Guide recommends telephone counseling, or ""quitlines,"" as a key population-based tobacco control strategy. Currently, all 50 U.S. states have established quitlines. However, only one quitline offers direct counseling in Asian languages. Justifications for the absence of Asian-language services range from the lack of proven protocols for this population to the practical difficulty of staffing a program in multiple Asian languages. The project will translate an experimentally validated, Asian-language, smoking cessation telephone counseling protocol into a multi-state quitline operation. State health departments in California, Hawaii and Colorado will work with the researchers who developed and tested the protocol to create a practical dissemination model. The project aims to demonstrate that collaboration between researchers and policy makers will help to translate research results quickly into real world public health practice. The project involves both dissemination and implementation and has two overlapping phases. In the first phase, researchers will work with three states that are ready to adopt an Asian quitline. Together they will: (1) evaluate the dissemination success of a multi-state model for an Asian quitline in which each state promotes the quitline individually, but a centralized operation provides the counseling service; (2) examine the natural variation in implementation of promotional strategies by comparing smokers' responses to advertising messages in the context of state-specific cessation policies; and (3) test implementation fidelity by comparing the number and length of counseling sessions with those in California's original Asian trial, and with those of participating states' English and Spanish quitlines. In the second phase, researchers will work with the health departments in other states to encourage further dissemination. Specifically, they will: (1) examine the organizational readiness of other state health departments to adopt either the multi-state Asian quitline or to start their own Asian quitlines, and to assess their change in readiness from year 1 to year 3; (2) conduct in-depth interviews with representatives from selected state health departments, state quitline operators, and community organizations to determine their perceptions of barriers to adoption of Asian-language quitlines; and (3) set in motion a process for further dissemination by recruiting at least one additional state to join the multi-state Asian quitline by year 3 of the project. The proposed multi-state quitline project, if implemented successfully, can serve as a model for other states in providing behavioral cessation services to Asian-language smokers, helping to reduce disparities in access to effective treatment for these populations.           NARRATIVE The proposed project aims to translate a proven telephone counseling protocol for Asian language smokers into a multi-state quitline operation. This multi-state quitline can serve as a model for all states in the provision of behavioral counseling services to Asian populations, helping to reduce the disparity in access to treatment by these populations.",A Multi-State Asian-Language Quitline for Smokers,8138647,R18DP002106,[''],NCCDPHP,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R18,2011,448793,0.07853072609539292
"Race/Ethnicity, Menthol Cigarettes, and Biomarkers of Tobacco Use in the U.S.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main objective of this project is to evaluate the role of menthol cigarette use in explaining racial and ethnic differences in exposure to tobacco smoke components, among smokers in the United States (U.S.). Although Black smokers consume fewer cigarettes per day compared to White smokers, they have higher serum cotinine concentrations, are less likely to successfully quit smoking, and are at greater risk for some tobacco-related diseases. Several explanations have been proposed for these racial disparities, including differences in the prevalence of menthol cigarette use. Menthol has anesthetizing properties that could increase inhalation depth and tobacco intake per cigarette and it has been shown to impact nicotine metabolism, which may affect cotinine levels and nicotine dependency. In the proposed study, we will analyze the extensive smoking questionnaire and biomarker data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a series of nationally representative surveys of the U.S. population. We will combine five successive waves of data from the NHANES, conducted between 1999 and 2008. Serum cotinine, blood cadmium, and urine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are established biomarkers of tobacco use that are available in the NHANES database and will be used in the analysis. Serum cotinine is a specific biomarker of exposure to nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco. Cadmium and PAHs are highly toxic and carcinogenic tobacco components. While cotinine and PAHs reflect relatively recent exposure, cadmium can be used to characterize longer-term tobacco use. Using NHANES, we will describe the association of race/ethnicity and menthol cigarette use with biomarker concentrations using geometric mean ratios (and 95% CI) derived from regression models of log-transformed concentrations. In addition to crude analyses, models will be progressively adjusted for cigarettes smoked per day, sociodemographic characteristics, other smoking-related characteristics, and biomarker-specific determinants. Analyses will be conducted to account for the complex survey design structure and all estimates will be weighted to the U.S. population. This proposed research will utilize existing, publicly accessible data to examine racial/ethnic disparities in tobacco use biomarkers and the contribution of menthol cigarette use to these disparities. Examining differences in biomarkers of tobacco-related compounds will provide insight on the potential for menthol additives to contribute to nicotine addiction and long-term disease risk.        Project Narrative  Racial and ethnic differences have been reported in tobacco use, exposure, cessation, and disease risk. Menthol cigarette use has been proposed as one reason for these differences. The main objective of this project is to evaluate the role of menthol cigarette use in explaining racial and ethnic differences in smokers' exposure to chemicals in tobacco smoke.","Race/Ethnicity, Menthol Cigarettes, and Biomarkers of Tobacco Use in the U.S.",8100447,R03CA153959,"['Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Menthol ', ' Cyclohexanol, 5-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)- ', ' Smoke ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Cigarette ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons ', ' polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Tobacco ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Carcinogens ', ' oncogenic agent ', ' Oncogens ', ' Cancer Causing Agents ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Questionnaires ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' authority ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Whole Blood ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Exposure to ', ' American ', ' Accounting ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Series ', ' Affect ', ' Chemicals ', ' Structure ', ' Complex ', ' Counseling ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Population ', ' insight ', ' Grant ', ' Modeling ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Prevalence ', ' Risk ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Intake ', ' Breathing ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Data ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' success ', ' Smoker ', ' Regulation ', ' Weight ', ' meetings ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Characteristics ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Research ', ' Reporting ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Smoking ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' tobacco exposure ', ' United States ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Individual ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' biomarker ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Tobacco smoke ', ' Flavoring ', ' Flavoring Agents ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Cotinine ', ' Scotine ', ' 2-Pyrrolidinone, 1-methyl-5-(3-pyridinyl)-, (S)- ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2011,74916,0.18744501913866915
"Ecological Monetary Assessment of Smoking Cessation in Spanish-Speaking Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My goal is to become an independent investigator focusing on health disparities research with a particular interest in smoking cessation among minority populations. The specific aim of this project is to examine the mechanisms underlying the process of smoking cessation and relapse among Spanish-speaking smokers, and how these mechanisms are influenced by factors such as education and acculturation. The proposed study will address these issues by examining real-time, momentary changes in affect, self-efficacy, expectancies, motivation, craving, stress, and social support in the natural environment. Participants will be Spanish-speaking community smokers (N=140) recruited from the greater Houston area. Participants will be tracked for 3 contiguous weeks (from a week prior to their quit date through two weeks after their quit date) using state-of-the-science ecological momentary assessment (EMA) procedures (Stone & Shiftman, 2002), All participants will receive smoking cessation treatment consisting of nicotine patch therapy, self-help materials, and in-person counseling based on the Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence Clinical Practice Guideline (Fiore et al., 2000).To the best of our knowledge, this study will be the first among Spanish speaking smokers to evaluate the potential mechanisms underlying smoking cessation using palmtop administered EMA procedures to assess transient and context dependent constructs associated with smoking. Moreover, there is less research on how social factors influence smoking cessation as compared to smoking prevalence, and in particular, on how these factors influence specific mechanisms that affect cessation. Thus, this study will contribute unique knowledge to the field. Other unique contributions of this project include the longitudinal investigation of acute momentary phenomena, repeated assessment of daily experience, and analyses of trajectories overtime (both pre- and post-cessation) in a population of Spanish speaking smokers. The aims of the study are to 1) Examine the intrapersonal and contextual determinants/antecedents (e.g., craving, affect, self-efficacy, expectancies, stress, coping behavior, and social support) of daily experience, temptations to smoke, and smoking lapses among Spanish-speaking smokers during a quit attempt; and 2) Examine the influence of education and acculturation on these mechanisms of smoking relapse.          ",Ecological Monetary Assessment of Smoking Cessation in Spanish-Speaking Smokers,8067089,K07CA121037,"['Calculi ', ' Stone ', ' Biliary or Urinary Stones ', ' Motivation ', ' Smoking ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Expectancy ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Smoke ', ' Visit ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Procedures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Smoker ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Science ', ' Persons ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Investigation ', ' Minority ', ' Participant ', ' Relapse ', ' Communities ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Acute ', ' Stress ', ' social ', ' interest ', ' Knowledge ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Process ', ' Research ', ' Population ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Environment ', ' Affect ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' experience ', ' Address ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Time ', ' Goals ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' craving ', ' self help ', ' nicotine patch ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' Coping Behavior ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Counseling ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Personal Digital Assistant ', ' Pocket Personal Computer ', ' Pocket PCs ', ' Personal Digital Assistant Computer ', ' Palmtop computer ', ' Palmtop ', ' Palm-top computer ', ' Palm-top ', ' Palm Pilot ', ' PDA Computer ', ' Blueberry Device ', ' BlackBerry Device ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' smoking relapse ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K07,2011,126072,0.3013813899733984
"Financial Motivations to Quit Smoking and Prevent Related Economic Costs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal is to prevent future tobacco-related morbidity, mortality and medical care expenses in all smokers, but especially low-income smokers by adoption of novel, effective prevention measures delivered in non-medical venues. We aim to accomplish this by building the empirical basis and beginning to develop a more effective motivation to quit smoking based on a financial message to quit. Developing such a low-cost, population-based, intervention would expand the number of delivery settings. Such non-medical settings could include grocery stores, banks, check-cashing locations, tax preparation offices, etc., each of which may offer its own teachable moments related to costs of smoking. The financial motivation can be tailored to special populations, e.g., double your tax refund by quitting smoking or save money for your new baby. New venues and use of an effective, low-cost intervention will aid in reducing the smoking rates of low-income smokers and will address disparities in smoking, health and income. Using online web-based experiments and surveys, we will test whether the financial incentive to quit smoking is more effective than the health incentive. We will optimize the financial message by testing the impact of both priming the recipients to think about their financial situation and by tailoring to their specific smoking pattern. Based on the findings and our expertise in addiction treatment and behavioral economics, we will begin to develop a low-cost, intervention for low-income smokers. Effective, population-based approaches reduce the strain on the overburdened health care system, consistent with the emphasis on health care reform and providing prevention programs for low-income communities.  Aim 1: Determine whether the financial motivation to stop smoking is more effective than the health motivation. 1.a. Analyze which factors account for differences in the relative effectiveness of the financial or health message to quit smoking. Income of both the individual and the local community is a key factor, but age, gender, education, smoking status, other community measures, and state tobacco policies will be examined.  Aim 2: Determine whether priming smokers to consider financial or health issues makes the message to quit more effective. 2.a. Analyze which factors make different priming types more effective, e.g., examine differences by income, age, gender, education, smoking status, and state tobacco policies.  Exploratory Aim 3: Explore whether a tailored or general message is more effective. 3.a. Explore which factors account for differences in the effectiveness of message type with the goal of understanding for who each priming type is more effective; again income is a key factor but we will also examine other factors.  Exploratory Aim 4: Begin developing a scalable, population-based smoking cessation intervention based on recognizing the opportunity cost of smoking based on findings from above and by using our expertise in economic incentives for smokers.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our overriding goal is the prevention of future tobacco-related morbidity, mortality and medical care expenses in all smokers, and especially low-income smokers. We will examine the extent to which financial motivation to quit smoking is more powerful than the health motivation, especially for low-income individuals, and use our findings to begin developing interventions. This will pave the way for additional research that we believe will eventually help low-income smokers to quit smoking, and thus help combat disparities in smoking, health and income.           Our overriding goal is the prevention of future tobacco-related morbidity, mortality and medical care expenses in all smokers, and especially low-income smokers.

"Health Advocates as a Vehicle to Improve Treatment for Smokers in Public Housing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quitting smoking is the most important step that smokers can take to benefit their health. However, low-income smokers are less successful in quitting than higher-income smokers. If these socioeconomic disparities in smoking and smoking cessation rates persist, low-income smokers will bear an increasingly disparate burden of smoking-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, interventions to improve the rate of smoking cessation among low-income smokers are urgently needed. Smoking cessation treatment programs such as telephone quitlines and clinic-based programs exist but are underutilized, particularly by low-income smokers. We propose to conduct a group-randomized trial among public housing residents to test whether the use of resident Community Health Advocates with special training in smoking cessation (Tobacco Treatment Advocates (TTAs) can improve (1) utilization of quitlines and clinic-based programs and (2) smoking cessation rates among smokers in public housing. Twenty public housing developments (PHDs) in Boston will be randomly assigned to receive either the TTA intervention or enhanced standard care, with 250 smokers recruited for each condition. The intervention period for each participant will last 6 months, with final outcome assessment 6 months later. At intervention PHDs and TTAs will have 7-9 interactions with smokers to motivate them to use a treatment program, assist in determining which program best meets their needs, proactively connect smokers to programs, address logistical problems and other barriers to program participation, reinforce and augment counseling messages, encourage full utilization of programs including adherence to medication, and provide social support for quitting during and after treatment. Participants at control PHDs will meet once with a TTA who will provide them with culturally-appropriate self-help materials and information on smoking cessation services available through the Quitline and clinic-based programs. The primary outcomes for the study will be (1) utilization of Quitline or clinic-based cessation services (including dose of treatment), and (2) 7-and 30-day biochemically-verified smoking abstinence measured at 3, 7, and 12 months. Data sources for outcomes, as well as hypothesized mediators and moderators, will include quitline and clinic records, TTA records, and questionnaires administered at four time points. A cost-effectiveness evaluation of the cost per additional quit will provide information on the potential for disseminability.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Quitting smoking is the most important step that smokers can take to benefit their health, but low-income smokers are less successful in quitting than higher-income smokers. Interventions to improve the rate of smoking cessation among low-income smokers are urgently needed, or else these smokers will bear an increasingly disparate burden of smoking-related disease and death.

"Innovation for Smoke-Free Homes: Real-Time Feedback    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) is a significant health risk, especially to young children. More than 50 percent of children's SHSe occurs at home and children in low-income households are more likely to be exposed to SHS. Thus, home-based interventions are needed to protect children from SHSe. This is the first efficacy study to test whether children's home SHSe can be reduced by using innovative SHS particle monitors to provide real-time feedback to household residents plus brief advice/praise. This study will test the efficacy of immediate feedback and brief advice/praise on low-income families' ability to reduce children's exposure to nicotine, as measured by cotinine assays, reduce smoking in the home, and establish home smoking bans. Learning theory and pilot data suggest that real-time feedback from the monitor plus brief advice will prompt and reinforce SHSe reduction behaviors. Four hundred families from Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) programs in San Diego, California will be recruited. Households will be randomly assigned to an experimental group that receives continuous real-time feedback from a SHS particle monitor plus feedback-related brief advice/praise to reduce their child's exposure, or to a usual care control group where the particle monitor delivers no feedback. During the intervention phase, monitors in households of the experimental group will produce warning lights and beeps when SHS is detected. The primary specific aims are to: 1) Determine the differential group change in SHSe levels, as measured by child cotinine assays, due to real-time monitor feedback and brief advice; 2) Determine the differential group change in the establishment of home smoking bans; and 3) Validate differential change in particle measures of SHSe using nicotine dosimeters and child urine cotinine assays. The exploratory aims are to: determine theoretical moderators (e.g., child's health) of the effect of brief advice plus feedback; assess the effects of theoretical mediators (e.g., establishment of home smoking bans and other social contingencies) of change in SHSe; explore the dynamic nature of SHSe by examining the continuous particle monitor records over months to identify social contexts and micro- environments in the home as precise targets for intervention (e.g., smoking location, nonsmoker locations, and social interactions while smoking); assess the differential changes in tobacco use and SHSe by racial/ethnic group and by single v two-parent families to increase understanding of disparities for tobacco control; and obtain suggestions from families to enhance future use of the monitors. This is also the first large-scale test of a new technology in residential tobacco control, where real-time and telemetry feedback to investigators will both enable immediate feedback from light and sound alerts to families and inform investigators of smoking events or reduction in smoking events that warrant advice or praise. Thus, this application opens a new direction for future innovative studies using novel technology to advance reduction of SHSe in a range of micro-environments.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) is a significant health hazard for adults and children, especially the medically vulnerable. There is no risk-free level of SHSe and cumulative exposure can lead to pulmonary diseases and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Millions of U.S. children are exposed at home. This is the first study to test an innovative particle monitor to provide real-time feedback (lights/sounds) to encourage parents to reduce young children's SHSe in their home.           Secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) is a significant health hazard for adults and children, especially the medically vulnerable.

"Culturally Targeted & Individually Tailored Smoking Cessation Study: LGBT Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goals are to increase smoking cessation in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) smokers and to understand the processes related to cessation and relapse in this underserved population. Conducted in two phases, the primary aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of a culturally targeted intervention versus a non-targeted intervention on smoking cessation outcomes in LGBT smokers. Further aims are to determine the effect of the ALA-CT intervention on individually mediated predictors of cessation and to explore the underlying cultural and psychosocial mechanisms through which the ALA-CT intervention has an impact (differential or not) on smoking cessation. In Phase I, we will use focus groups and a pilot trial to establish the cultural appropriateness and acceptability of the targeted elements of the intervention. In Phase 2, we will conduct a randomized smoking cessation trial to compare for the first time the efficacy of the American Lung Association's 'Freedom from Smoking Program' (ALA-FFS). Culturally targeted (ALA-CT) and Non-Targeted (Standard ALA-FFS) to LGBT smokers. The ALA-CT will consist of 7 culturally targeted (psychosocial and cultural) group counseling sessions combined with nicotine replacement and peer support. The contrast condition will be smokers who receive the non-targeted ALA-FFS program, nicotine replacement and peer support. The primary smoking cessation outcome will be point prevalence abstinence, i.e., no smoking, not even a puff, for previous 7 days, and will be assessed by Timeline Follow-Back derived measures for prolonged abstinence and point prevalence quit rates. Reported outcomes will be objectively verified [Carbon monoxide (CO) testing] at 1 month, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months follow-up to determine short and longer- term cessation outcomes. We will control for demographic variables that have known associations with smoking outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate the benefits of culturally targeted smoking cessation intervention for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender smokers.

"Optimizing Treatment for Brazilian Smokers through Community-Based Primary Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  By 2030, over 8 million people will die annually from tobacco, and 80% of these deaths will occur in developing countries. Many countries are attempting to contravene this trend by becoming signatories to the World Health Organization's international tobacco treaty-the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). Helping smokers quit is a core article of the FCTC. Although Brazil provides universal coverage for evidence-based tobacco treatments, it continues to have disparities in tobacco prevalence and access to treatment. The twofold purpose of this project is to 1) conduct a research project to understand and enhance access to tobacco treatment for Brazilian smokers, and 2) build a research collaboration between the U.S. and Brazil. The research project involves collaborating with community-based primary care clinics in Juiz de Fora, Brazil to achieve the following specific aims: 1) create a representative registry of smokers to determine tobacco prevalence and attitudes toward treatment; 2) describe health care provider perspectives on how best to reach low-income smokers; 3) develop and pilot test a community agent intervention to enhance access to tobacco treatment services. The Parent R01 for this project tests the effectiveness of telemedicine to increase access to evidence-based tobacco treatment among rural Anglo and Latino smokers in the U.S. through rural primary care facilities. The project also relies on a K-Award that tests the effects of a U.S.-based lay health worker intervention designed to increase access to tobacco treatment among unban Latinos. The project utilizes the multiple-P.I. mechanism to take advantage of the complementary strengths of the Principal Investigators of these projects. The project will be conducted in collaboration with Brazilian P.I. Dr. Oscarina da Silva Ezequiel and her staff at the Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora (UFJF). Research capacity building activities include formal course offerings, mentored research projects, and community lectures designed to build knowledge and skills for conducting applied clinical research. The project addresses a significant global health problem and it is a highly relevant project for Brazil, which has a large population of very poor smokers. It also capitalizes on the unique structure of the Brazilian health care system to identify and link every smoker in the population to existing services. As such, it represents a paradigm shift from reactive to proactive treatment. Research project findings will be used to support an application for a large scale, definitive trial of the pilot intervention. If effective, the approach could achieve significant reductions in tobacco-related morbidity and mortality in Brazil and provide a model for population- based intervention internationally.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The twofold purpose of this project is to 1) enhance access to tobacco treatment for Brazilian smokers, and 2) build a research collaboration between the U.S. and Brazil. If effective, the project will provide a model for increasing access to tobacco treatment internationally and will strengthen the capacity of Brazilian researchers to conduct applied clinical research.            PROJECT NARRATIVE The twofold purpose of this project is to 1) enhance access to tobacco treatment for Brazilian smokers, and 2) build a research collaboration between the U.S. and Brazil.

"Community-Partnered Tobacco Control in Underserved Dominican Republic Communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The globalization of the tobacco epidemic poses significant morbidity and mortality burdens, with the brunt of impact increasingly borne by low-middle income countries. Research partnerships between investigators from high-income countries with well developed tobacco control research programs and their counterparts in low-middle income countries are needed to effectively address this global public health crisis. The Dominican Republic (DR) is a key site that mirrors the trends in Latin America: it is a low-middle income tobacco growing country with significant tobacco use and high levels of secondhand smoke exposure, and it is at a very early stage of tobacco control. The proposed project will assess baseline knowledge, attitudes, exposures, and behaviors regarding tobacco use and secondhand smoke, provide a randomized controlled trial of community-partnered interventions around secondhand smoke and tobacco cessation, and develop and implement a dissemination plan for national and regional impact and translation of methods and results to other underserved groups as appropriate. A multimethod assessment approach will be used, to include qualitative community assessments (RAPs), a series of quantitative surveys (household surveillances, community and smoker cohort surveys, and health care provider surveys), and a biomarker assessment of secondhand smoke exposure. Eight economically disadvantaged communities will be randomized to intervention or control conditions in a lagged treatment design; interventions will be developed and implemented based on the evidence base from other countries and from a current DR trial, and on input from national and local DR workgroups using a community partnered approach. The intervention is hypothesized to decrease tobacco use rates, increase the number of smokefree homes, denormalize smoking, increase awareness of and change attitudes regarding tobacco use and secondhand smoke risks, decrease exposure to secondhand smoke, and increase health care provider intervention in intervention- relative to control communities, with differences by geographic and demographic characteristics to be examined. The project will also engage international, national, and local DR workgroups to maintain communication of findings to key partners, host a national DR tobacco control conference with regional representation, and develop other action steps for local and regional dissemination of findings and evidence based interventions, resources, and infrastructures. Finally, the project will coordinate with the University of Rochester Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute for translation of current evidence based approaches and methodologies for implementation in the DR, and to explore whether any methodologies or interventions from the proposed trial in the DR can be translated to underserved groups in the United States. Effectively engaging early stage low-middle income countries in tobacco control research will be critical to reducing tobacco use and the burden of tobacco-caused illnesses globally. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tobacco use and tobacco-caused illnesses and death are increasing in developing countries globally, so it is critical to study these countries in order to effectively address the tobacco epidemic. The proposed project will test the effectiveness of community- based interventions for secondhand smoke and quitting smoking in eight underserved communities in the Dominican Republic. The project will also partner with communities and national and international groups to determine whether the methods and interventions from this study in the Dominican Republic can also be used to help other countries in the region and underserved groups in the United States.              Project Narrative Tobacco use and tobacco-caused illnesses and death are increasing in developing countries globally, so it is critical to study these countries in order to effectively address the tobacco epidemic.

"Yale SCOR on Gender-Sensitive Treatment for Tobacco Dependence     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Yale-SCOR is bringing together leading basic and clinical science experts to establish an interdisciplinary, translational, cross-species program of research aimed at identifying novel therapeutics to address the critical health disparity that female smokers face. Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States. Women, compared to men, have poorer rates of smoking cessation, exacerbated health risks, and FDA-approved medications for smoking cessation may not be as effective for women or have emerging limits due to side effects. However, few attempts have been made to develop gender-sensitive smoking cessation treatments. The considerable body of data suggesting that women are more likely to smoke to regulate negative affect and stress while men are more likely to smoke for the reinforcing properties of nicotine suggests an important direction in the development of a new approach to smoking cessation treatments. Using both preclinical and clinical strategies, our interdisciplinary team will probe te noradrenergic system's effects on stress-reactivity and nicotine reinforcement -hypothesizing that (a) different brain systems modulated by noradrenergic activity are activated by smoking in women and men, and (b) guanfacine (an alpha-2a noradrenergic agonist) can preferentially target these gender-sensitive systems to improve smoking cessation outcomes. Using a translational approach with an interdisciplinary team effort, we are proposing three projects that will have inter-related and shared goals, with each providing unique contributions to the development of gender-sensitive therapeutics. This new application will catalyze Yale's significant resources to support interdisciplinary and translational science in women's health to pursue extremely timely scientific findings that could represent a breakthrough in our understanding of treatments for a public health problem that affects millions daily. Our specific aims and objectives of the Yale-SCOR are to:    AIM 1: Evaluate the role of the noradrenergic system and its interactions with cholinergic and dopaminergic systems, in stress-induced smoking relapse and nicotine-based reinforcement, and use these findings to inform and expedite the development of gender-sensitive therapeutics for smoking cessation.    AIM 2: Mentor junior investigators in conducting interdisciplinary translational research on tobacco use and women's health through training opportunities, including ""clerkships"" with SCOR PIs, and pilot funding.    AIM 3: Be a national resource to invigorate and galvanize the study of sex and gender differences in relation to smoking by providing expert consultation; supporting faculty training awards; mining national data on gender, smoking and health outcomes to inform health policy; and expanding our current program of local and national community outreach.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Women compared to men, have poorer rates of smoking cessation and exacerbated health risks yet few attempts have been made to develop gender-sensitive smoking cessation treatments. This research will contribute to the public health by providing a neurobiologically-informed approach to the development of gender-sensitive therapeutics for smoking cessation, mentoring the next generation of interdisciplinary and translational researchers, and providing a national resource for women's health and tobacco use.              Women compared to men, have poorer rates of smoking cessation and exacerbated health risks yet few attempts have been made to develop gender-sensitive smoking cessation treatments.

"Developing a Culturally Relevant Model of Smoking Cessation among Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Yessenia Castro, Ph.D., is a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Health Disparities Research at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). She is seeking five years of funding through the National Cancer Institute's Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to Promote Diversity (K01). Dr. Castro conducts research examining social, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and cultural determinants of smoking cessation in minority and underserved populations under the mentorship of Dr. David Wetter. MDACC provides an unusually rich training environment that includes an extraordinary number of workshops, seminars, and courses; outstanding opportunities for developing skills in grant writing, publication, and project management; and superb resources for assisting young investigators.     Dr. Castro's long term career goals are to serve as an independent, research-oriented faculty member in a university environment, and to develop a program of research focused on understanding culturally relevant influences of cancer risk behaviors, with a particular focus on smoking among Latinos. Such a program could improve smoking cessation interventions tailored for or targeted at Latinos, and ultimately aid in eliminating health disparities among this population.     In the current proposal, Dr. Castro delineates four short term goals to be achieved throughout the award period that are intended to serve as the foundation for an independent research career. These are: 1) accumulate a strong knowledge base in the social, cognitive, and affective mechanisms and processes involved in tobacco dependence and cessation among underserved adult populations; 2)extend her current knowledge of research on gender and race/ethnicity into the area of cancer prevention; particularly, smoking cessation among Latinos; 3) gain knowledge and experience in culturally competent community level research from a public health perspective, and; 4) learn the appropriate statistical methods and modeling techniques for evaluating complex longitudinal data. These goals will be achieved through a combination of: 1) rigorous formal coursework and directed readings; 2) numerous professional development experiences; 3) numerous project implementation, data analysis, and manuscript writing/publication experiences, and; 4) intensive mentoring by a team of highly successful scientists with diverse expertise, such that each mentor can provide invaluable guidance in achieving a specific short term goal, but most can advise about more than one goal.     The proposed research plan seeks to address the paucity of existing research addressing the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation among Latinos. Research in addictions and health behavior has identified a number of individual-level factors that are key determinants of smoking cessation including social/environmental, inter-/intrapersonal, and cognitive/affective factors. Emerging research suggests that many of the known determinants of smoking cessation may be of equal importance to minority smokers, but more research is needed in this area, as noted by several prominent publications including the Surgeon General's Report and the Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence Clinical Practice Guideline. Further, with the exception of data addressing the influence of acculturation on smoking prevalence, almost nothing is known about the effect of acculturation and other culturally relevant variables (e.g., acculturative stress, perceived discrimination) on the process of smoking cessation. Thus, the proposed project will utilize data from three longitudinal studies of Latino smokers to examine the impact of culturally relevant factors on mechanisms of smoking cessation. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a comprehensive conceptual model linking cultural factors to mechanisms of smoking cessation that is informed by previous work addressing the impact of culture on mental and physical health, socioeconomic status influences on health, and theories of addictive behaviors. Additionally, the project will evaluate specific, fine-grained hypotheses using data collected with state-of-the-science ecological momentary assessment techniques.        Although Latinos are less likely to smoke, they exhibit more difficulty quitting, are less likely to seek or receive help with quitting, and are at high risk of developing tobacco related chronic illnesses. Further, very little is known about the determinants of smoking cessation among Latinos, or how factors specific to minority status influence determinants of cessation. Advancing knowledge in these areas would help to identify treatment targets, improve current smoking cessation interventions, and ultimately aid in eliminating health disparities among Latinos.

"Innovation for Smoke-Free Homes: Real-Time Feedback    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) is a significant health risk, especially to young children. More than 50 percent of children's SHSe occurs at home and children in low-income households are more likely to be exposed to SHS. Thus, home-based interventions are needed to protect children from SHSe. This is the first efficacy study to test whether children's home SHSe can be reduced by using innovative SHS particle monitors to provide real-time feedback to household residents plus brief advice/praise. This study will test the efficacy of immediate feedback and brief advice/praise on low-income families' ability to reduce children's exposure to nicotine, as measured by cotinine assays, reduce smoking in the home, and establish home smoking bans. Learning theory and pilot data suggest that real-time feedback from the monitor plus brief advice will prompt and reinforce SHSe reduction behaviors. Four hundred families from Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) programs in San Diego, California will be recruited. Households will be randomly assigned to an experimental group that receives continuous real-time feedback from a SHS particle monitor plus feedback-related brief advice/praise to reduce their child's exposure, or to a usual care control group where the particle monitor delivers no feedback. During the intervention phase, monitors in households of the experimental group will produce warning lights and beeps when SHS is detected. The primary specific aims are to: 1) Determine the differential group change in SHSe levels, as measured by child cotinine assays, due to real-time monitor feedback and brief advice; 2) Determine the differential group change in the establishment of home smoking bans; and 3) Validate differential change in particle measures of SHSe using nicotine dosimeters and child urine cotinine assays. The exploratory aims are to: determine theoretical moderators (e.g., child's health) of the effect of brief advice plus feedback; assess the effects of theoretical mediators (e.g., establishment of home smoking bans and other social contingencies) of change in SHSe; explore the dynamic nature of SHSe by examining the continuous particle monitor records over months to identify social contexts and micro- environments in the home as precise targets for intervention (e.g., smoking location, nonsmoker locations, and social interactions while smoking); assess the differential changes in tobacco use and SHSe by racial/ethnic group and by single v two-parent families to increase understanding of disparities for tobacco control; and obtain suggestions from families to enhance future use of the monitors. This is also the first large-scale test of a new technology in residential tobacco control, where real-time and telemetry feedback to investigators will both enable immediate feedback from light and sound alerts to families and inform investigators of smoking events or reduction in smoking events that warrant advice or praise. Thus, this application opens a new direction for future innovative studies using novel technology to advance reduction of SHSe in a range of micro-environments.        Secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) is a significant health hazard for adults and children, especially the medically vulnerable. There is no risk-free level of SHSe and cumulative exposure can lead to pulmonary diseases and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Millions of U.S. children are exposed at home. This is the first study to test an innovative particle monitor to provide real-time feedback (lights/sounds) to encourage parents to reduce young children's SHSe in their home.

"American Indian mHealth Smoking Dependence study (PQ4)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Northern Plains American Indians have the highest tobacco use compared with other American Indians and non-Hispanic Whites. Notably, the rate for tobacco related cancers also are higher among Northern Plains American Indians as compared to American Indians living in other regions and for non-Hispanic Whites living in the Northern Plains and elsewhere in the US. Although awareness of these elevated rates of tobacco-related cancers is well known throughout American Indian communities, Northern Plains American Indian adults continue to use tobacco. In addition, Northern Plains American Indian patients with cancer continue to smoke despite knowing that this behavior is related to cancer recurrence, new cancers and other chronic illnesses.  Rapid City Regional Hospital's (RCRH) mission is to reduce cancer mortality among American Indians in the Northern Plains. In 2002, Dr. Petereit, the PI for this project, developed the Walking Forward Program which is designed to address cancer disparities among Western South Dakota tribes. To accomplish this, Community Research Representatives have been hired to work with the reservation-based Cheyenne River Sioux, Rosebud Sioux, and Pine Ridge Lakota Sioux and the Rapid City urban Indian community. This study will focus on American Indians living on the Cheyenne River, Rosebud and Pine Ridge Reservations.  The proposed project, ""American Indian mHealth Smoking Dependence Study (PQ4),"" is designed to answer the research question, ""Why don't Northern Plain American Indians alter tobacco use behaviors known to increase the risk of cancer?"" The study is based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and uses a phase- based framework. mHealth (mobile health), the use of wireless devices such as cell phones to provide health- related information, will facilitate attainment of project aims as it offers a low-cost, efficient way to provide health-related messages to rural and other populations. This will be feasible for this study as access to wireless technology is rapidly increasing among Northern Plains American Indians.  The specific aims for the study are: Aim 1: Measure factors that predict smoking behaviors among Northern Plains American Indians; Aim 2: Identify issues and risk factors related to smoking persistence and high relapse behaviors, regardless of knowledge about smoking hazards, among Northern Plains American Indians; and Aim 3: Using the Theory for Planned Behavior, develop and adapt existing tobacco cessation interventions for use with adult Northern Plains American Indians who smoke cigarettes daily.  Outcome data will reveal predictors of intention to quit smoking, successful quit attempts, and relapse. Other social cognitive variables that ensure initial quit attempts are translated into longer term abstinence wil be identified. Study results will impact tobacco use among Northern Plains American Indians by providing insight into designing effective cessation interventions for this population.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The prevalence of smoking among Northern Plains American Indians is of epidemic proportion and on the rise. Consequently, they also have high cancer mortality rates.

"Understanding Disparities in Quitting in African American and White Smokers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial/ethnic differences in smoking are well documented; African Americans smoke fewer cigarettes per day than Whites but experience disproportionately greater smoking attributable morbidity and mortality. Well documented disparities also exist in smoking cessation with African Americans consistently quitting at lower rates than Whites. However, to-date, no adequately powered study, stratified on race, has been conducted to confirm this finding using a rigorous study design or to understand the mechanisms accounting for differential quit rates in African Americans relative to Whites. The objectives of this application are to 1) describe the differences in smoking cessation among AA and White smokers treated with varenicline, 2) identify the smoking, psychosocial, treatment process, and biological factors that independently explain the relationship between race/ethnicity and cotinine-verified 7-day abstinence in African American and White smokers, and 3) examine the side effect profile of varenicline by smoking level. These aims will be accomplished through a prospective cohort intervention study, stratified on race, age (< 40, > 40), and gender among 448 participants (224 African American, 224 White). All participants will receive 3 months of varenicline, the most effective of currently available smoking cessation medications, standard educational materials, and six sessions of smoking cessation counseling. This study is innovative. It will be the first known study to report on the use of varenicline in As, the first to examine varenicline in light smokers (<10 cpd) and among a wide range of smoking levels (3-20 cpd), the first head-to-head study, stratified on race, designed to prospectively compare pharmacotherapy in AAs versus Whites, and one of a few to explore mechanisms underlying disparities in quitting between AA and White smokers. The impact of these findings will be considerable, having ramifications for treatment, clinical practice, and policy. Significan knowledge will be gained about African American-White differences in quitting. Findings have the potential to improve tobacco use treatment by moving the field away from a generic focus on race/ethnicity toward a targeted focus on modifiable smoking, psychosocial, and treatment process factors most relevant to African Americans and to Whites.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans smoking fewer cigarettes per day and experience greater smoking-related disease and death, yet consistently quit smoking at lower rates than Whites. Little is known about the reasons for this disparity. This study will examine mechanisms explaining lower quit rates in African Americans relative to Whites and has the potential to significantly improve tobacco use treatment outcomes by identifying specific barriers and facilitators to quitting smoking for African Americans and for Whites.              African Americans smoking fewer cigarettes per day and experience greater smoking-related disease and death, yet consistently quit smoking at lower rates than Whites.

"Smoking Cessation Across Ethnic Groups in the US    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Racial/ethnic minorities bear a disproportionate burden of smoking-related diseases and exhibit higher rates of adult smoking and lower rates of quitting compared to Non-Hispanic Whites. Conceptualizations of smoking cessation have been based on Non-Hispanic White populations that are heavy or daily smokers. Racial/ethnic minority groups are more likely to be light and intermittent smokers, thus our understanding of smoking cessation should be examined for their applicability to such populations. Results from this project will have implications for the design and focus of smoking cessation programs for racial/ethnic minority groups.  We propose a secondary data analysis of the Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Survey and the California Tobacco Surveys. All analyses will be conducted for major racial/ethnic groups (African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Native Americans and Non-Hispanic Whites) and their subgroups (e.g., Korean Americans, Hispanics of Mexican descent, etc.), and by gender, age group, English language use, and educational level. Specific Aim 1: Among racial/ethnic minorities, conduct between-group and within-group analyses to better understand light and intermittent smoking in specific population segments. a) Provide an overview of light and intermittent smoking for racial/ethnic groups, especially specific subgroups  that do not have published research, which includes Asian Americans (e.g., Chinese Americans) and  Hispanics/Latinos of Mexican descent, and for African Americans in various geographic regions of the U.S. b) Investigate the effects of state-level tobacco control policy on the distribution of light and intermittent  smoking around the country over time for various racial/ethnic groups. Specific Aim 2: Research has shown that smokers can be categorized along a quitting continuum. We will report on the population distribution of smokers from different racial/ethnic groups along the quitting continuum. c) Hypothesis: The distribution of racial/ethnic minority smokers along the quitting continuum will be skewed  and appear as if they will experience greater quitting success in the future compared to Non-Hispanic  Whites. However, this will not be associated with actual higher rates of successful cessation. Such results would suggest that conceptualizations of the quitting process among minorities need to be reassessed. Specific Aim 3: Evaluate the applicability of smoking cessation treatment modalities to racial/ethnic minorities, particularly among those who are light and intermittent smokers. d) We will evaluate the prevalence of previously identified predictors of cessation, such as reducing  consumption, making prior quit attempts, use of cessation aids (e.g., quitlines, nicotine replacement  therapy), physician advice to quit, and the presence of complete home smoking bans across racial/ethnic  groups. We will then examine how these factors affect the smoking cessation process across groups.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposed study is to examine the process of quitting smoking among racial/ethnic minority groups to better understand why their quitting rates are lower than Non-Hispanic Whites given that minority groups are more likely to be lighter and non-daily smokers. The traditional understanding of the quitting process has been based on populations that were heavy and daily smokers so it might not be applicable to racial/ethnic minority groups. Our findings can have implications for how smoking cessation programs are designed for racial/ethnic minorities and lead to a reduction of disparities in smoking and smoking-related diseases.

"Correlates of Nicotine Dependence among Urban African American Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities continue to exist between and within populations and little is known about the causes of population differences observed in tobacco use, nicotine dependence, and related diseases. More importantly, an age-race paradox exists in which African American youth consistently report lower prevalence of tobacco use than their Caucasian counterparts, yet African American adult smokers suffer a disproportionate burden of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. Nicotine dependence is the most formidable impediment to quitting smoking among adolescents. Despite the recognition of the central role of nicotine dependence in smoking cessation, there is a paucity of information about how nicotine dependence is expressed among youth who smoke. For these reasons, researchers have called for additional research to address the insufficient understanding of and gap in the literature on adolescent nicotine dependence and its impact on cessation. Thus, I describe a plan to examine critical factors of nicotine dependence among urban African American youth utilizing individual and group (class) trajectory analysis (Study 1) as well as mixed methods research, including a validated measure of nicotine dependence, focus groups, and in-depth interviews (Study 2) to elucidate the complexities of adolescent nicotine dependence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans bear the greatest burden of death and illness due to cigarette smoking. Most adults began smoking as adolescents and nicotine dependence is a critical barrier in quitting smoking. This Award will allow me to examine the nicotine dependence experiences of both adults and youth to better understand how we can help African American youth quit smoking.

"A Randomized Control Trial of Tobacco Tactics for Operating Engineers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent research indicates that 35 percent of blue-collar workers in the U.S. currently smoke while only 20 percent of white-collar workers smoke. Over the last year, we have been working with heavy equipment operators, specifically Michigan Operating Engineers Local 324 Education Center, to study the epidemiology of tobacco use among this population. Having surveyed 498 Operating Engineers, the data show that smoking rates are high at 29% compared to 21% among the general population. While 57% of the tobacco users surveyed are interested in tobacco cessation services, novel strategies are needed to reach blue collar workers who are less likely to use proven tobacco cessation treatments such as counseling and/or pharmacotherapy. To this end, we have developed the Tobacco Tactics website for Operating Engineers. Responding to PA-09-130 Exploratory Grants for Behavioral Research in Cancer Control (R21), we are proposing a randomized control trial to pilot test the Web-based Tobacco Tactics intervention among Operating Engineers in Michigan compared to the state supported 1-800-QUIT-NOW telephone line, a well- known intervention available in the community (N=100). Both interventions will be offered during regularly scheduled safety training at the union hall and both will include counseling and provision of over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy. However, the Tobacco Tactics website will have humorous graphics tailored to Operating Engineers, tailored cessation feedback from the website, and follow up nurse counseling offered by multi-media options including phone and/or email, and/or e-community. Outcome evaluation will compare those randomized to the Tobacco Tactics Web-based intervention to those randomized to the 1-800-QUIT-NOW control condition on: a) 30-day and 6-month quit rates; b) cotinine levels; c) cigarettes smoked/day; d) number of quit attempts; and e) nicotine addiction. Process evaluation will compare the two groups on the: a) number contacts with intervention; b) minutes of exposure; c) medications used; and d) satisfaction. While we recognize that we are underpowered to obtain significant results of P<.05, this pilot study is designed to show whether the results are in the expected direction. Based on the outcome of this smaller R21, we will develop an RO1 for wider scale testing in conjunction with the International Environment Technology Testing Center which services Operating Engineers across North America (including US, Mexico, and Canada).        Because smoking is high among blue collar workers, we have developed a novel Tobacco Tactics website for Operating Engineers to be tested in a randomized control trial compared to the 1-800-QUIT-NOW state-supported telephone quit line (N=100). If this R21 pilot study shows promising results, we will develop an RO1 to test the Web-based Tobacco Tactics intervention in a larger randomized control trial in conjunction with the International Environment Technology Testing Center which services Operating Engineers across the US, Mexico, and Canada.

"Enhancing tobacco cessation in the black community through DVD technology:PTF    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reducing tobacco-associated health disparities is a national public health priority. The Black community experiences higher rates of disease and death attributable to tobacco smoking than other racial/ethnic communities. Needed are interventions that combine public health and clinical psychology approaches, while addressing Black cultural and psychosocial factors. This study aims to (1) develop an innovative DVD-based cessation intervention, based on Pathways to Freedom (PTF), a community competent smoking cessation guide; and (2) conduct a pilot evaluation of the intervention. The DVD will also be guided by a clinic-based cessation program with demonstrated efficacy among Black smokers. The DVD will consist of 6 sections including: Education, Cessation, Relapse Prevention, Community Initiatives, Questions and Answers, and Medical Practice Settings. Smokers will be empowered to seek the assistance from sections that most closely match their needs and readiness to quit levels. The pilot evaluation will include both qualitative and quantitative methods. The qualitative evaluation will consist of semi- structured interviews with smokers, key stakeholders to explore themes related to the utility of intervention in the Black community, the ability of the intervention to address the heterogeneity of Black smokers, and dissemination potential. The quantitative pilot study will comprise a 2-arm design. Participants (N = 100) will be randomly assigned to view either the new PTF DVD or a Standard control DVD. Participants will be assessed at baseline, immediately post viewing the DVD, and at a 1-month follow-up. The primary outcome variables will be feasibility and process variables (e.g., intervention evaluations, readiness to quit, and cessation self-efficacy). Quit attempts will be the second outcome variable. The proposed intervention will utilize technology as a vehicle for health promotion in an underserved community, and develop a stand-alone intervention that can be used in multiple settings, such as community health clinics, primary care, quitlines, cessation clinics, and seminars/workshops.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrating public health and clinical psychology approaches to tobacco control has the potential to reduce racial health disparities. This study will develop an innovative evidence-based smoking cessation DVD targeting Blacks.

"A family intervention to reduce smoking among Chinese and Vietnamese men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Family Intervention to Reduce Smoking in Chinese and Vietnamese Men Tobacco use disparities remain in subgroups of Asian men, particularly among those of low English proficiencies and immigrants from cultures where smoking prevalence is high, including Chinese- and Vietnamese-American men. The 2007 California Health Interview Survey estimates that nearly half (47.3 percent) of Asian male smokers in California are either Chinese or Vietnamese. Chinese and Vietnamese smokers underutilize state telephone quitline services, smoking cessation medications, and health providers' advice. Our recent research has shown the feasibility of recruiting Chinese smokers into a smoking cessation program through their families. Among Vietnamese men, having smoking-related family conflicts was a strong correlate with having intention to quit smoking and having quit successfully within the past 5 years. Involving smokers' families to promote intention to quit and to utilize cessation resources among Chinese and Vietnamese has enormous potential to reduce smoking in these populations. This study will use a mixed methods research design to develop and pre-test a family intervention using lay health worker (LHW) outreach to involve both smokers' families and smokers to promote smoking cessation in Chinese- and Vietnamese-American men. We aim to: 1) develop a culturally and linguistically appropriate family intervention targeting Chinese and Vietnamese smokers; and 2) conduct a pilot trial to examine feasibility of the proposed intervention. The development of the proposed family intervention will be guided by qualitative individual and dyadic interviews of Chinese and Vietnamese smokers and their families, community input (advisory boards and focus groups), and literature integrating 3 theories: Social Network Theory, Social Cognitive Theory, and the Transtheoretical Model. We will conduct a pilot trial using a one-group pre- and post- intervention design with 48 smoker-family dyads. Self-identified Chinese and Vietnamese males who smoke daily during the past 7 days and one family member from the same household will be recruited by LHW outreach. The primary outcomes measured are recruitment feasibility, attendance, and acceptability of the intervention. Secondary outcomes measured are comparisons of pre- and post-intervention changes in: family members' provision of support for their smokers, smokers' perceived support from their family, smokers' utilization of resources, quit intentions, and quit attempts made during the intervention period. The long-term goal is to effectively utilize family- based and outreach strategies that involve multiple individual, familial, and social levels to reduce smoking in hard-to-reach populations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health and economic consequences of cigarette smoking are well established. This project addresses gaps in knowledge about effective strategies for treating tobacco dependence in underrepresented populations where smoking prevalence is disproportionately high such as among Chinese- and Vietnamese-American men. The proposed study will examine the use of an innovative strategy that involves lay health worker outreach to mobilize the families and the smokers to promote smoking cessation in Chinese- and Vietnamese-American men.

"Feasibility of a Web-based Smoking Cessation Program for Vocational Students    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young adults and individuals in the lowest socioeconomic status (SES) categories report the highest rates of cigarette use and lowest rates of cessation. Although young adult smokers from backgrounds characterized by low SES are just as likely as their higher SES peers to attempt to quit smoking, they are less likely to use effective cessation treatments and less likely to actually quit. Individuals who occupy lower SES categories may not use effective cessation treatments due to lack of resources, assistance, and/or support. These individuals may also prefer to quit on their own, without the use of cessation aids. Web-based programs tailored to individual characteristics relevant to smoking cessation are one of the only types of cessation programs that are self-directed and can reach large numbers of smokers for very little cost. Yet, research examining smoking cessation using tailored web-based programs has focused almost exclusively on higher SES, White female smokers. The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of a tailored web-based cessation program for a racially/ethnically diverse sample of young adult smokers from lower SES backgrounds. Utilization and acceptability will be assessed by randomly assigning individuals either to a tailored web-based smoking cessation program based on social cognitive theory and studies of persuasive communications or to a control condition comprising a non-tailored web-based program providing evidence- based smoking cessation information. Both programs will be self-paced, allowing individuals to choose when and where they visit them. Participants will be smokers enrolled in post-secondary vocational/technical programs who want to quit smoking. The Specific Aims of the proposed project are to 1) Determine if young adult smokers from low SES backgrounds will use a tailored web-based cessation program and find it an acceptable means for quitting, 2) Identify the psychosocial variables relevant to young adult smokers from low SES backgrounds (e.g., financial stress, role overload, depressive symptoms) that contribute to variability in utilization and acceptability of the web-based program, and 3) Use individual interviews to determine how to increase utilization and acceptability of the tailored web-based program, and maximize its appeal to young adult smokers from low SES backgrounds. If successful, this project will lead to a multi-year R01 proposal testing the efficacy of a tailored web-based smoking cessation program in a larger randomized controlled trial. Results from Specific Aims 2 and 3 will be used to modify the existing web-based program to further tailor it to the needs of young adults occupying lower SES categories. The long-term goal of this research is to develop effective smoking cessation programs for young adults from low SES backgrounds that ultimately will decrease disparities in tobacco use and tobacco-related morbidity and mortality.

"Ecological Monetary Assessment of Smoking Cessation in Spanish-Speaking Smokers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My goal is to become an independent investigator focusing on health disparities research with a particular interest in smoking cessation among minority populations. The specific aim of this project is to examine the mechanisms underlying the process of smoking cessation and relapse among Spanish-speaking smokers, and how these mechanisms are influenced by factors such as education and acculturation. The proposed study will address these issues by examining real-time, momentary changes in affect, self-efficacy, expectancies, motivation, craving, stress, and social support in the natural environment. Participants will be Spanish-speaking community smokers (N=140) recruited from the greater Houston area. Participants will be tracked for 3 contiguous weeks (from a week prior to their quit date through two weeks after their quit date) using state-of-the-science ecological momentary assessment (EMA) procedures (Stone & Shiftman, 2002), All participants will receive smoking cessation treatment consisting of nicotine patch therapy, self-help materials, and in-person counseling based on the Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence Clinical Practice Guideline (Fiore et al., 2000).To the best of our knowledge, this study will be the first among Spanish speaking smokers to evaluate the potential mechanisms underlying smoking cessation using palmtop administered EMA procedures to assess transient and context dependent constructs associated with smoking. Moreover, there is less research on how social factors influence smoking cessation as compared to smoking prevalence, and in particular, on how these factors influence specific mechanisms that affect cessation. Thus, this study will contribute unique knowledge to the field. Other unique contributions of this project include the longitudinal investigation of acute momentary phenomena, repeated assessment of daily experience, and analyses of trajectories overtime (both pre- and post-cessation) in a population of Spanish speaking smokers. The aims of the study are to 1) Examine the intrapersonal and contextual determinants/antecedents (e.g., craving, affect, self-efficacy, expectancies, stress, coping behavior, and social support) of daily experience, temptations to smoke, and smoking lapses among Spanish-speaking smokers during a quit attempt; and 2) Examine the influence of education and acculturation on these mechanisms of smoking relapse.

"Implementing tobacco use treatment guidelines in dental public health clinics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. The 2008 Public Health Service Guideline (PHS), Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence provides strong evidence that brief advice combined with assistance such as counseling and pharmacotherapy, can significantly increase quit rates. Unfortunately, provider adherence to Guideline recommendations is poor. Inadequate implementation of the Guideline in practice settings, particularly those serving ethnic minorities and other vulnerable populations, has contributed to growing disparities in smoking prevalence and tobacco-related illness. This proposal addresses this research-to-practice gap by examining the effectiveness of three practical and highly replicable strategies for implementing evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of tobacco dependence in dental public health clinics. Dental providers have a credible and central role in providing tobacco cessation services. The majority of smokers see a dentist annually and tobacco use is a known risk factor for oral disease. Moreover, controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy and effectiveness of dental office-based cessation interventions. Yet dental care settings remain a relatively untapped venue for the treatment of tobacco dependence. In order to integrate evidence-based tobacco cessation treatment into routine dental practice, optimal implementation processes and strategies must be identified. We propose a 3-arm, cluster randomized controlled trial that will 1) Compare the effectiveness and cost of three promising strategies for implementation of the PHS tobacco use treatment guidelines: a) Staff training and current best practices (CBP); 2) CBP + provider performance feedback (PF) and 3) CBP + PF + provider reimbursement for delivery of tobacco cessation treatment (pay for performance) on provider adherence to recommended guidelines for tobacco use treatment; 2) Use a mixed-methods approach to examine potential theory-driven mechanisms at the organizational and provider level hypothesized to explain the comparative effectiveness of three strategies for implementation; and 3) Identify baseline organizational factors that influence the implementation of evidence-based tobacco use treatment practices in dental clinics. The trial will be conducted in 18 public dental care clinics and information about implementation outcomes and processes will be derived from multiple data sources (patient exit interviews, provider surveys and semi- structured interviews). Guided by a conceptual framework that emphasizes provider beliefs and organizational characteristics, we will identify factors that influence the implementation process in dental clinics. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to provide critical new knowledge to facilitate the widespread adoption, implementation, dissemination and sustained utilization of evidence-based tobacco use treatment strategies in dental practices across the U.S.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Despite the existence of effective treatments to support smoking cessation, cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Dental public health clinics afford a unique and relatively untapped opportunity to help those patients most in need of smoking cessation services. This study will test models of care that have promise to increase adoption and implementation of tobacco cessation clinical practice guideline into routine dental practice, an essential step toward achieving national health objectives and for ultimately reducing tobacco-related health disparities in the United States.             ",Implementing tobacco use treatment guidelines in dental public health clinics,8319851,R01CA162035,"['Belief ', ' Adoption ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' dental practice ', ' Dental General Practice ', ' Feedback ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Sources ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Clinics ', ' Dental Offices ', ' Dentists ', ' Interview ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Methods ', ' Institutes ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Recommendation ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Clinical ', ' Reminder Systems ', ' base ', ' Guidelines ', ' Process Measure ', ' United States ', ' Tobacco ', ' Smoking ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' Services ', ' Knowledge ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Smoker ', ' Clinic ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Dental ', ' Training ', ' Site ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Structure ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Performance ', ' Process ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' effectiveness research ', ' Characteristics ', ' trial design ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' cost ', ' Address ', ' Provider ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' financial incentive ', ' research into practice ', ' research to practice ', ' Outcome ', ' control trial ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' brief advice ', ' treatment strategy ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' provider intervention ', ' arm ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2012,700817,0.11810993165802262
"Culturally Targeted & Individually Tailored Smoking Cessation Study: LGBT Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goals are to increase smoking cessation in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) smokers and to understand the processes related to cessation and relapse in this underserved population. Conducted in two phases, the primary aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of a culturally targeted intervention versus a non-targeted intervention on smoking cessation outcomes in LGBT smokers. Further aims are to determine the effect of the ALA-CT intervention on individually mediated predictors of cessation and to explore the underlying cultural and psychosocial mechanisms through which the ALA-CT intervention has an impact (differential or not) on smoking cessation. In Phase I, we will use focus groups and a pilot trial to establish the cultural appropriateness and acceptability of the targeted elements of the intervention. In Phase 2, we will conduct a randomized smoking cessation trial to compare for the first time the efficacy of the American Lung Association's 'Freedom from Smoking Program' (ALA-FFS). Culturally targeted (ALA-CT) and Non-Targeted (Standard ALA-FFS) to LGBT smokers. The ALA-CT will consist of 7 culturally targeted (psychosocial and cultural) group counseling sessions combined with nicotine replacement and peer support. The contrast condition will be smokers who receive the non-targeted ALA-FFS program, nicotine replacement and peer support. The primary smoking cessation outcome will be point prevalence abstinence, i.e., no smoking, not even a puff, for previous 7 days, and will be assessed by Timeline Follow-Back derived measures for prolonged abstinence and point prevalence quit rates. Reported outcomes will be objectively verified [Carbon monoxide (CO) testing] at 1 month, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months follow-up to determine short and longer- term cessation outcomes. We will control for demographic variables that have known associations with smoking outcomes.

"En Pareja: A Latino couples intervention to help expectant fathers quit smoking    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking among Latino males living in the U.S. is a significant public health problem. Latinos smoke at the same rate as White males but are less likely than Whites to quit smoking, which can contribute to health disparities in life expectancy and increase mortality due to lung cancer. Clearly, smoking cessation programs for Latinos are needed. Some programs tested among Latinos have shown efficacy, but at the short-term only. Further, none has attempted to encourage cessation at a teachable moment: a time when cessation may seem more relevant. To reach this underserved population of smokers, we are proposing to conduct a teachable moment intervention trial for recently immigrated Latino smokers in Durham and Raleigh, North Carolina. We will conduct the interventions in Spanish. We will attempt to capitalize on the teachable moment of Latinas' pregnancy as an impetus for Latinos' cessation because pregnancy is a time when men might consider stopping smoking. Also, including the woman could help sustain cessation after the program is complete. Thus, we are intervening with Latino couples to help the men quit smoking. We have partnered with community leaders at El Centro Hispano, a community resource center for Latinos in Durham. We will develop an intervention based primarily on Social Cognitive Theory and the Teachable Moments Model. We will teach men smoking cessation skills, help improve men's self-efficacy and outcome expectancies for quitting, and teach the couples optimal ways to communicate to reduce the stress that comes with a new baby. With better communication, the couple may be able to work together better to help him quit smoking and stay quit. We are proposing to recruit pregnant Latino couples (n=420) into a two-arm smoking cessation intervention. The program will be culturally tailored to emphasize Latino cultural values that could contribute to higher cessation rates, namely familismo, a high value on the family, and personalismo, valuing warm personal relationships. The study arms are: Arm 1: Self-help smoking cessation guide vs. Arm 2: Couple-based smoking cessation counseling. We propose to survey couples face-to-face at five time-points: baseline, 28 weeks gestation, and 2, 6, and 12 months postpartum. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The smoking rate among Latino males is too high. Few effective programs reach and promote long term smoking cessation among Latino Spanish-speaking smokers. This intervention approaches Latinos when their wives are pregnant to increase motivation for quitting. The intervention includes Latinas and teaches the couples effective communication skills to help sustain cessation effects long term.

"Socioeconomic status and smoking exposure in Appalachia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Social inequalities are an important predictor of disease incidence, including cancer. Persons with low socioeconomic status (SES) have increased rates of lung and other tobacco-related cancers. Although smoking prevalence is higher in persons with lower levels of education and occupational status, smoking prevalence does not explain this excess risk. In prospective cohort studies, the associations between low SES and elevated lung cancer risk persist after adjustment for smoking amount and duration. The investigators' overall hypothesis is that the unaccounted increased risk in populations with lower SES is due to higher smoke exposure that cannot be accounted for by self-reported smoking habits. Their previous laboratory studies demonstrate that there is a wide degree of variation in biological exposure to tobacco smoke toxins and carcinogens per cigarette smoked. The investigators propose to conduct a community-based participatory study in the medically underserved area of Appalachian Pennsylvania to determine the relationship between SES and the dose of inhaled mainstream smoke and the dose of biological markers of tobacco smoke exposure. Specific aims are: Specific Aim 1. Determine whether SES is associated with smoking puffing behaviors including puff volume, duration, interval, and length of cigarette smoked. Specific Aim 2. Determine whether SES is associated with biomarkers of smoking exposure including salivary cotinine and expired carbon monoxide. This addresses the SES hypothesis using biological measures of dose in addition to environmental measures such as puffing dose. Specific Aim 3. Correlate environmental and biological measures of smoke exposure. This aim will determine whether levels of mainstream smoke exposure, as estimated by puffing profiles are determinants of the biological levels of cigarette smoke exposure, and whether this relationship differs by SES. This brings together aims 1 and 2 to comprehensively address the SES hypothesis. Specific Aim 4. Determine the effects of psychological stress, as assessed by psychological scales and salivary stress biomarkers, on smoking puffing parameters and salivary cotinine levels. The proposed research study will be conducted in Appalachia, Pennsylvania (PA), a NIH-designated medically underserved but socioeconomically diverse population. The investigators predict that lower SES is associated with higher smoke intake as determined by topography and smoke biomarkers, and that this finding will help to explain the long-observed patterns of lung cancer incidence disparities.        A major objective of cancer control efforts is to understand the causes of social inequalities in cancer rates. Cigarette smokers of lower socioeconomic status (SES) have increased rates of lung cancer and other tobacco-related diseases than smokers of higher SES. Because smoking is a modifiable behavior, findings that demonstrate more intensive smoking and greater exposure to tobacco smoke among low SES smokers may be helpful in developing more effective and targeted smoking control efforts.

"Financial Motivations to Quit Smoking and Prevent Related Economic Costs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal is to prevent future tobacco-related morbidity, mortality and medical care expenses in all smokers, but especially low-income smokers by adoption of novel, effective prevention measures delivered in non-medical venues. We aim to accomplish this by building the empirical basis and beginning to develop a more effective motivation to quit smoking based on a financial message to quit. Developing such a low-cost, population-based, intervention would expand the number of delivery settings. Such non-medical settings could include grocery stores, banks, check-cashing locations, tax preparation offices, etc., each of which may offer its own teachable moments related to costs of smoking. The financial motivation can be tailored to special populations, e.g., double your tax refund by quitting smoking or save money for your new baby. New venues and use of an effective, low-cost intervention will aid in reducing the smoking rates of low-income smokers and will address disparities in smoking, health and income. Using online web-based experiments and surveys, we will test whether the financial incentive to quit smoking is more effective than the health incentive. We will optimize the financial message by testing the impact of both priming the recipients to think about their financial situation and by tailoring to their specific smoking pattern. Based on the findings and our expertise in addiction treatment and behavioral economics, we will begin to develop a low-cost, intervention for low-income smokers. Effective, population-based approaches reduce the strain on the overburdened health care system, consistent with the emphasis on health care reform and providing prevention programs for low-income communities.  Aim 1: Determine whether the financial motivation to stop smoking is more effective than the health motivation. 1.a. Analyze which factors account for differences in the relative effectiveness of the financial or health message to quit smoking. Income of both the individual and the local community is a key factor, but age, gender, education, smoking status, other community measures, and state tobacco policies will be examined.  Aim 2: Determine whether priming smokers to consider financial or health issues makes the message to quit more effective. 2.a. Analyze which factors make different priming types more effective, e.g., examine differences by income, age, gender, education, smoking status, and state tobacco policies.  Exploratory Aim 3: Explore whether a tailored or general message is more effective. 3.a. Explore which factors account for differences in the effectiveness of message type with the goal of understanding for who each priming type is more effective; again income is a key factor but we will also examine other factors.  Exploratory Aim 4: Begin developing a scalable, population-based smoking cessation intervention based on recognizing the opportunity cost of smoking based on findings from above and by using our expertise in economic incentives for smokers.        Our overriding goal is the prevention of future tobacco-related morbidity, mortality and medical care expenses in all smokers, and especially low-income smokers. We will examine the extent to which financial motivation to quit smoking is more powerful than the health motivation, especially for low-income individuals, and use our findings to begin developing interventions. This will pave the way for additional research that we believe will eventually help low-income smokers to quit smoking, and thus help combat disparities in smoking, health and income.

"Measurement of Tobacco Use among South Asians in the U.S.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite marked health disparities among South Asians internationally compared to the U.S. population, little is known about the health status of South Asians residing in the U.S. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research on tobacco use behaviors in South Asians. Moreover, tobacco consumption is characterized by a large proportion of indigenous tobacco products, such as bidis, which are small brown hand-rolled cigarettes, and gutkha and paan masala, types of chew tobacco. These popular South Asian tobacco products are also readily available in ethnic enclaves in the U.S. In addition, South Asians are the second largest Asian group in the U.S. and among the fastest growing immigrant groups. Existing studies of tobacco use in South Asians in the U.S. are limited as they tend to be geographically restricted or focused only on cigarette smoking. However, studies conducted in the U.K. suggest that immigrant South Asians may have high rates of tobacco use and may continue use of their native tobacco products. This exploratory research proposal describes a plan to explore measurement issues in tobacco use surveillance of South Asians in the U.S. Accordingly, we will: 1) conduct focus groups to understand tobacco use among South Asians in the U.S., 2) develop and refine a survey instrument, which will undergo cognitive testing, to assess the prevalence of products used by South Asians, 3) implement a population-based split sample randomized survey to compare standard tobacco use measures and new questions developed to measure South Asian-specific tobacco products, and 4) explore the feasibility of a respondent driven sampling (RDS) approach to reach South Asians. Thus, the significance of this proposed research is its potential to improve tobacco surveillance methodologies and generate a better understanding of indigenous tobacco use among South Asian immigrants which is vital to informing and directing tobacco control efforts.          The purpose of this research project is to explore measurement issues in tobacco use surveillance of South Asians in the U.S. Thus, the significance of this proposed research is its potential to improve tobacco surveillance methodologies and generate a better understanding of indigenous tobacco use among South Asians which is vital to informing and directing tobacco control efforts.                ",Measurement of Tobacco Use among South Asians in the U.S.,8700997,R21CA164913,[''],NCI,RBHS-SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R21,2012,88006,0.07620900205974798
"Optimizing Treatment for Brazilian Smokers through Community-Based Primary Care   PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT By 2030, over 8 million people will die annually from tobacco, and 80% of these deaths will occur in developing countries. Many countries are attempting to contravene this trend by becoming signatories to the World Health Organization's international tobacco treaty-the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). Helping smokers quit is a core article of the FCTC. Although Brazil provides universal coverage for evidence-based tobacco treatments, it continues to have disparities in tobacco prevalence and access to treatment. The twofold purpose of this project is to 1) conduct a research project to understand and enhance access to tobacco treatment for Brazilian smokers, and 2) build a research collaboration between the U.S. and Brazil. The research project involves collaborating with community-based primary care clinics in Juiz de Fora, Brazil to achieve the following specific aims: 1) create a representative registry of smokers to determine tobacco prevalence and attitudes toward treatment; 2) describe health care provider perspectives on how best to reach low-income smokers; 3) develop and pilot test a community agent intervention to enhance access to tobacco treatment services. The Parent R01 for this project tests the effectiveness of telemedicine to increase access to evidence-based tobacco treatment among rural Anglo and Latino smokers in the U.S. through rural primary care facilities. The project also relies on a K-Award that tests the effects of a U.S.-based lay health worker intervention designed to increase access to tobacco treatment among unban Latinos. The project utilizes the multiple-P.I. mechanism to take advantage of the complementary strengths of the Principal Investigators of these projects. The project will be conducted in collaboration with Brazilian P.I. Dr. Oscarina da Silva Ezequiel and her staff at the Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora (UFJF). Research capacity building activities include formal course offerings, mentored research projects, and community lectures designed to build knowledge and skills for conducting applied clinical research. The project addresses a significant global health problem and it is a highly relevant project for Brazil, which has a large population of very poor smokers. It also capitalizes on the unique structure of the Brazilian health care system to identify and link every smoker in the population to existing services. As such, it represents a paradigm shift from reactive to proactive treatment. Research project findings will be used to support an application for a large scale, definitive trial of the pilot intervention. If effective, the approach could achieve significant reductions in tobacco-related morbidity and mortality in Brazil and provide a model for population- based intervention internationally.   PROJECT NARRATIVE The twofold purpose of this project is to 1) enhance access to tobacco treatment for Brazilian smokers, and 2) build a research collaboration between the U.S. and Brazil. If effective, the project will provide a model for increasing access to tobacco treatment internationally and will strengthen the capacity of Brazilian researchers to conduct applied clinical research.",Optimizing Treatment for Brazilian Smokers through Community-Based Primary Care,8305501,R03TW008723,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Attitude ', ' Brazil ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Dentists ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Continuance of education ', ' Continuing Education ', ' Faculty ', ' family medicine ', ' Family Practice ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Home Visits ', ' House Call ', ' Household ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Nurses ', ' Parents ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Recommendation ', ' Registries ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoke ', ' Social Workers ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Case Management ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Telemedicine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Rural ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Treaty ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Smoker ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Universal Coverage ', ' lectures ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' respiratory ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' graduate student ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' basica ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' trend ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' tobacco control ', ' home visit ', ' Home visitation ', ' pilot trial ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' service utilization ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' parent grant ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",FIC,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2012,55705,0.1450386935915908
"A Social Ecological Based Smoking Cessation Intervention in Public Housing   African American (AA) women in urban, poverty-stricken neighborhoods have high rates of smoking, difficulties with quitting, and disproportionate tobacco related health disparities. AA women who smoke are twice as likely to die from cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer as other ethnic groups. Assisting this underserved population to quit smoking is a national health priority. Recommendations call for more comprehensive, participatory, and multi-level approaches that address social context (i.e., culture, social networks, and neighborhoods) in lifestyle behavioral interventions.  The broad, long-term objectives of this research are to optimize smoking cessation outcomes and to reduce associated health disparities in AA women who live in Southeastern US public housing neighborhoods. Using a participatory and social ecological approach, the academic investigators, advisory board, and public housing residents have developed a multi-level intervention (a.k.a. Sister to Sister) that has demonstrated feasibility and potential effectiveness in increasing short-term cessation outcomes. The primary aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of this bundled intervention on long-term (6- and 12-month) cessation outcomes in women in public housing neighborhoods.  We will pair-match 14 public housing neighborhoods and randomly assign one neighborhood in each pair (7 per condition) to either a treatment condition (Sister to Sister) or a control condition. We project 203 smokers for treatment and 203 smokers for control, a total of 406 participants (29 per neighborhood), will be required at baseline to detect proposed treatment effects for the primary outcome of smoking cessation. Treatment participants will receive the 24-week, bundled Sister to Sister Intervention consisting of: a) individual level strategies with 1:1 community health worker contact to enhance smoking cessation self-efficacy and spiritual well-being; b) interpersonal level strategies with behavioral counseling in small peer groups to enhance social support; c) neighborhood level strategies with policy and counter-marketing campaigns led by a neighborhood advisory board; and, d) an 8-week supply of nicotine patches and study-specific written cessation materials. Control participants will receive written cessation materials at baseline (Pathways to Freedom) and mailed written cessation materials at weeks 6, 12, and 18. In accordance with community preferences, the control participants will be offered a delayed intervention at the end of the study. Secondary aims are to test the effect of intervention mediators (self-efficacy, spiritual well-being, social support, cessation resources) and moderators (perceived stress, social influences, social ties, neighborhood cohesion, neighborhood smoking prevalence, neighborhood stress) on cessation outcomes. Measures will be assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Demonstrating success with this socio-cultural, multi-level approach may lead to wide-scale dissemination and adoption, and decrease disparities of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality in AA females.   African American women in public housing neighborhoods have high rates of smoking and difficulties in quitting. Developing effective socio-culturally relevant health promotion interventions that facilitate positive health behaviors will be vital to the elimination of health disparities in this priority population.",A Social Ecological Based Smoking Cessation Intervention in Public Housing,8197231,R01HL090951,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Intracranial Vascular Disorders ', ' Intracranial Vascular Diseases ', ' Cerebrovascular Disease ', ' Brain Vascular Disorders ', ' Cerebrovascular Disorders ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Control Groups ', ' Scotine ', ' 2-Pyrrolidinone, 1-methyl-5-(3-pyridinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Cotinine ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Female ', ' Liberty ', ' Freedom ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Mails ', ' Marketing ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Peer Group ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Housing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Southeast US ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Sister ', ' Smoker ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' nicotine patch ', ' Life ', ' Salivary ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' preference ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' metropolitan ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' social stress ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Community Trial ', ' Community Health ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Abstinence ', ' treatment effect ', ' primary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' ']",NHLBI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2012,695803,0.07188482757794495
"The Influence of HIV Disease Events/Stages on Smoking Attitudes and Behaviors Abstract: While mortality attributable to AIDS-related diseases has decreased dramatically in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, the proportion of deaths attributable to other diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and cancer) has markedly increased. Thus, efforts to reduce morbidity and mortality attributable to these non-AIDS defining diseases represent an important public health priority. One approach to improve health outcomes for this population is to target health-risk behaviors, such as cigarette smoking. Existing evidence indicates that smoking prevalence is significantly elevated among persons living with HIV/AIDS. In addition, smoking is associated with numerous HIV-related adverse outcomes. Despite these findings, few efforts have been made to deliver cessation treatment to this population. Also lacking are efforts to explore the relationship between HIV disease events/stages and smoking. Thus, the overarching goal of this project is to prospectively explore the relationship between HIV disease events/stages, perceived impact of HIV, attitudes about smoking, and smoking behaviors. HIV disease events/stages (e.g., time of HIV diagnosis, progressive disease, and stable disease) will be evaluated as potential teachable moments for smoking cessation. Specifically, we will identify and recruit newly HIV-diagnosed smokers from a large, inner city HIV/AIDS care center serving a racially/ethnically diverse, medically indigent population. Participants will complete a computer-administered assessment designed to measure perceived impact of HIV, attitudes about smoking, and current smoking behavior at the time of study enrollment. In addition to traditional self-report measures, certain variables (e.g., perceived impact of HIV) will be assessed using ""implicit"" cognitive psychological measures, as considerable evidence suggests that both explicit and implicit measures yield unique information that predicts outcome. Participants will be followed for one year and asked to complete follow-up computer- administered assessments at three-month intervals. In addition to clinic administered assessments, participants will complete brief weekly phone assessments that will allow us to carefully track changes in perceived impact of disease and smoking behavior for the first three months of follow-up. Research staff will also conduct medical record reviews to document the timing and progression of disease (e.g., treatment failure, diagnosis of an HIV- or non-HIV related disease). This design will enable us to carefully track changes in smoking behavior over time, and to link these changes to both the course of HIV-disease and/or to participants' perceived impact of HIV. By identifying optimal time points for intervention, findings will have the potential to maximize the efficiency and efficacy of cessation treatments delivered in resource-limited settings. In addition, findings will be instrumental in identifying specific constructs that should be targeted for intervention, and will provide a strong foundation for the development of future cessation interventions targeting smokers living with HIV/AIDS. Project Narrative The proposed study will provide important information about the relationship between HIV-disease events/stages and smoking behavior among a low socio-economic status, racially/ethnically diverse population. Specifically, findings will identify potential teachable moments for cessation interventions in the course of HIV-disease, and will provide a strong foundation for the development of future cessation interventions targeting this population.

"Smoking Cessation Interventions and Program Availability for Drug and Alcohol Add    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of smoking among individuals seeking treatment for a co-occurring substance abuse condition is very high, between 70%-95% (Burling & Ziff, 1988; Fiore et al., 2000; Kozlowski et al., 1986; McCarthy et al., 2002). However, many drug treatment facilities do not encourage smoking cessation during treatment, even though patients are often show interest in quitting smoking. Research finds that not only are low income people more likely to smoke, but the resources for smoking cessation may not be as accessible as those who have higher income (Novotny & Giovino, 1998; MMRW, November 9, 2007; Barbeau et al., 2004; Honjo et al., 2006). Therefore, substance abuse treatment is a context where evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for smoking might have the best chance of reaching low-income smokers. Treating patient smoking concurrent with other drugs is important since research demonstrates that addiction to nicotine may cause changes in brain chemistry and structure which could trigger drug and alcohol cravings, decreasing the chance of prolonged sobriety (Britt & McGehee, 2008; Yeh et al., 2007). The proposed project pursues two objectives related to understanding the adoption, implementation, and sustainability (or conversely discontinuation) of EBTs for smoking in substance abuse treatment contexts. The first aim examines longitudinally the availability of EBTs for smoking among those seeking treatment for co-occurring substance abuse and explores the predictors of changes in service availability over time in treatment programs. Key categories of predictors include the percentage of low-income clients served by the treatment center, organizational and policy factors, and workforce characteristics. The second aim also uses a longitudinal design to examine the evidence-based clinical practice behaviors that counselors engage in with clients. This is important because individuals implement EBTs not organizations or treatment programs (Fixsen et al., 1995). Integrating theory and research from implementation science, public health, organizational change, substance abuse treatment, and health services delivery four categories of moderator variables are examined to understand why and under what conditions counselors are likely to engage clients in smoking cessation efforts with clients.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health-related risks of smoking make it a major public health concern, particularly in light of recent research suggesting that the addictive properties of nicotine are similar to that of opiates.

"CBPR to Reduce Tobacco Smoking among Residents of a Low-Income Urgan Setting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hugely disproportionate burden of death and disease borne by people of color and the poor is not a medical mystery, and its solution does not necessarily require high-tech interventions. Tobacco use is an excellent example because tobacco smoking is a substantial cause of death from five of the seven leading causes of death. Due to concerted public health efforts, smoking prevalence has been reduced by 30% over the last 15 years in the U.S. Yet not all have benefited equally in this great accomplishment. Most of our nation's educated and well-off individuals no longer smoke; the 21% of our adult population who continue to smoke are largely poor, undereducated, and underemployed.      The proposed R24 project ""CBPR to Reduce Tobacco Smoking among Residents of a Low-Income Urban Setting"" aims at reducing several health problems caused by or related to tobacco use among people of color and low-SES whites, through partnership with South West Baltimore community that will result in smoking cessation programs that are more effective and more culturally appropriate. Therefore, the specific aims for the proposed project are: (1) through CBPR and other rigorous scientific methods, develop, implement, and evaluate an intervention to reduce tobacco use that will be sensitive to the needs and characteristics of this community and produce a sustained reduction of tobacco smoking among 36% of the participants in the intervention; (2) to investigate specific marketing strategies that may affect consumption patterns; (3) to explore the ecological factors determining tobacco use and quitting behaviors in this community; and, (4) to implement information systems that will help the community track the scope and features of tobacco smoking, major risk and protective factors, in order to identify potential alternatives of action. The project is designed as Community Based Participatory Experimental Research, with mix quantitative and qualitative methods. Intense community involvement and active participation will be the core value of this proposed research. The effectiveness of interventions will be evaluated rigorously using individually tailored treatments with adaptive treatment strategies that use relatively new statistical approaches for effectiveness evaluations in community settings. ""Active"" and ""passive"" surveillance strategies will be used to analyze the scope, determinants, and dynamics of tobacco use in their community.

"Reducing socioeconomic disparities in tobacco dependence treatment outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tobacco use is a leading contributor to racial and socioeconomic health disparities in the US primarily due to an unequal burden of tobacco-related disease from a disproportionate share of smokers in lower socioeconomic (SES) groups in which minorities, particularly African Americans, are disproportionately represented.1-5 Although deemed effective for all smokers,6 the standard cognitive-behavioral treatment for tobacco dependence is significantly less effective for lower SES smokers.7-15 Tobacco dependence treatment, however, has the potential to reduce racial and socioeconomic disparities in achieving long-term abstinence by proactively providing our most at-risk smokers with the specific treatment components they need to achieve abstinence through the existing extensive treatment delivery system.16, 17 Our preliminary studies indicate that in addition to several socio-cultural barriers to engaging in treatment,18 there are several key factors associated with socioeconomic disparities in relapse rates and thus treatment outcomes. These factors include: stress, negative affect, smoking in response to negative affect, delay discounting, locus of control, impulsiveness, exposure to smokers in the environment, and treatment utilization (see Table 1).19, 20 Based on this and other evidence, our overall goal is to revise the standard treatment with specific, evidence-based, cognitive-behavioral strategies to address these key factors as well as target and tailor the approach to more fully meet the needs of lower SES and minority smokers, thereby reducing treatment outcome disparities. We expect: 1) The revised treatment (RT) to reduce socioeconomic disparities in treatment outcomes, and 2) Participants treated with the RT to demonstrate more improvement on each of the key factors associated with disparities than those treated with standard treatment (ST). The specific aims include: 1) Complete a revised draft of a widely utilized standard treatment manual that addresses each of the key factors with treatment components. This aim is partially accomplished (see Appendix for preliminary draft). 2) Using the PEN-3 Model,21-23 target and tailor the daft RT to more fully represent the experiences of smokers who are of lower SES and /or of minority status, particularly African American smokers. 3) Pilot test the targeted/tailored draft RT with three treatment groups (n=5-10 per group) to assess understandability and acceptability and to ensure that it can be delivered in the same timeframe as the ST. 4) Compare the effects of SES on treatment outcomes with socioeconomically and racially diverse participants treated with ST (n=110) and RT (n=110) in a randomized treatment design. 5) Compare the effects of treatment condition on each of the key factors. This innovative approach refines, improves upon, and applies theoretically derived and empirically supported concepts and strategies. If effective at reducing treatment outcome disparities, the manual-driven RT will be easily disseminable as a ""new"" standard, having a sustained and powerful impact on the field and contributing to a reduction in the magnitude of the present tobacco-related racial and socioeconomic health disparities.           Tobacco use is a leading contributor to racial and socioeconomic health disparities in the US primarily due to an unequal burden of tobacco-related disease from a disproportionate share of smokers in African American and lower socioeconomic (SES) groups. Unlike many other health risk behaviors, tobacco-related health disparities are increasing despite a large treatment network of free telephone and in-person counseling services, perhaps due to significant disparities in treatment outcomes. The goal of this project is to revise the standard treatment for tobacco dependence to address key factors associated with treatment outcome disparities and more fully meet the needs of lower SES and African American smokers thereby reducing socioeconomic disparities in tobacco dependence treatment outcomes, halting the alarming increase in tobacco-related health disparities, and reducing a leading cause of racial and socioeconomic health disparities in the US.            ",Reducing socioeconomic disparities in tobacco dependence treatment outcomes,8575111,R01MD007054,"['tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' ']",NIMHD,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R01,2012,318772,0.14034220125699043
"Using CBPR to Implement Smoking Cessation in an Urban American Indian Community    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) have the highest smoking rates any ethnic group in the United States, at 41% versus 24% for African Americans and Whites. They also have the lowest quit rates of any group, at 8-10% at 6 months. Due to its long cultural significance as a sacred plant, the entirely negative portrayal of tobacco in most smoking cessation programs is inappropriate, leaving programs unsuccessful. In 2003, AI/AN patients from Haskell Health Center requested a culturally-appropriate smoking cessation program, causing the center director to contact the University of Kansas Medical Center Department of Preventive Medicine. Since that time, the larger AI/AN community in Kansas and Missouri has been working collaboratively with KUMC on the development of a culturally-tailored smoking cessation program, as well as several other projects. In 2006, KUMC and several community-based organizations formed the American Indian Health Research and Education Alliance, dedicated to improving the health of AI/AN using community-based participatory research methods. The culturally-tailored smoking cessation program that began the partnership, All Nations Breath of Life (ANBL), has now been developed and pilot tested and is ready for implementation in the urban AI/AN community of the Kansas City Metroplex. Our pilot data are promising; with a 25% quit rate and 80% participant retention at 6-months post-baseline. We will address the following specific aims: (1) To create appropriate infrastructure (personnel, space, supplies, leadership commitment) for the Heart of America Indian Center to serve as the primary site for implementation of ANBL; (2) To examine the acceptability and feasibility of implementing ANBL in an urban AI/AN community; (3) To estimate the effectiveness of ANBL in an urban AI/AN community; and (4) to identify factors that enhance dissemination of ANBL and contribute to program success or failure. We hypothesize that participants in ANBL will quit smoking at a higher rate than currently reported in the literature for the best available programs. In addition, we will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the program to help determine its sustainability. If this project is successful, ANBL can be disseminated to other AI/AN communities to help them quit smoking. By reducing smoking rates in this community, we can ultimately reduce their leading cause of cancer death (lung cancer) and their leading cause of overall death, cardiovascular disease.

"Enhancing cancer outreach for low-income adults with innovative smoking cessation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence indicates that the prevalence of current cigarette smoking among adults in the US has dropped below 20%. While this drop is encouraging, smoking still represents the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the US. Moreover, smoking prevalence is significantly higher among certain population groups, such as those with low levels of education and those living at, or below the poverty level. Therefore, efforts to target these underserved populations with efficacious smoking cessation treatments represents a vital public health effort. The overarching goal of this group-randomized trial is to design and evaluate a novel smoking cessation program targeted to uninsured and underinsured individuals. Key elements of the proposed study will be the use of an established network of community sites (e.g., community centers and churches) and a mobile unit, enabling us to reach individuals confronted with significant barriers to utilizing more traditional smoking cessation treatment approaches.       Specific aims of the study will be to: 1) Compare the efficacy of three smoking cessation interventions targeting community based low income uninsured and underinsured individuals in a group-randomized trial. The interventions will include a Standard Care (SC) approach, consisting of brief advice to quit smoking, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and self-help written materials; an Enhanced Care (EC) approach, consisting of the standard care components plus a single health feedback and motivational interviewing counseling session and a cell phone-delivered text/graphical messaging component; and an Intensive Care (IC) approach, consisting of all SC and EC components plus a series of 11 cell phone-delivered proactive counseling sessions and a cell phone-delivered text/graphical messaging component; 2) Evaluate the role of quit motivation, nicotine withdrawal, risk perception, self- efficacy, social support, and negative affect as potential mediators of smoking abstinence; and 3) Compare the cost-effectiveness of the three treatment conditions.       We believe that of the three conditions, the IC will most successfully address the needs of low-income smokers for several reasons. First, the IC program will be personalized, individualized, and equipped with an intensive, extended counseling and support module provided over the cell phone. Second, the program will combine three intervention components featuring high potential for maintaining support and motivation to quit and prevent relapse. Third, the IC intervention makes use of cell phone technology - an approach that has demonstrated feasibility and efficacy among low-income smokers in previous research conducted by the investigative team. The proposed study offers a number of features (proximity of services to the place of residence, provision of cell phones, etc.) that are likely to reduce treatment barriers while enhancing participant recruitment and retention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will use an existing network of community sites and a mobile unit to deliver smoking cessation treatment to a multiethnic population of uninsured and underinsured adults living in the greater Houston, Texas metropolitan area. The treatments will include components such as brief advice to quit, nicotine patch, written materials, motivational interviewing/health feedback counseling, text/pix messaging, and proactive cell phone counseling.

"Health Advocates as a Vehicle to Improve Treatment for Smokers in Public Housing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quitting smoking is the most important step that smokers can take to benefit their health. However, low-income smokers are less successful in quitting than higher-income smokers. If these socioeconomic disparities in smoking and smoking cessation rates persist, low-income smokers will bear an increasingly disparate burden of smoking-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, interventions to improve the rate of smoking cessation among low-income smokers are urgently needed. Smoking cessation treatment programs such as telephone quitlines and clinic-based programs exist but are underutilized, particularly by low-income smokers. We propose to conduct a group-randomized trial among public housing residents to test whether the use of resident Community Health Advocates with special training in smoking cessation (Tobacco Treatment Advocates (TTAs) can improve (1) utilization of quitlines and clinic-based programs and (2) smoking cessation rates among smokers in public housing. Twenty public housing developments (PHDs) in Boston will be randomly assigned to receive either the TTA intervention or enhanced standard care, with 250 smokers recruited for each condition. The intervention period for each participant will last 6 months, with final outcome assessment 6 months later. At intervention PHDs and TTAs will have 7-9 interactions with smokers to motivate them to use a treatment program, assist in determining which program best meets their needs, proactively connect smokers to programs, address logistical problems and other barriers to program participation, reinforce and augment counseling messages, encourage full utilization of programs including adherence to medication, and provide social support for quitting during and after treatment. Participants at control PHDs will meet once with a TTA who will provide them with culturally-appropriate self-help materials and information on smoking cessation services available through the Quitline and clinic-based programs. The primary outcomes for the study will be (1) utilization of Quitline or clinic-based cessation services (including dose of treatment), and (2) 7-and 30-day biochemically-verified smoking abstinence measured at 3, 7, and 12 months. Data sources for outcomes, as well as hypothesized mediators and moderators, will include quitline and clinic records, TTA records, and questionnaires administered at four time points. A cost-effectiveness evaluation of the cost per additional quit will provide information on the potential for disseminability.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Quitting smoking is the most important step that smokers can take to benefit their health, but low-income smokers are less successful in quitting than higher-income smokers. Interventions to improve the rate of smoking cessation among low-income smokers are urgently needed, or else these smokers will bear an increasingly disparate burden of smoking-related disease and death. Using residents from low-income communities, such as public housing, to help their fellow residents quit smoking may be an effective method to increase the rate of smoking cessation.

"The Effects of Smoking and Expectancy on ERP Measures of Attentional Bias    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The focus of this proposal is to provide the applicant with the skills, experience, and mentoring to become an independent researcher with a focus on understanding the neurobehavioral determinants of nicotine dependence. The training plan outlined in this proposal will allow me to expand my skills by providing an opportunity to become proficient in the use of event-related potential (ERP) electroencephalography (EEC) techniques to study attentional and emotional mechanisms related to nicotine dependence. This work will be conducted at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, where I will be mentored by distinguished scientists in the field of nicotine dependence. This multidisciplinary team will provide oversight of my research and training experiences by providing specific expertise in the areas of neurobehavior, ERP, attentional biases, and gender differences of smoking. The focus of the Research Plan is to gain a greater understanding of the attentional biases of smokers in order to expand our knowledge of how drug and affective cues help to maintain neural sensitization to drugs of abuse. The proposed study would be the first to evaluate the attentional bias of smokers using a within-subjects balanced placebo design, allowing for the separation of the effects of nicotine from the effects of smoking cues on ERP attentional response to smoking and affective cues. The specific aims of this proposal are (a) to distinguish the effects of nicotine's pharmacological properties from those resulting from learned associations on the attentional distraction by smoking and affective cues in dependent smokers, (b) to determine whether gender differences exist in the attentional distraction by smoking and affective cues, (c) to determine whether the expectation of imminent tobacco use increases the attentional distraction by smoking and affective cues, and (d) to assess whether ERP measures of attentional distraction by smoking and affective cues correlate with traditional self-reported measures of nicotine dependence, craving, and affect.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Smoking dependence is thought to be maintained by the brain's attentional bias towards cues in the environment that remind the dependent invidual of smoking. This study will use event-related potential (ERP) EEG technology to investigate these attentional biases and circumstances that provoke them.

"Health Advocates as a Vehicle to Improve Treatment for Smokers in Public Housing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Quitting smoking is the most important step that smokers can take to benefit their health. However, low-income smokers are less successful in quitting than higher-income smokers. If these socioeconomic disparities in smoking and smoking cessation rates persist, low-income smokers will bear an increasingly disparate burden of smoking-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, interventions to improve the rate of smoking cessation among low-income smokers are urgently needed. Smoking cessation treatment programs such as telephone quitlines and clinic-based programs exist but are underutilized, particularly by low-income smokers. We propose to conduct a group-randomized trial among public housing residents to test whether the use of resident Community Health Advocates with special training in smoking cessation (Tobacco Treatment Advocates (TTAs) can improve (1) utilization of quitlines and clinic-based programs and (2) smoking cessation rates among smokers in public housing. Twenty public housing developments (PHDs) in Boston will be randomly assigned to receive either the TTA intervention or enhanced standard care, with 250 smokers recruited for each condition. The intervention period for each participant will last 6 months, with final outcome assessment 6 months later. At intervention PHDs and TTAs will have 7-9 interactions with smokers to motivate them to use a treatment program, assist in determining which program best meets their needs, proactively connect smokers to programs, address logistical problems and other barriers to program participation, reinforce and augment counseling messages, encourage full utilization of programs including adherence to medication, and provide social support for quitting during and after treatment. Participants at control PHDs will meet once with a TTA who will provide them with culturally-appropriate self-help materials and information on smoking cessation services available through the Quitline and clinic-based programs. The primary outcomes for the study will be (1) utilization of Quitline or clinic-based cessation services (including dose of treatment), and (2) 7-and 30-day biochemically-verified smoking abstinence measured at 3, 7, and 12 months. Data sources for outcomes, as well as hypothesized mediators and moderators, will include quitline and clinic records, TTA records, and questionnaires administered at four time points. A cost-effectiveness evaluation of the cost per additional quit will provide information on the potential for disseminability.

"Community-Partnered Tobacco Control in Underserved Dominican Republic Communities  The globalization of the tobacco epidemic poses significant morbidity and mortality burdens, with the brunt of impact increasingly borne by low-middle income countries. Research partnerships between investigators from high-income countries with well developed tobacco control research programs and their counterparts in low-middle income countries are needed to effectively address this global public health crisis. The Dominican Republic (DR) is a key site that mirrors the trends in Latin America: it is a low-middle income tobacco growing country with significant tobacco use and high levels of secondhand smoke exposure, and it is at a very early stage of tobacco control. The proposed project will assess baseline knowledge, attitudes, exposures, and behaviors regarding tobacco use and secondhand smoke, provide a randomized controlled trial of community-partnered interventions around secondhand smoke and tobacco cessation, and develop and implement a dissemination plan for national and regional impact and translation of methods and results to other underserved groups as appropriate. A multimethod assessment approach will be used, to include qualitative community assessments (RAPs), a series of quantitative surveys (household surveillances, community and smoker cohort surveys, and health care provider surveys), and a biomarker assessment of secondhand smoke exposure. Eight economically disadvantaged communities will be randomized to intervention or control conditions in a lagged treatment design; interventions will be developed and implemented based on the evidence base from other countries and from a current DR trial, and on input from national and local DR workgroups using a community partnered approach. The intervention is hypothesized to decrease tobacco use rates, increase the number of smokefree homes, denormalize smoking, increase awareness of and change attitudes regarding tobacco use and secondhand smoke risks, decrease exposure to secondhand smoke, and increase health care provider intervention in intervention- relative to control communities, with differences by geographic and demographic characteristics to be examined. The project will also engage international, national, and local DR workgroups to maintain communication of findings to key partners, host a national DR tobacco control conference with regional representation, and develop other action steps for local and regional dissemination of findings and evidence based interventions, resources, and infrastructures. Finally, the project will coordinate with the University of Rochester Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute for translation of current evidence based approaches and methodologies for implementation in the DR, and to explore whether any methodologies or interventions from the proposed trial in the DR can be translated to underserved groups in the United States. Effectively engaging early stage low-middle income countries in tobacco control research will be critical to reducing tobacco use and the burden of tobacco-caused illnesses globally.  Project Narrative Tobacco use and tobacco-caused illnesses and death are increasing in developing countries globally, so it is critical to study these countries in order to effectively address the tobacco epidemic. The proposed project will test the effectiveness of community- based interventions for secondhand smoke and quitting smoking in eight underserved communities in the Dominican Republic. The project will also partner with communities and national and international groups to determine whether the methods and interventions from this study in the Dominican Republic can also be used to help other countries in the region and underserved groups in the United States.",Community-Partnered Tobacco Control in Underserved Dominican Republic Communities,8320976,R01CA132950,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Dominican Republic ', ' Epidemic ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Institutes ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Language ', ' Latin America ', ' Learning ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' PAHO ', ' Pan American Health Organization ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Smoking ', ' Societies ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' experience ', ' international center ', ' cohort ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' secondhand smoke ', ' second hand smoke ', ' environmental tobacco smoke exposure ', ' Environmental Tobacco Smoke ', ' Regulation ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Intervention Community Trial ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Tobacco Control Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' women of childbearing age ', ' women of child bearing age ', ' Female of childbearing age ', ' Female of child bearing age ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' tobacco abstinence ', ' tobacco control ', ' community intervention ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community based participatory research ', ' provider intervention ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' biomarker ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2012,510019,0.14343660195320035
"Maximizing state & local policies to restrict tobacco marketing at point of sale    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The point of sale (POS) is where tobacco companies spend the vast majority of their marketing budget and have enjoyed the greatest freedom from regulation. Regulatory efforts by states and communities have included licensing and zoning laws to limit the number, location and concentration (density) of tobacco retailers, and minimum price laws to reduce the supply of discount tobacco products. State and local agencies are also increasingly focused on eliminating racial and socioeconomic disparities in the amount of marketing and the density of tobacco retailers. Signed into law in June, 2009, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA) will change dramatically the tobacco retail environment because it grants states and communities new power to regulate the time, place, and manner of POS tobacco marketing. The broad goal of the proposed research is to establish timely and crucial national surveillance of how the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and states implement new regulations, the impact on the retail environment, and the response of tobacco companies. The specific aims are to examine changes in tobacco marketing and pack prices in a representative sample of U.S. retailers, conduct implementation research that will guide states and communities seeking to more effectively regulate POS tobacco marketing, measure annual change in the density and composition of tobacco retailers in a representative sample of U.S. counties, and disseminate information on POS marketing and tobacco retailer density nationwide. This will be accomplished using state-of-the-art surveillance and ecological assessment methods to select a longitudinal sample of 2,000 retailers and conduct in-store audits of tobacco marketing and price at three time points. POS policies and their implementation will be accessed via a national survey of tobacco control program leaders in every state, conducted at the same three time points. Six case studies and four legal research projects regarding POS restrictions will also be conducted. The established surveillance mechanism and the dissemination of study results will serve as important resources for national, state, and local efforts to reduce the public health toll attributable to tobacco use.

"Faith Moves Mountains: A CBPR Appalachian Wellness & Cancer Prevention Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Appalachian communities are disproportionately affected by many of the leading risk factors associated with cancer incidence and mortality, factors amenable to primary and secondary prevention. Extensive involvement with our community partners has demonstrated strong community preference for a holistic approach toward cancer prevention; The proposed intervention extends our successful faith-based, trained lay health advisor tailored intervention, ""Faith Moves Mountains,"" (R01CA108696) initiated three years ago, to administer a culturally appropriate CBPR intervention. Working in partnership with 70 faith based institutions in rural Southeastern Kentucky, we propose to administer, evaluate, and disseminate a tailored wellness and cancer prevention program focused on four of the most common prevention activities that have the potential of greatly preventing and reducing cancer morbidity and mortality. These prevention activities include smoking cessation (targeting all chronic diseases, cervical and lung cancer); energy balance including dietary modification and physical activity promotion (targeting all chronic diseases and colorectal cancer (CRC)), and cancer screenings (targeting CRC, cervical, and breast cancer).      Consistent with our Faith Moves Mountains and cancer control approach, faith-based organizations will sponsor a ""kick off event"" or health fair in which participants will undergo a health risk appraisal (baseline). Participants will then select one or more wellness activities (smoking cessation, energy balance, cancer screening); then, trained lay health advisors will offer modules on each of these wellness activities. Smoking cessation will include the culturally relevant Cooper-Clayton method (outcome: smoking abstinence). For those targeting dietary modification and physical activity, a rural Appalachian modified Healthy Body/Healthy Spirit program will be administered (outcome: dietary change and physical activity participation). Tailored cancer screening promotion will be based on our current Faith Moves Mountains design (outcome: receipt of any recommended CRC screening test, Pap test for cervical cancer, and/or mammogram). To assess the intervention but remain consistent with community norms, we will employ a staggered intervention design. Throughout the project, the RE-AIM model will inform our evaluation. During phase three, this CBPR wellness approach to cancer prevention will undertake qualitative process evaluation interviews and disseminate the intervention to medically underserved Appalachian Ohio in collaboration with partners at Ohio State University. This collaboration will facilitate dissemination of successful intervention to additional rural Appalachian populations with high rates of cancer health disparities.

"Measurement of Tobacco Use among South Asians in the U.S.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite marked health disparities among South Asians internationally compared to the U.S. population, little is known about the health status of South Asians residing in the U.S. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research on tobacco use behaviors in South Asians. Moreover, tobacco consumption is characterized by a large proportion of indigenous tobacco products, such as bidis, which are small brown hand-rolled cigarettes, and gutkha and paan masala, types of chew tobacco. These popular South Asian tobacco products are also readily available in ethnic enclaves in the U.S. In addition, South Asians are the second largest Asian group in the U.S. and among the fastest growing immigrant groups. Existing studies of tobacco use in South Asians in the U.S. are limited as they tend to be geographically restricted or focused only on cigarette smoking. However, studies conducted in the U.K. suggest that immigrant South Asians may have high rates of tobacco use and may continue use of their native tobacco products. This exploratory research proposal describes a plan to explore measurement issues in tobacco use surveillance of South Asians in the U.S. Accordingly, we will: 1) conduct focus groups to understand tobacco use among South Asians in the U.S., 2) develop and refine a survey instrument, which will undergo cognitive testing, to assess the prevalence of products used by South Asians, 3) implement a population-based split sample randomized survey to compare standard tobacco use measures and new questions developed to measure South Asian-specific tobacco products, and 4) explore the feasibility of a respondent driven sampling (RDS) approach to reach South Asians. Thus, the significance of this proposed research is its potential to improve tobacco surveillance methodologies and generate a better understanding of indigenous tobacco use among South Asian immigrants which is vital to informing and directing tobacco control efforts.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this research project is to explore measurement issues in tobacco use surveillance of South Asians in the U.S. Thus, the significance of this proposed research is its potential to improve tobacco surveillance methodologies and generate a better understanding of indigenous tobacco use among South Asians which is vital to informing and directing tobacco control efforts.                  The purpose of this research project is to explore measurement issues in tobacco use surveillance of South Asians in the U.S. Thus, the significance of this proposed research is its potential to improve tobacco surveillance methodologies and generate a better understanding of indigenous tobacco use among South Asians which is vital to informing and directing tobacco control efforts.                ",Measurement of Tobacco Use among South Asians in the U.S.,8302800,R21CA164913,"['Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Health ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Hand ', ' Health behavior ', ' Feedback ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Cities ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Spit Tobacco ', ' Chewing Tobacco ', ' Oral Tobacco ', ' Communities ', ' Mainland China ', ' China ', ' Masks ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Methods ', ' Literature ', ' India ', ' Learning ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' National Health Services ', ' Research ', ' improved ', ' Measures ', ' Weight ', ' base ', ' Comprehension ', ' Tobacco ', ' seed ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Seeds ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Smoking, Tobacco and Cancer - Smokeless Tobacco ', ' Smokeless Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Testing ', ' Generations ', ' snuff tobacco ', ' snuff ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Immigrant ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' Techniques ', ' Respondent ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Measurement ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Reporting ', ' Categories ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Cigarette ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' experience ', ' interest ', ' Country ', ' Prevalence ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' tobacco control ', ' Cognitive ', ' Tobacco Surveillance ', ' South Asian ', ' Indigenous ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Data ', ' Address ', ' Subgroup ', ' bidis ', ' population based ', ' Population ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF MED/DENT NJ-SCH OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R21,2012,84001,0.0794043601188656
"Effectiveness of Proactive Tobacco Treatment in Diverse Low Income Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a high prevalence of smoking and high burden of tobacco related disease among low income populations. Effective, evidenced-based smoking cessation treatments are available, but low-income and minority smokers are less likely than higher-income and white smokers to use these treatments, especially the most comprehensive forms that include a combination of pharmacotherapy and intensive behavioral counseling. In this application, we test a novel proactive outreach strategy, coupled with free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to increase the population impact of tobacco cessation treatment for diverse, low income smokers. Population impact is the product of treatment utilization (i.e., reach or exposure) and treatment efficacy (i.e., smoking abstinence rates among those who utilize treatment); therefore, the theory- driven approach will systematically offer low income smokers free and easy access to evidence-based treatment for tobacco dependence outside the traditional health care system. The intervention has two primary components: 1) proactive outreach to current smokers in the form of mailed invitation materials and telephone calls containing targeted health messages, and 2) facilitated access to free, comprehensive, evidence-based treatment for tobacco dependence in the form of NRT and intensive, telephone-based behavioral counseling. Our specific aims are to: 1) compare the effect of proactive outreach combined with free NRT and telephone counseling (PRO+NRT+TC) to usual care (UC) on population-level smoking abstinence rates among a diverse population of low income smokers, 2) compare the effect of PRO+NRT+TC to usual care UC on population-level tobacco treatment utilization rates, and 3) determine the cost-effectiveness of PRO+NRT+TC. This proposal will examine the effects of the intervention in a population-based sample (N=2500) of adult smokers enrolled in the Minnesota Health Care Programs (MHCP), a state-funded health insurance plan for low income persons. Baseline data will be obtained from MHCP administrative databases and a participant survey that will be conducted prior to randomization. Outcome data will be collected from a follow-up survey conducted 12 months after randomization and MHCP administrative data. The primary outcome is prolonged smoking abstinence (6 months) and will be assessed at the population level. All randomized individuals will be asked to complete the follow-up survey, regardless of whether they participated in tobacco treatment. Data analysis of the primary aims will follow intent-to-treat methodology. The study team has unique, relevant experience with tobacco treatment studies in diverse, low income populations, proactive outreach and telephone counseling. We will work in partnership with the North American Quitline Consortium to disseminate study findings. If effective, proactive tobacco treatment would reduce tobacco- related morbidity, mortality and health care costs for low income Americans.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a high prevalence of smoking and high burden of tobacco related disease among low income populations. There is a critical need to increase access to effective tobacco dependence treatments.

"Motivating Smokers with Mobility Impairments to Quit Smoking  Abstract  People with physical disabilities experience similar health disparities as other disadvantaged groups (e.g., no insurance, decreased access to medical and preventive care, more co-morbidities) but significantly less attention is paid to their health promotion. While smoking cessation interventions have been developed for other disadvantaged groups, none exist for people with physical disabilities. People with physical disabilities (mobility impairments) who use assistance to ambulate have higher smoking rates (32.5%) than people who have a disability and do not need assistance (23%) and people who are not disabled (19.8%; Brawarsky et al. 2002). The aims of the current study are to: 1) develop a series of theory-based intervention DVDs focused on motivating smoking cessation among people with mobility impairments (i.e., chronically use some type of assistance to walk such as walker, cane, wheelchair, braces, etc) and 2) test the efficacy of the Intervention DVDs vs. Print-based Standard Care among 560 smokers with mobility impairments in a randomized trial. The materials in both groups will be mailed on a monthly basis for four months, and are organized in separate sections according to readiness to quit. Participants in both groups will receive a) nicotine patches at no cost if they are ready to quit and b) brief phone calls (~5 minutes) between mailings to assess and encourage viewing the materials. We hypothesize that smokers who are randomized to receive the Intervention DVDs will be significantly more likely to achieve 7-day and 30-day point-prevalence abstinence at 1, 6, and 12- month follow-ups vs. those who receive Print-based Standard Care. The Intervention DVDs will be based on Behavioral Activation Theory, and address specific barriers to quitting in this population (increased stress, decreased positive affect, increased depressed mood, activity restriction, and self-efficacy). We hypothesize that the intervention will impact these mediators directly, as well as indirectly through Behavioral Activation (goal setting and pleasant events). Our series of preliminary studies support the use of these mediators for people with mobility impairments and the use of DVDs as an acceptable mode of intervention, given the economic and mobility limitations of this population. If effective, our DVD intervention could have a high level of public health and clinical significance, as it could be easily disseminated at low cost through national disability-related organizations, networks of independent living centers, or physician offices, and substantially improve the health and quality of life for people with physical disabilities. This study is innovative because no studies have targeted this population, it applies Behavioral Activation Theory to smoking cessation, and it examines relatively novel mediators in the field of smoking (e.g., positive affect, behavioral activation).  Narrative No smoking cessation interventions exist that target smokers with mobility impairments, though 32.5% of this population smokes. The current study aims to develop theory-based Intervention DVD's for smoking cessation for people with mobility impairments and test its efficacy for increasing smoking cessation vs. print-based standard care in a randomized trial.",Motivating Smokers with Mobility Impairments to Quit Smoking,8324732,R01CA137616,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Braces ', ' Braces-Orthopedic appliances ', ' Walking Sticks ', ' Canes ', ' cane, includes canes of all materials, adjustable or fixed, with tip ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Independent Living ', ' Insurance ', ' literacy ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Mails ', ' Maintenance ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Motivation ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', "" Physicians' Offices "", ' Printing ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Target Populations ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Time ', ' Walkers ', ' mobile assistive system ', ' mobile assistive device ', ' mobile assistance system ', ' mobile assistance device ', ' Wheel Chairs ', ' Wheelchairs ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' disability ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Smoker ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' nicotine patch ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' self help ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' Abstinence ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' group intervention ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NCI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R01,2012,557023,0.23036027888124114
"Culturally Specific Interventions and Acculturation in African American Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The importance of reducing tobacco-associated health disparities between African Americans and Caucasians cannot be understated. Researchers suggest that interventions need to be targeted to specific racial/ethnic groups (i.e., cultural tailoring); however, the literature examining the efficacy of cultural tailoring is equivocal. The inconsistent findings may be related to methodological weaknesses of past research, such as confounding intervention intensity and contact, or failure to recognize the heterogeneity of African Americans. Moreover, no studies have considered individual-difference factors affecting responses to culturally specific interventions, such as level of acculturation and ethnic identity. The investigators' preliminary studies indicate that standard (i.e., not culturally specific) cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for smoking cessation can be successful among African Americans compared to health education. Therefore, the investigators propose to test the incremental efficacy of culturally specific CBT (CS-CBT), and to examine individual differences in intervention response. The specific aims are: (1) To test the efficacy of a group-based, CS-CBT in African American smokers; and (2) to examine level of acculturation and ethnic identity as ethno-cultural predictors of smoking abstinence (exploratory). The investigators hypothesize main effects of (1) intervention type, such that the CS-CBT will produce greater abstinence rates compared to standard CBT; and (2) time, such that the greater abstinence rates in the CS-CBT condition will be maintained over time. No interactions are expected. The investigators also hypothesize that the intervention effects will be moderated by African American cultural factors (e.g., beliefs, values, and practices). Specifically, they hypothesize that lower acculturation levels and greater ethnic identity (i.e., a more traditional cultural orientation) will yield greater smoking abstinence rates among participants in the culturally specific condition, compared to the standard condition. The opposite association is hypothesized in the standard condition. The investigators will use a 2 (intervention type) x 4 (time) randomized design. Factor 1: intervention type (CS-CBT or standard CBT); factor 2: time (baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months). The former treatment represents the experimental condition and the latter will be an established control condition. All participants will receive transdermal nicotine patch therapy. The primary abstinence outcome will be 7-day point-prevalence abstinence (ppa); secondary outcomes will be 24- hour and 7-day ppa, and 28-day continuous abstinence. The investigators will also examine process outcomes, including utilization, study retention, and intervention evaluations. Answering the questions of (a) whether CS interventions lead to greater smoking abstinence compared to their traditional counterparts, and (b) for whom CS approaches are most beneficial will inform theories related to 'cultural sensitivity' and best practices for tobacco intervention among African Americans.        African American smokers suffer disproportionately from smoking-associated diseases and deaths. This study will test a culturally specific cognitive-behavioral intervention for tobacco cessation by comparing it to standard cognitive-behavioral therapy. This study will also examine whether level of acculturation and ethnic identity predict who responds to either type of intervention. Thus, the investigators will address important, yet unanswered, questions with the goal of reducing health disparities.

"A comprehensive approach to secondary HIV prevention and care among positives     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronically ill, low income African Americans (AAs) have high rates of smoking and disparities in smoking related morbidity and mortality. Research is needed to inform more powerful, proactive tobacco control programs for low income AAs. Information is needed to understand effects of tobacco related communications on their tobacco use, and the extent to which HIV and drug use may affect their challenges to quitting. Research is also needed to identify communication channels for mitigating health impacts on their tobacco use. While new electronic media hold promise for promoting cessation, our formative study on clinic recruited, mostly low income, AA HIV+s, suggests their new media use is much lower than other populations'. Research indicates social networks can have powerful, enduring effects on smoking initiation and cessation, in part through interpersonal communication affecting close ties' behavior norms. Yet little attention has been given to identifying network and other social factors affecting tobacco use among low income AAs, or subgroups with chronic conditions. Nor has there been adequate attention to identifying viable community organizations as channels for smoking cessation messages for vulnerable AAs. The proposed mixed methods study will recruit currently smoking, former or current drug using, low income, AA, HIV+'s (n=250) from among those screened for the parent study, and a sample of HIV- network members (n=250). In Phase I we will conduct focus groups to explore the economic, social and cultural context of tobacco in the study population, and aspects particular to HIV and drug use. Just prior to Phase III (survey administration), we will conduct a computer administered experimental test (Phase III) of health warnings and tobacco claims on tobacco perceptions and behaviors. The study represents a logical scientific advancement for our multi-disciplinary research team, comprised of researchers from the Johns Hopkins Schools of Public Health and Medicine in community-based social network intervention and HIV clinical outcomes research among low income communities. The intervention builds on our team's successful social network-oriented prevention interventions and research on HIV adherence intervention. Our preliminary research indicates >80% of former or current drug using, low income AAs currently smoke and the vast majority expressed interest in quitting.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While chronically ill, low income African Americans have high smoking rates and adverse health effects of continued smoking, few smoking interventions have been tailored to them.

"Socioeconomic status and smoking exposure in Appalachia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Social inequalities are an important predictor of disease incidence, including cancer. Persons with low socioeconomic status (SES) have increased rates of lung and other tobacco-related cancers. Although smoking prevalence is higher in persons with lower levels of education and occupational status, smoking prevalence does not explain this excess risk. In prospective cohort studies, the associations between low SES and elevated lung cancer risk persist after adjustment for smoking amount and duration. The investigators' overall hypothesis is that the unaccounted increased risk in populations with lower SES is due to higher smoke exposure that cannot be accounted for by self-reported smoking habits. Their previous laboratory studies demonstrate that there is a wide degree of variation in biological exposure to tobacco smoke toxins and carcinogens per cigarette smoked. The investigators propose to conduct a community-based participatory study in the medically underserved area of Appalachian Pennsylvania to determine the relationship between SES and the dose of inhaled mainstream smoke and the dose of biological markers of tobacco smoke exposure. Specific aims are: Specific Aim 1. Determine whether SES is associated with smoking puffing behaviors including puff volume, duration, interval, and length of cigarette smoked. Specific Aim 2. Determine whether SES is associated with biomarkers of smoking exposure including salivary cotinine and expired carbon monoxide. This addresses the SES hypothesis using biological measures of dose in addition to environmental measures such as puffing dose. Specific Aim 3. Correlate environmental and biological measures of smoke exposure. This aim will determine whether levels of mainstream smoke exposure, as estimated by puffing profiles are determinants of the biological levels of cigarette smoke exposure, and whether this relationship differs by SES. This brings together aims 1 and 2 to comprehensively address the SES hypothesis. Specific Aim 4. Determine the effects of psychological stress, as assessed by psychological scales and salivary stress biomarkers, on smoking puffing parameters and salivary cotinine levels. The proposed research study will be conducted in Appalachia, Pennsylvania (PA), a NIH-designated medically underserved but socioeconomically diverse population. The investigators predict that lower SES is associated with higher smoke intake as determined by topography and smoke biomarkers, and that this finding will help to explain the long-observed patterns of lung cancer incidence disparities.        A major objective of cancer control efforts is to understand the causes of social inequalities in cancer rates. Cigarette smokers of lower socioeconomic status (SES) have increased rates of lung cancer and other tobacco-related diseases than smokers of higher SES. Because smoking is a modifiable behavior, findings that demonstrate more intensive smoking and greater exposure to tobacco smoke among low SES smokers may be helpful in developing more effective and targeted smoking control efforts.

"A trial of Positively Smoke Free group therapy for HIV-infected smokers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are 1.1 million persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the US, 60% of them smoke cigarettes, and 75% of these are interested in quitting. Almost none are currently accessing smoking cessation interventions designed to meet their specific needs and concerns.  Cigarette smoking is responsible for 24% of deaths among PLWH, and 30% of non-AIDS defining malignancies. It is driving the alarming rise in cardiac events and lung cancers in this highly vulnerable population. The lack of access to proven, effective, culturally appropriate tobacco cessation services represents a health disparity of the first order. The psychosocial profile of the PLWH-smoker community, characterized by high rates of psychiatric comorbidity, drug and alcohol use, and low levels of social support, suggests that achieving high cessation rates will be a great challenge.  Positively Smoke Free (PSF) is an intensive, multisession, group cessation program specifically developed for PLWH smokers. A pilot study of PSF yielded promising results. This proposal aims (1) to perform a definitive efficacy study of PSF by comparing 6-month biochemically confirmed abstinence rates in subjects randomized to PSF vs. standard care in a cohort of 450 PLWH smokers, (2) to determine the sociobehavioral moderators and mediators associated with successful cessation, and (3) to complete a careful cost analysis of PSF in order to estimate the incremental cost per quit associated program participation.  If PSF is proven to be effective it will establish a new treatment option for PLWH smokers. Determination of moderators and mediators of program success will provide insight into the mode of action of the intervention and will help guide the development of additional treatment strategies in the future. Finally, the cost analyses will provide critical information abut the feasibility of program dissemination and implementation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic of cigarette smoking is fueling an alarming rise in lung and other cancers in persons living with HIV (PLWH). Smokers living with HIV have few, if any, cessation resources available to them that address their particular needs, and HIV care providers have virtually no evidence base to guide their approach to tobacco treatment. The proposal, if funded, will conduct a definitive study of a group therapy intervention for PLWH smokers that showed promise in a pilot trial.                    ",A trial of Positively Smoke Free group therapy for HIV-infected smokers,8602908,R01DA036445,"['etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Learning ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Moods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Societies ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Therapeutic Community ', ' Therapeutic community technique ', ' Tobacco ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' Urban Population ', ' Work ', ' Administrator ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' Opportunistic Infection AIDS ', ' HIV-Related Opportunistic Infections ', ' AIDS Associated Opportunistic Infection ', ' AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Smoker ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' peer ', ' Modality ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Reporting ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' HAART ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' trend ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Group Therapy ', ' working group ', ' post intervention ', ' pilot trial ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Abstinence ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment strategy ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NIDA,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2013,774031,0.19462059537401286
"Behavioral and Environmental Contributors to Tobacco Disparities in Rural Youth     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use in rural populations is a pressing public health issue. Individuals living in rural areas suffer disproportionately from tobacco use, with cross-sectional surveys consistently showing higher prevalence rates of cigarette smoking and smokeless tobacco use in rural areas compared to metropolitan areas. While the scientific knowledge about adolescent tobacco use has grown significantly in the past several decades, most of this knowledge is based primarily on youth living in urban areas. The proposed work utilizes over a decade of existing longitudinal data from Minnesota to characterize important factors that may contribute to tobacco-related disparities in rural communities. The aims of the current proposal are to: (1) examine differences in the progression of cigarette smoking and smokeless tobacco use among rural and metropolitan youth during adolescence and young adulthood and (2) assess how the social and tobacco control environments differ in rural and metropolitan areas, and how these account for differences in rates and patterns of smoking among rural and metropolitan youth. Youth in rural areas are hypothesized to show higher rates of initiation and at earlier ages, heavier use patterns, fewer quit attempts, and lower rates of cessation compared to metropolitan youth. Rural youth are further hypothesized to report higher levels of smoking among their social networks, greater social acceptability of smoking, greater access to tobacco, and exposure to fewer tobacco control policies than youth in metropolitan areas and that these factors will relate to heavier patterns of use among rural youth. We will also examine if factors associated with differences in rates of tobacco use among rural and metropolitan youth are comparable in a large diverse sample of youth from Florida. We hypothesize that the factors associated with differences in rates of smoking among rural and metropolitan youth in Minnesota will be comparable in Florida. The proposed approach is innovative because it includes a repeated measures design with a large sample of youth from rural and metropolitan areas, along with detailed and frequent data about tobacco use behaviors from adolescence to young adulthood, as well as links between behavior and a multitude of social factors that may affect tobacco use and cessation among rural youth. The proposed project is expected to advance our understanding of tobacco-related disparities among rural youth by providing a detailed understanding of factors associated with tobacco disparities in rural youth that have been observed in cross-sectional studies. Importantly, the proposed project will provide an evidence base for designing effective interventions aimed at reducing tobacco use in rural populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will characterize important differences in smoking between rural and metropolitan youth that contribute to tobacco-related disparities in rural communities. The results are expected to aid in the development of effective interventions for reducing tobacco use, and ultimately tobacco-related morbidity and mortality, in rural communities. The proposed research is relevant to NCI's mission to reduce health disparities in cancer.            ",Behavioral and Environmental Contributors to Tobacco Disparities in Rural Youth,8430275,R03CA168411,"['Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' artificial environment ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' Florida ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Learning ', ' Minnesota ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Rural Population ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Controls ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Smoking, Tobacco and Cancer - Smokeless Tobacco ', ' Smokeless Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Rural Community ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' urban area ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Rural ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' middle school ', ' high school ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Cigarette ', ' Prevention program ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' tobacco control ', ' tobacco use prevention ', ' prevent tobacco use ', ' tobacco prevention ', ' tobacco exposure ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' ']",NCI,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2013,81067,0.10507054930077753
"Reducing socioeconomic disparities in tobacco dependence treatment outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tobacco use is a leading contributor to racial and socioeconomic health disparities in the US primarily due to an unequal burden of tobacco-related disease from a disproportionate share of smokers in lower socioeconomic (SES) groups in which minorities, particularly African Americans, are disproportionately represented.1-5 Although deemed effective for all smokers,6 the standard cognitive-behavioral treatment for tobacco dependence is significantly less effective for lower SES smokers.7-15 Tobacco dependence treatment, however, has the potential to reduce racial and socioeconomic disparities in achieving long-term abstinence by proactively providing our most at-risk smokers with the specific treatment components they need to achieve abstinence through the existing extensive treatment delivery system.16, 17 Our preliminary studies indicate that in addition to several socio-cultural barriers to engaging in treatment,18 there are several key factors associated with socioeconomic disparities in relapse rates and thus treatment outcomes. These factors include: stress, negative affect, smoking in response to negative affect, delay discounting, locus of control, impulsiveness, exposure to smokers in the environment, and treatment utilization (see Table 1).19, 20 Based on this and other evidence, our overall goal is to revise the standard treatment with specific, evidence-based, cognitive-behavioral strategies to address these key factors as well as target and tailor the approach to more fully meet the needs of lower SES and minority smokers, thereby reducing treatment outcome disparities. We expect: 1) The revised treatment (RT) to reduce socioeconomic disparities in treatment outcomes, and 2) Participants treated with the RT to demonstrate more improvement on each of the key factors associated with disparities than those treated with standard treatment (ST). The specific aims include: 1) Complete a revised draft of a widely utilized standard treatment manual that addresses each of the key factors with treatment components. This aim is partially accomplished (see Appendix for preliminary draft). 2) Using the PEN-3 Model,21-23 target and tailor the daft RT to more fully represent the experiences of smokers who are of lower SES and /or of minority status, particularly African American smokers. 3) Pilot test the targeted/tailored draft RT with three treatment groups (n=5-10 per group) to assess understandability and acceptability and to ensure that it can be delivered in the same timeframe as the ST. 4) Compare the effects of SES on treatment outcomes with socioeconomically and racially diverse participants treated with ST (n=110) and RT (n=110) in a randomized treatment design. 5) Compare the effects of treatment condition on each of the key factors. This innovative approach refines, improves upon, and applies theoretically derived and empirically supported concepts and strategies. If effective at reducing treatment outcome disparities, the manual-driven RT will be easily disseminable as a ""new"" standard, having a sustained and powerful impact on the field and contributing to a reduction in the magnitude of the present tobacco-related racial and socioeconomic health disparities.           Tobacco use is a leading contributor to racial and socioeconomic health disparities in the US primarily due to an unequal burden of tobacco-related disease from a disproportionate share of smokers in African American and lower socioeconomic (SES) groups. Unlike many other health risk behaviors, tobacco-related health disparities are increasing despite a large treatment network of free telephone and in-person counseling services, perhaps due to significant disparities in treatment outcomes. The goal of this project is to revise the standard treatment for tobacco dependence to address key factors associated with treatment outcome disparities and more fully meet the needs of lower SES and African American smokers thereby reducing socioeconomic disparities in tobacco dependence treatment outcomes, halting the alarming increase in tobacco-related health disparities, and reducing a leading cause of racial and socioeconomic health disparities in the US.

"Maximizing state & local policies to restrict tobacco marketing at point of sale    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The point of sale (POS) is where tobacco companies spend the vast majority of their marketing budget and have enjoyed the greatest freedom from regulation. Regulatory efforts by states and communities have included licensing and zoning laws to limit the number, location and concentration (density) of tobacco retailers, and minimum price laws to reduce the supply of discount tobacco products. State and local agencies are also increasingly focused on eliminating racial and socioeconomic disparities in the amount of marketing and the density of tobacco retailers. Signed into law in June, 2009, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA) will change dramatically the tobacco retail environment because it grants states and communities new power to regulate the time, place, and manner of POS tobacco marketing. The broad goal of the proposed research is to establish timely and crucial national surveillance of how the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and states implement new regulations, the impact on the retail environment, and the response of tobacco companies. The specific aims are to examine changes in tobacco marketing and pack prices in a representative sample of U.S. retailers, conduct implementation research that will guide states and communities seeking to more effectively regulate POS tobacco marketing, measure annual change in the density and composition of tobacco retailers in a representative sample of U.S. counties, and disseminate information on POS marketing and tobacco retailer density nationwide. This will be accomplished using state-of-the-art surveillance and ecological assessment methods to select a longitudinal sample of 2,000 retailers and conduct in-store audits of tobacco marketing and price at three time points. POS policies and their implementation will be accessed via a national survey of tobacco control program leaders in every state, conducted at the same three time points. Six case studies and four legal research projects regarding POS restrictions will also be conducted. The established surveillance mechanism and the dissemination of study results will serve as important resources for national, state, and local efforts to reduce the public health toll attributable to tobacco use.

"Yale SCOR on Gender-Sensitive Treatment for Tobacco Dependence     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Yale-SCOR is bringing together leading basic and clinical science experts to establish an interdisciplinary, translational, cross-species program of research aimed at identifying novel therapeutics to address the critical health disparity that female smokers face. Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States. Women, compared to men, have poorer rates of smoking cessation, exacerbated health risks, and FDA-approved medications for smoking cessation may not be as effective for women or have emerging limits due to side effects. However, few attempts have been made to develop gender-sensitive smoking cessation treatments. The considerable body of data suggesting that women are more likely to smoke to regulate negative affect and stress while men are more likely to smoke for the reinforcing properties of nicotine suggests an important direction in the development of a new approach to smoking cessation treatments. Using both preclinical and clinical strategies, our interdisciplinary team will probe te noradrenergic system's effects on stress-reactivity and nicotine reinforcement -hypothesizing that (a) different brain systems modulated by noradrenergic activity are activated by smoking in women and men, and (b) guanfacine (an alpha-2a noradrenergic agonist) can preferentially target these gender-sensitive systems to improve smoking cessation outcomes. Using a translational approach with an interdisciplinary team effort, we are proposing three projects that will have inter-related and shared goals, with each providing unique contributions to the development of gender-sensitive therapeutics. This new application will catalyze Yale's significant resources to support interdisciplinary and translational science in women's health to pursue extremely timely scientific findings that could represent a breakthrough in our understanding of treatments for a public health problem that affects millions daily. Our specific aims and objectives of the Yale-SCOR are to:    AIM 1: Evaluate the role of the noradrenergic system and its interactions with cholinergic and dopaminergic systems, in stress-induced smoking relapse and nicotine-based reinforcement, and use these findings to inform and expedite the development of gender-sensitive therapeutics for smoking cessation.    AIM 2: Mentor junior investigators in conducting interdisciplinary translational research on tobacco use and women's health through training opportunities, including ""clerkships"" with SCOR PIs, and pilot funding.    AIM 3: Be a national resource to invigorate and galvanize the study of sex and gender differences in relation to smoking by providing expert consultation; supporting faculty training awards; mining national data on gender, smoking and health outcomes to inform health policy; and expanding our current program of local and national community outreach.          Women compared to men, have poorer rates of smoking cessation and exacerbated health risks yet few attempts have been made to develop gender-sensitive smoking cessation treatments. This research will contribute to the public health by providing a neurobiologically-informed approach to the development of gender-sensitive therapeutics for smoking cessation, mentoring the next generation of interdisciplinary and translational researchers, and providing a national resource for women's health and tobacco use.            ",Yale SCOR on Gender-Sensitive Treatment for Tobacco Dependence,8501386,P50DA033945,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' California ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cities ', ' Consultations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Dyes ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Faculty ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' London ', ' Los Angeles ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Names ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Registries ', ' Reinforcement (Psychology) ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Benzeneacetamide, N-(aminoiminomethyl)-2,6-dichloro- ', ' Guanfacine ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' Agonist ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Smoker ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Consult ', ' Services ', ' Church ', ' cholinergic ', ' noradrenergic ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' human ESC ', ' human ES cell ', ' hESC ', ' human embryonic stem cell ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Province ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Last Name ', ' Smoking and Health ', ' Smoking and Health Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Instruction ', ' performance site ', ' next generation ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' translational approach ', ' FDA approved ', ' smoking relapse ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,P50,2013,1477040,0.2871159896441585
"Smoking Cessation Interventions and Program Availability for Drug and Alcohol Add    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of smoking among individuals seeking treatment for a co-occurring substance abuse condition is very high, between 70%-95% (Burling & Ziff, 1988; Fiore et al., 2000; Kozlowski et al., 1986; McCarthy et al., 2002). However, many drug treatment facilities do not encourage smoking cessation during treatment, even though patients are often show interest in quitting smoking. Research finds that not only are low income people more likely to smoke, but the resources for smoking cessation may not be as accessible as those who have higher income (Novotny & Giovino, 1998; MMRW, November 9, 2007; Barbeau et al., 2004; Honjo et al., 2006). Therefore, substance abuse treatment is a context where evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for smoking might have the best chance of reaching low-income smokers. Treating patient smoking concurrent with other drugs is important since research demonstrates that addiction to nicotine may cause changes in brain chemistry and structure which could trigger drug and alcohol cravings, decreasing the chance of prolonged sobriety (Britt & McGehee, 2008; Yeh et al., 2007). The proposed project pursues two objectives related to understanding the adoption, implementation, and sustainability (or conversely discontinuation) of EBTs for smoking in substance abuse treatment contexts. The first aim examines longitudinally the availability of EBTs for smoking among those seeking treatment for co-occurring substance abuse and explores the predictors of changes in service availability over time in treatment programs. Key categories of predictors include the percentage of low-income clients served by the treatment center, organizational and policy factors, and workforce characteristics. The second aim also uses a longitudinal design to examine the evidence-based clinical practice behaviors that counselors engage in with clients. This is important because individuals implement EBTs not organizations or treatment programs (Fixsen et al., 1995). Integrating theory and research from implementation science, public health, organizational change, substance abuse treatment, and health services delivery four categories of moderator variables are examined to understand why and under what conditions counselors are likely to engage clients in smoking cessation efforts with clients.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health-related risks of smoking make it a major public health concern, particularly in light of recent research suggesting that the addictive properties of nicotine are similar to that of opiates. There are also health disparities in both smoking behavior and smoking treatment as a function of socio-economic status and race/ethnicity. Many low-income people also lack access to high quality medical care (Warnecke et al., 2008) and are over-represented in substance abuse treatment contexts. By focusing on the availability, implementation, and sustainability of evidence-based treatments for smoking in the context of substance abuse treatment the proposed application has clear public health (including public health policy) relevance.

"DISC:  Describe Smoking Cessation in RCT Multi-Component Behavioral Intervention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Behavioral interventions are commonly used to promote smoking cessation. They typically have multiple components and are implemented over time. Smokers' engagement and response behaviors change over the course of interventions, resulting in substantial individual variations in outcomes. However, methods are underdeveloped for characterizing smokers' complex behaviors in longitudinal multi-component interventions. Internet-based and face-to-face culturally-tailored interventions are two promising, but relatively unexplored, behavioral interventions. The first is cost effective for reaching generl smoking populations, yet we know little about how to adequately measure individuals' dynamic online engagement with an intervention or examine its efficacy. The second targets specific populations, but we need to learn how racial/ethnic groups respond to such interventions and how much cultural tailoring is useful. We propose a new pattern-recognition approach to characterize complex engagement/response behaviors during Internet-based and culturally tailored interventions. Our approach is built on the PI's preliminary smoking behavior studies, for which she developed a multiple-imputation-based fuzzy clustering model (MI-Fuzzy) to identify pregnancy smoking behavioral patterns, and to cope with real-world situations where smokers have memberships in multiple clusters and their smoking data are longitudinal, non-normal, high dimensional and contain many missing values. Herein, we will enhance MI-Fuzzy with new features, compare it to typical models, and expand our pattern approach to two longitudinal behavioral intervention studies: (1) Dr. Houston's large-scale NCI-funded, Quit-Primo Internet intervention for a general smoking population, and (2) Dr. Kim's small-scale NIDA-funded cognitive, culturally tailored, clinic-based TDTA intervention for a minority smoking population. We will characterize smokers' online engagement (Quit-Primo) and cognitive responses (TDTA), evaluate how the interventions' components work for different smokers, clarify their efficacy, and provide a new, detailed understanding of how smokers' trajectory patterns relate to different cessation outcomes. Better understanding of how smokers engage with and respond to interventions will help uncover important relationships missed by traditional approaches, yield new evidence on how to improve these interventions for targeted populations and on high-risk behavioral patterns that may be clinically important for early intervention. Examining different types of behavioral interventions will also facilitate generalizing our pattern approach to other substance-use studies and populations. By providing analytical prototypes and accessible tools, this study will advance general pattern recognition methodology, and accelerate its utility in behavioral studies of substance use. As our dissemination activities expand, this work will likely stimulate similar studies for better and targeted interventions, ultimately benefiting patient-centered care related to substance use.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Behavioral interventions are commonly used to help people quit smoking, among which Internet-based and culturally tailored interventions are promising but relatively unexplored formats. Even when interventions are delivered uniformly, smokers engage with and respond to them differently. Our innovative pattern-recognition approach, MI-Fuzzy, will help characterize smokers' complex engagement and response behaviors during interventions, evaluate how intervention components work for different types of smokers, clarify the efficacy of each intervention, and provide a new, detailed understanding of how smokers' distinct behavioral patterns are associated with cessation outcomes. Better insight on smokers' engagement and responses during interventions will help improve these interventions for targeted populations and learn about high-risk behavioral patterns that may be clinically important for early intervention. By testing MI-Fuzzy in two funded studies (one Internet-based and one culturally tailored) and providing accessible software tools, our study will accelerate behavioral research on substance use, thereby benefiting large numbers of patients with substance use issues.            ",DISC:  Describe Smoking Cessation in RCT Multi-Component Behavioral Intervention,8505922,R01DA033323,"['Asian Americans ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Smoking ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Funding ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Simulate ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' behavior change ', ' Korean American ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' Population Study ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Cognitive ', ' Observational Study ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Characteristics ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' microsystems ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' demographics ', ' implementation science ', ' smoking intervention ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2013,237263,0.1661892452701728
"Financial Incentives for Smoking Cessation Among Disadvantaged Pregnant Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking during pregnancy is the leading preventable cause of poor pregnancy outcomes in the U.S.  Most pregnant smokers continue smoking through pregnancy producing serious immediate and longer-term adverse health consequences for the infant.    Smoking during pregnancy is highly associated  with  economic  disadvantage and a substantive contributor to health disparities.     Efficacious  interventions  are  available  but  cessation  rates  are  low  (<20 percent)  and  improvements  in  birth  outcomes often modest or absent.  Current treatments usually entail relatively brief, low-cost interventions (e.g. pregnancy-specific quit lines).  There is broad consensus that more effective interventions are sorely needed.    We  have  developed  a  novel  behavioral-economic  intervention  in  which  women  earn  financial  incentives contingent on smoking abstinence.  In a meta-analysis of treatments for smoking during pregnancy, effect sizes achieved with financial incentives were several-fold larger than those achieved with lower-intensity approaches or medications.    The  intervention  also  appears  to  improve  birth  outcomes  and  increase  breastfeeding duration.  While highly promising, further research is needed in at least three areas.  (1) The evidence on birth outcomes and breastfeeding is from studies that combined data across trials rather than a single prospective trial, (2) whether the intervention produces other postpartum improvements in health has not been investigated, and (3) the overall cost-effectiveness of this approach has not been examined.    To  examine  these  unanswered  questions,  we  are  proposing  a  randomized,  controlled  clinical  trial  comparing  the  efficacy  and  cost  effectiveness  throuh  one-year  postpartum  of  current  best  practices  for  smoking-cessation  during  pregnancy  vs.  best  practices  plus  financial  incentives  among  230  pregnant,  Medicaid  recipients.   We  will  also  include  a  third  condition  of  115  pregnant  non-smokers  matched  to  the  smokers on socio-demographic and health conditions to compare the extent to which the treatments reduce  the burden of smoking and to estimate how much more might be accomplished by further improvements in this  incentives intervention without exceeding cost-effectiveness.  We hypothesize that best practices plus financial  incentives will be more effective than best practices alone, that the incentives intervention will be cost effective,  and  that  while  adding the  incentives  reduces  a  greater  proportion  of  the  health  and  economic  burden  of  smoking than best practices alone, more can be done while remaining cost effective.     Overall, the proposed study has the potential to substantially advance knowledge on cost-effective smoking cessation for pregnant women.    Importantly,  because  of  the  strong  association  between  smoking  during  pregnancy  and  economic  disadvantage,  the  proposed  study  also  has  the  potential  to  contribute  new  knowledge relevant to reducing the serious challenges of health disparities.              PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We  will  examine  whether  adding  financial  incentives  to  current  best  practices  for  smoking  cessation  during  pregnancy  (i.e.,  counseling  using  a  telephone  quit-line)  increases cessation rates and improves infant health.  While more expensive upfront,  this  treatment  approach  may  be  economically  justified  by  the  later  cost  savings  associated  with  more  women  quitting,  having  healthier  babies,  and  needing  less  healthcare.  It should also help to reduce the greater risk for health problems often seen among those who less well off economically.                 ",Financial Incentives for Smoking Cessation Among Disadvantaged Pregnant Women,8468274,R01HD075669,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Breastfeeding ', ' Breast Feeding ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Femur ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Gestational Age ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Hospital Records ', ' inducement ', ' Incentives ', ' Infant ', ' low birthweight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birth weight ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' Medicaid ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy Complications ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Prenatal care ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Illness Behavior ', ' Sick Role ', ' Smoking ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Woman ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Cost Savings ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Postpartum ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Infant Health ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Policies ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Nation ', ' Developed Country ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Smoker ', ' nonsmoker ', ' Non-smoker ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' Visit ', ' infantile death ', ' infant demise ', ' death in first year of life ', ' infant death ', ' meetings ', ' novel ', ' Controlled Study ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' Reporting ', ' intrauterine growth ', ' Fetal Growth ', ' Fetal Body Weight ', ' Fetal Weight ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Smoking Status ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' tobacco use in pregnancy ', ' prenatally tobacco exposed ', ' prenatal tobacco exposure ', ' prenatal nicotine exposure ', ' prenatal cigarette smoking ', ' pregnant smoker ', ' pregnant cigarette smoker ', ' nicotine use in pregnancy ', ' Prenatal Tobacco Smoke ', ' Gestational cigarette smoke exposure ', ' Fetal Smoke Exposure ', ' fetal tobacco exposure ', ' Behavioral ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Abstinence ', ' infant outcome ', ' trial comparing ', ' non-smoking ', ' high risk ', ' pregnant ', ' public health relevance ', ' control trial ', ' effective intervention ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' financial incentive ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2013,740273,0.1482375636714988
"Enhancing cancer outreach for low-income adults with innovative smoking cessation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence indicates that the prevalence of current cigarette smoking among adults in the US has dropped below 20%. While this drop is encouraging, smoking still represents the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the US. Moreover, smoking prevalence is significantly higher among certain population groups, such as those with low levels of education and those living at, or below the poverty level. Therefore, efforts to target these underserved populations with efficacious smoking cessation treatments represents a vital public health effort. The overarching goal of this group-randomized trial is to design and evaluate a novel smoking cessation program targeted to uninsured and underinsured individuals. Key elements of the proposed study will be the use of an established network of community sites (e.g., community centers and churches) and a mobile unit, enabling us to reach individuals confronted with significant barriers to utilizing more traditional smoking cessation treatment approaches.       Specific aims of the study will be to: 1) Compare the efficacy of three smoking cessation interventions targeting community based low income uninsured and underinsured individuals in a group-randomized trial. The interventions will include a Standard Care (SC) approach, consisting of brief advice to quit smoking, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and self-help written materials; an Enhanced Care (EC) approach, consisting of the standard care components plus a single health feedback and motivational interviewing counseling session and a cell phone-delivered text/graphical messaging component; and an Intensive Care (IC) approach, consisting of all SC and EC components plus a series of 11 cell phone-delivered proactive counseling sessions and a cell phone-delivered text/graphical messaging component; 2) Evaluate the role of quit motivation, nicotine withdrawal, risk perception, self- efficacy, social support, and negative affect as potential mediators of smoking abstinence; and 3) Compare the cost-effectiveness of the three treatment conditions.       We believe that of the three conditions, the IC will most successfully address the needs of low-income smokers for several reasons. First, the IC program will be personalized, individualized, and equipped with an intensive, extended counseling and support module provided over the cell phone. Second, the program will combine three intervention components featuring high potential for maintaining support and motivation to quit and prevent relapse. Third, the IC intervention makes use of cell phone technology - an approach that has demonstrated feasibility and efficacy among low-income smokers in previous research conducted by the investigative team. The proposed study offers a number of features (proximity of services to the place of residence, provision of cell phones, etc.) that are likely to reduce treatment barriers while enhancing participant recruitment and retention.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will use an existing network of community sites and a mobile unit to deliver smoking cessation treatment to a multiethnic population of uninsured and underinsured adults living in the greater Houston, Texas metropolitan area. The treatments will include components such as brief advice to quit, nicotine patch, written materials, motivational interviewing/health feedback counseling, text/pix messaging, and proactive cell phone counseling.

"Contingency Management for Smoking Cessation in Pregnant Minority Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to reduce tobacco-related disparities in maternal and infant health outcomes by improving smoking cessation and relapse prevention interventions for minority pregnant and postpartum women, who have been significantly underrepresented in smoking cessation research. This study will examine the feasibility and efficacy of a prize-based contingency management approach for increasing smoking cessation and preventing relapse among socioeconomically disadvantaged minority pregnant smokers. First, the intervention will be pretested with 10 pregnant low-income minority smokers and then refined based on acceptability survey and focus group data. Next, a pilot study will be conducted. 60 highly disadvantaged minority women, recruited from the outpatient obstetric clinics at a large teaching hospital, who report daily smoking and who meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., 18 years or older; < 28 weeks gestational age) will be enrolled ad randomized to one of two study conditions: 1) Standard Psychoeducational Intervention (6- week, individually-administered, pregnancy-specific Quit Smoking Now curriculum, as currently implemented in the clinic; QSN-SP); 2) Standard Psychoeducational Intervention plus Contingency Management (provision of incentives contingent on biochemically-verified abstinence; QSN-CM). Abstinence monitoring via expired carbon monoxide and salivary continues levels will occur in both groups beginning on the first quit day and continuing through 3-months postpartum. Only participants in the QSN-CM group will be reinforced for biochemically-verified abstinence with chances to win prizes ranging in value from approximately $1 to $100 ('fishbowl' or 'prize bowl' method). Primary study outcomes include: intervention attendance and completion; and continuous, prolonged and point prevalence tobacco abstinence (self-report with biochemical verification). Secondary outcomes include: maternal and infant health outcomes (e.g., gestational age; infant birth weight, length and head circumference; delivery/neonatal complications; infant growth and respiratory health). The study will also examine factors (e.g., depression, stress) influencing treatment response. Outcomes will be assessed through follow-up research exams (delivery and 6-months postpartum) and hospital chart reviews. Results should advance scientific knowledge regarding effective methods for promoting and maintaining smoking abstinence among pregnant disadvantaged women and provide preliminary feasibility and efficacy data needed to support a larger randomized controlled trial.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prenatal smoking has been associated with numerous adverse pregnancy and delivery complications. Socioeconomically disadvantaged, minority women are less likely to quit smoking, are more likely to relapse after cessation and may suffer greater health consequences, for themselves and their baby, as a result of smoking. The proposed project seeks to reduce disparities in tobacco-related maternal and infant health outcomes by improving smoking cessation and relapse prevention interventions for low-income, minority

"Measurement of Tobacco Use among South Asians in the U.S.     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite marked health disparities among South Asians internationally compared to the U.S. population, little is known about the health status of South Asians residing in the U.S. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research on tobacco use behaviors in South Asians. Moreover, tobacco consumption is characterized by a large proportion of indigenous tobacco products, such as bidis, which are small brown hand-rolled cigarettes, and gutkha and paan masala, types of chew tobacco. These popular South Asian tobacco products are also readily available in ethnic enclaves in the U.S. In addition, South Asians are the second largest Asian group in the U.S. and among the fastest growing immigrant groups. Existing studies of tobacco use in South Asians in the U.S. are limited as they tend to be geographically restricted or focused only on cigarette smoking. However, studies conducted in the U.K. suggest that immigrant South Asians may have high rates of tobacco use and may continue use of their native tobacco products. This exploratory research proposal describes a plan to explore measurement issues in tobacco use surveillance of South Asians in the U.S. Accordingly, we will: 1) conduct focus groups to understand tobacco use among South Asians in the U.S., 2) develop and refine a survey instrument, which will undergo cognitive testing, to assess the prevalence of products used by South Asians, 3) implement a population-based split sample randomized survey to compare standard tobacco use measures and new questions developed to measure South Asian-specific tobacco products, and 4) explore the feasibility of a respondent driven sampling (RDS) approach to reach South Asians. Thus, the significance of this proposed research is its potential to improve tobacco surveillance methodologies and generate a better understanding of indigenous tobacco use among South Asian immigrants which is vital to informing and directing tobacco control efforts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this research project is to explore measurement issues in tobacco use surveillance of South Asians in the U.S. Thus, the significance of this proposed research is its potential to improve tobacco surveillance methodologies and generate a better understanding of indigenous tobacco use among South Asians which is vital to informing and directing tobacco control efforts.                ",Measurement of Tobacco Use among South Asians in the U.S.,8543665,R21CA164913,"['Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Spit Tobacco ', ' Chewing Tobacco ', ' Oral Tobacco ', ' Mainland China ', ' China ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cities ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' India ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Masks ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' National Health Services ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' seed ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Seeds ', ' snuff tobacco ', ' snuff ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Smoking, Tobacco and Cancer - Smokeless Tobacco ', ' Smokeless Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Weight ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Measurement ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' interest ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' Cigarette ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Categories ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Indigenous ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' South Asian ', ' Tobacco Surveillance ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' tobacco control ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' bidis ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' ']",NCI,RBHS-SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R21,2013,242910,0.07620900205974798
"Web-based Smoking Cessation Program for Tribal College Students     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  American Indian tribal college students have the highest smoking rates of any racial/ethnic group in the young adult population and also are disproportionately burdened by smoking-related morbidity and mortality. There are very few effective culturally-tailored smoking cessation programs for AI smokers. Our research group has worked with the American Indian community for the past 8 years to develop a culturally-tailored smoking cessation program (All Nations Breath of Life - ANBL), for AI adult smokers. All Nations Breath of Life was developed using the community-based participatory research approach and is an in-person group based program that incorporates cultural issues throughout the program. We have produced 30% cessation rates at 6-month follow-up with adult American Indian smokers from tribes and nations in the Midwest. Due to limited studies with the tribal college population, we have already conducted a cross-sectional internet-based survey to collect information on their smoking behaviors as well as other health behaviors. This research experience and strong collaboration with the AI community leaves us well poised to adapt the ANBL program for the tribal college smoking population. However, this current program needs substantial modifications to meet the unique needs of the tribal college student population. It recognizes the sacred role of tobacco among many American Indians and how culture affects smoking cessation among AIs, while still addressing recreational smoking. However, preliminary data from our recent studies indicate that the internet may be more favorable and appropriate delivery method for reaching this younger and more mobile tribal college population due to the web interactivity, immediacy of feedback, and wide reach and accessibility. This current proposal reflects a natural progression to addressing the significant problem of smoking among tribal college students using our successful methods. In this study, we will adapt and test a culturally tailored internet-based smoking cessation (I-ANBL) program based on ANBL, which was developed through CBPR methods. For the current proposal, we will conduct an individual randomized controlled trial (N=242) to test the effectiveness of an internet-based culturally-tailored smoking cessation program (I-ANBL) in a tribal college student population. Data will be collected at baseline, 3 months and 6 months using salivary cotinine, as well as comprehensive set of environmental and psychosocial measures. We hypothesize that AI tribal college students randomized to the culturally-tailored smoking cessation internet arm (I-ANBL) will have significantly higher continuous abstinence rates at 6 months than those receiving the heart healthy diet intervention (I-FV), focusing on increasing fruit and vegetable consumption. We will also examine the costs of delivering the tailored intervention program and potential mediators and moderators of the intervention-cessation relationship. Such a high-reach, low-cost strategy for promoting smoking cessation in this at-risk and underserved population could have great potential for adoption on a larger scale and thus help reduce existing health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  American Indians (AI) have the highest rates of cigarette smoking of any major racial/ethnic group in the US, approaching 40% to 50%. Despite the overall decline in adult smoking prevalence during the past several decades, the young adult (18-29 year olds) age group has the highest prevalence of smoking. We will conduct a randomized trial to test the effectiveness of an internet-based culturally-tailored smoking cessation program among tribal college students.            ",Web-based Smoking Cessation Program for Tribal College Students,8470021,R01CA174481,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Alien ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Conceptions ', ' Scotine ', ' 2-Pyrrolidinone, 1-methyl-5-(3-pyridinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Cotinine ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Feedback ', ' Habits ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart ', ' Marketing ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Tribes ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' enhancing factor ', ' base ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Smoker ', ' Life ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' programs ', ' Salivary ', ' Healthy diet ', ' Diet good ', ' psychosocial ', ' meetings ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' high school ', ' intervention program ', ' Cigarette ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' high school senior ', ' 12th grade ', ' twelfth grade ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Reporting ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' tribal university ', ' tribal college ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2013,586138,0.21361444884608607
"A Social Ecological Based Smoking Cessation Intervention in Public Housing   African American (AA) women in urban, poverty-stricken neighborhoods have high rates of smoking, difficulties with quitting, and disproportionate tobacco related health disparities. AA women who smoke are twice as likely to die from cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer as other ethnic groups. Assisting this underserved population to quit smoking is a national health priority. Recommendations call for more comprehensive, participatory, and multi-level approaches that address social context (i.e., culture, social networks, and neighborhoods) in lifestyle behavioral interventions.  The broad, long-term objectives of this research are to optimize smoking cessation outcomes and to reduce associated health disparities in AA women who live in Southeastern US public housing neighborhoods. Using a participatory and social ecological approach, the academic investigators, advisory board, and public housing residents have developed a multi-level intervention (a.k.a. Sister to Sister) that has demonstrated feasibility and potential effectiveness in increasing short-term cessation outcomes. The primary aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of this bundled intervention on long-term (6- and 12-month) cessation outcomes in women in public housing neighborhoods.  We will pair-match 14 public housing neighborhoods and randomly assign one neighborhood in each pair (7 per condition) to either a treatment condition (Sister to Sister) or a control condition. We project 203 smokers for treatment and 203 smokers for control, a total of 406 participants (29 per neighborhood), will be required at baseline to detect proposed treatment effects for the primary outcome of smoking cessation. Treatment participants will receive the 24-week, bundled Sister to Sister Intervention consisting of: a) individual level strategies with 1:1 community health worker contact to enhance smoking cessation self-efficacy and spiritual well-being; b) interpersonal level strategies with behavioral counseling in small peer groups to enhance social support; c) neighborhood level strategies with policy and counter-marketing campaigns led by a neighborhood advisory board; and, d) an 8-week supply of nicotine patches and study-specific written cessation materials. Control participants will receive written cessation materials at baseline (Pathways to Freedom) and mailed written cessation materials at weeks 6, 12, and 18. In accordance with community preferences, the control participants will be offered a delayed intervention at the end of the study. Secondary aims are to test the effect of intervention mediators (self-efficacy, spiritual well-being, social support, cessation resources) and moderators (perceived stress, social influences, social ties, neighborhood cohesion, neighborhood smoking prevalence, neighborhood stress) on cessation outcomes. Measures will be assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Demonstrating success with this socio-cultural, multi-level approach may lead to wide-scale dissemination and adoption, and decrease disparities of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality in AA females.   African American women in public housing neighborhoods have high rates of smoking and difficulties in quitting.

"Developing a Culturally Relevant Model of Smoking Cessation among Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Yessenia Castro, Ph.D., is a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Health Disparities Research at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). She is seeking five years of funding through the National Cancer Institute's Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to Promote Diversity (K01). Dr. Castro conducts research examining social, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and cultural determinants of smoking cessation in minority and underserved populations under the mentorship of Dr. David Wetter. MDACC provides an unusually rich training environment that includes an extraordinary number of workshops, seminars, and courses; outstanding opportunities for developing skills in grant writing, publication, and project management; and superb resources for assisting young investigators.     Dr. Castro's long term career goals are to serve as an independent, research-oriented faculty member in a university environment, and to develop a program of research focused on understanding culturally relevant influences of cancer risk behaviors, with a particular focus on smoking among Latinos. Such a program could improve smoking cessation interventions tailored for or targeted at Latinos, and ultimately aid in eliminating health disparities among this population.     In the current proposal, Dr. Castro delineates four short term goals to be achieved throughout the award period that are intended to serve as the foundation for an independent research career. These are: 1) accumulate a strong knowledge base in the social, cognitive, and affective mechanisms and processes involved in tobacco dependence and cessation among underserved adult populations; 2)extend her current knowledge of research on gender and race/ethnicity into the area of cancer prevention; particularly, smoking cessation among Latinos; 3) gain knowledge and experience in culturally competent community level research from a public health perspective, and; 4) learn the appropriate statistical methods and modeling techniques for evaluating complex longitudinal data. These goals will be achieved through a combination of: 1) rigorous formal coursework and directed readings; 2) numerous professional development experiences; 3) numerous project implementation, data analysis, and manuscript writing/publication experiences, and; 4) intensive mentoring by a team of highly successful scientists with diverse expertise, such that each mentor can provide invaluable guidance in achieving a specific short term goal, but most can advise about more than one goal.     The proposed research plan seeks to address the paucity of existing research addressing the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation among Latinos. Research in addictions and health behavior has identified a number of individual-level factors that are key determinants of smoking cessation including social/environmental, inter-/intrapersonal, and cognitive/affective factors. Emerging research suggests that many of the known determinants of smoking cessation may be of equal importance to minority smokers, but more research is needed in this area, as noted by several prominent publications including the Surgeon General's Report and the Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence Clinical Practice Guideline. Further, with the exception of data addressing the influence of acculturation on smoking prevalence, almost nothing is known about the effect of acculturation and other culturally relevant variables (e.g., acculturative stress, perceived discrimination) on the process of smoking cessation. Thus, the proposed project will utilize data from three longitudinal studies of Latino smokers to examine the impact of culturally relevant factors on mechanisms of smoking cessation. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a comprehensive conceptual model linking cultural factors to mechanisms of smoking cessation that is informed by previous work addressing the impact of culture on mental and physical health, socioeconomic status influences on health, and theories of addictive behaviors. Additionally, the project will evaluate specific, fine-grained hypotheses using data collected with state-of-the-science ecological momentary assessment techniques.        Although Latinos are less likely to smoke, they exhibit more difficulty quitting, are less likely to seek or receive help with quitting, and are at high risk of developing tobacco related chronic illnesses. Further, very little is known about the determinants of smoking cessation among Latinos, or how factors specific to minority status influence determinants of cessation. Advancing knowledge in these areas would help to identify treatment targets, improve current smoking cessation interventions, and ultimately aid in eliminating health disparities among Latinos.

"Community-Partnered Tobacco Control in Underserved Dominican Republic Communities  The globalization of the tobacco epidemic poses significant morbidity and mortality burdens, with the brunt of impact increasingly borne by low-middle income countries. Research partnerships between investigators from high-income countries with well developed tobacco control research programs and their counterparts in low-middle income countries are needed to effectively address this global public health crisis. The Dominican Republic (DR) is a key site that mirrors the trends in Latin America: it is a low-middle income tobacco growing country with significant tobacco use and high levels of secondhand smoke exposure, and it is at a very early stage of tobacco control. The proposed project will assess baseline knowledge, attitudes, exposures, and behaviors regarding tobacco use and secondhand smoke, provide a randomized controlled trial of community-partnered interventions around secondhand smoke and tobacco cessation, and develop and implement a dissemination plan for national and regional impact and translation of methods and results to other underserved groups as appropriate. A multimethod assessment approach will be used, to include qualitative community assessments (RAPs), a series of quantitative surveys (household surveillances, community and smoker cohort surveys, and health care provider surveys), and a biomarker assessment of secondhand smoke exposure. Eight economically disadvantaged communities will be randomized to intervention or control conditions in a lagged treatment design; interventions will be developed and implemented based on the evidence base from other countries and from a current DR trial, and on input from national and local DR workgroups using a community partnered approach. The intervention is hypothesized to decrease tobacco use rates, increase the number of smokefree homes, denormalize smoking, increase awareness of and change attitudes regarding tobacco use and secondhand smoke risks, decrease exposure to secondhand smoke, and increase health care provider intervention in intervention- relative to control communities, with differences by geographic and demographic characteristics to be examined. The project will also engage international, national, and local DR workgroups to maintain communication of findings to key partners, host a national DR tobacco control conference with regional representation, and develop other action steps for local and regional dissemination of findings and evidence based interventions, resources, and infrastructures. Finally, the project will coordinate with the University of Rochester Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute for translation of current evidence based approaches and methodologies for implementation in the DR, and to explore whether any methodologies or interventions from the proposed trial in the DR can be translated to underserved groups in the United States. Effectively engaging early stage low-middle income countries in tobacco control research will be critical to reducing tobacco use and the burden of tobacco-caused illnesses globally.  Project Narrative Tobacco use and tobacco-caused illnesses and death are increasing in developing countries globally, so it is critical to study these countries in order to effectively address the tobacco epidemic. The proposed project will test the effectiveness of community- based interventions for secondhand smoke and quitting smoking in eight underserved communities in the Dominican Republic. The project will also partner with communities and national and international groups to determine whether the methods and interventions from this study in the Dominican Republic can also be used to help other countries in the region and underserved groups in the United States.",Community-Partnered Tobacco Control in Underserved Dominican Republic Communities,8507467,R01CA132950,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Dominican Republic ', ' Epidemic ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Institutes ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Language ', ' Latin America ', ' Learning ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' PAHO ', ' Pan American Health Organization ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Smoking ', ' Societies ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' experience ', ' international center ', ' cohort ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' secondhand smoke ', ' second hand smoke ', ' environmental tobacco smoke exposure ', ' Environmental Tobacco Smoke ', ' Regulation ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' global health ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Intervention Community Trial ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Tobacco Control Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' women of childbearing age ', ' women of child bearing age ', ' Female of childbearing age ', ' Female of child bearing age ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' tobacco abstinence ', ' tobacco control ', ' community intervention ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community based participatory research ', ' provider intervention ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2013,465795,0.14343660195320035
"Project Impact: A Culturally-Tailored Adherence Intervention for Latino Smokers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2009, tobacco use was implicated in 438,000 deaths in the U.S. and over 80% of lung cancers were attributed to smoking. Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer death for Latino men and the second leading cause for Latina women. Several pharmacological treatments for smoking cessation have been shown to be effective at improving tobacco abstinence rates, including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Despite the availability of these efficacious treatments, adherence to treatment is a significant barrier for Latinos. Developing novel, effective and culturally targeted interventions that increase NRT adherence among Latinos can ultimately inform clinical practice and improve the cessation rates of Latino smokers seeking to quit. The current study seeks to develop and test a culturally tailored medication adherence intervention that will include text messaging and behavioral components that target the unique needs of Latino smokers. These novel and targeted components will address misperceptions and barriers related to NRT treatment and offer real-time reminders and informational prompts to enhance adherence. In the initial development phase of the research, qualitative methods will be used to develop the Latino-targeted components of the intervention. During the clinical trial phase of the study, 98 Latino smokers interested in quitting will be randomized to one of two groups - Culturally Tailored Adherence (CTA), or 2) Standard Medication Management (SMM). All participants will receive 12 weeks of NRT and will receive ongoing assessments of NRT adherence, tobacco abstinence, and will be assessed on the constructs of our theoretical model (e.g. motivation or behavioral skills). The proposed study will be conducted in the context of a five-year career development program that will provide advanced training in Latino smoking cessation and health, qualitative methods, adherence interventions, tobacco addiction and cessation, and the use of technology in healthcare. The proposed training and research plans aim to promote the applicant's long-term career goal of establishing an independently-funded program of tobacco research with a focus on Latino populations. A comprehensive training plan is proposed, combining mentored research, structured mentorship activities guided by established researchers in the field, formal coursework and workshops, and participation in seminars at Brown University and Butler Hospital.          Considering the high rates of non-adherence among Latino smokers involved in smoking cessation treatment, the proposed study addresses several public health concerns related to smoking cessation, cancer, and health disparities among Latinos.

"Correlates of Nicotine Dependence among Urban African American Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities continue to exist between and within populations and little is known about the causes of population differences observed in tobacco use, nicotine dependence, and related diseases. More importantly, an age-race paradox exists in which African American youth consistently report lower prevalence of tobacco use than their Caucasian counterparts, yet African American adult smokers suffer a disproportionate burden of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. Nicotine dependence is the most formidable impediment to quitting smoking among adolescents. Despite the recognition of the central role of nicotine dependence in smoking cessation, there is a paucity of information about how nicotine dependence is expressed among youth who smoke. For these reasons, researchers have called for additional research to address the insufficient understanding of and gap in the literature on adolescent nicotine dependence and its impact on cessation. Thus, I describe a plan to examine critical factors of nicotine dependence among urban African American youth utilizing individual and group (class) trajectory analysis (Study 1) as well as mixed methods research, including a validated measure of nicotine dependence, focus groups, and in-depth interviews (Study 2) to elucidate the complexities of adolescent nicotine dependence.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans bear the greatest burden of death and illness due to cigarette smoking. Most adults began smoking as adolescents and nicotine dependence is a critical barrier in quitting smoking. This Award will allow me to examine the nicotine dependence experiences of both adults and youth to better understand how we can help African American youth quit smoking.

"Motivating Smokers with Mobility Impairments to Quit Smoking  Abstract  People with physical disabilities experience similar health disparities as other disadvantaged groups (e.g., no insurance, decreased access to medical and preventive care, more co-morbidities) but significantly less attention is paid to their health promotion. While smoking cessation interventions have been developed for other disadvantaged groups, none exist for people with physical disabilities. People with physical disabilities (mobility impairments) who use assistance to ambulate have higher smoking rates (32.5%) than people who have a disability and do not need assistance (23%) and people who are not disabled (19.8%; Brawarsky et al. 2002). The aims of the current study are to: 1) develop a series of theory-based intervention DVDs focused on motivating smoking cessation among people with mobility impairments (i.e., chronically use some type of assistance to walk such as walker, cane, wheelchair, braces, etc) and 2) test the efficacy of the Intervention DVDs vs. Print-based Standard Care among 560 smokers with mobility impairments in a randomized trial. The materials in both groups will be mailed on a monthly basis for four months, and are organized in separate sections according to readiness to quit. Participants in both groups will receive a) nicotine patches at no cost if they are ready to quit and b) brief phone calls (~5 minutes) between mailings to assess and encourage viewing the materials. We hypothesize that smokers who are randomized to receive the Intervention DVDs will be significantly more likely to achieve 7-day and 30-day point-prevalence abstinence at 1, 6, and 12- month follow-ups vs. those who receive Print-based Standard Care. The Intervention DVDs will be based on Behavioral Activation Theory, and address specific barriers to quitting in this population (increased stress, decreased positive affect, increased depressed mood, activity restriction, and self-efficacy). We hypothesize that the intervention will impact these mediators directly, as well as indirectly through Behavioral Activation (goal setting and pleasant events). Our series of preliminary studies support the use of these mediators for people with mobility impairments and the use of DVDs as an acceptable mode of intervention, given the economic and mobility limitations of this population. If effective, our DVD intervention could have a high level of public health and clinical significance, as it could be easily disseminated at low cost through national disability-related organizations, networks of independent living centers, or physician offices, and substantially improve the health and quality of life for people with physical disabilities. This study is innovative because no studies have targeted this population, it applies Behavioral Activation Theory to smoking cessation, and it examines relatively novel mediators in the field of smoking (e.g., positive affect, behavioral activation).  Narrative No smoking cessation interventions exist that target smokers with mobility impairments, though 32.5% of this population smokes. The current study aims to develop theory-based Intervention DVD's for smoking cessation for people with mobility impairments and test its efficacy for increasing smoking cessation vs. print-based standard care in a randomized trial.",Motivating Smokers with Mobility Impairments to Quit Smoking,8474707,R01CA137616,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Braces ', ' Braces-Orthopedic appliances ', ' Walking Sticks ', ' Canes ', ' cane, includes canes of all materials, adjustable or fixed, with tip ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Independent Living ', ' Insurance ', ' literacy ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Mails ', ' Maintenance ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Motivation ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', "" Physicians' Offices "", ' Printing ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Target Populations ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Time ', ' Walkers ', ' mobile assistive system ', ' mobile assistive device ', ' mobile assistance system ', ' mobile assistance device ', ' Wheel Chairs ', ' Wheelchairs ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' disability ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Smoker ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' nicotine patch ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' self help ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' Abstinence ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' group intervention ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NCI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R01,2013,527223,0.23036027888124114
"Culturally Targeted & Individually Tailored Smoking Cessation Study: LGBT Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goals are to increase smoking cessation in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) smokers and to understand the processes related to cessation and relapse in this underserved population. Conducted in two phases, the primary aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of a culturally targeted intervention versus a non-targeted intervention on smoking cessation outcomes in LGBT smokers. Further aims are to determine the effect of the ALA-CT intervention on individually mediated predictors of cessation and to explore the underlying cultural and psychosocial mechanisms through which the ALA-CT intervention has an impact (differential or not) on smoking cessation. In Phase I, we will use focus groups and a pilot trial to establish the cultural appropriateness and acceptability of the targeted elements of the intervention. In Phase 2, we will conduct a randomized smoking cessation trial to compare for the first time the efficacy of the American Lung Association's 'Freedom from Smoking Program' (ALA-FFS). Culturally targeted (ALA-CT) and Non-Targeted (Standard ALA-FFS) to LGBT smokers. The ALA-CT will consist of 7 culturally targeted (psychosocial and cultural) group counseling sessions combined with nicotine replacement and peer support. The contrast condition will be smokers who receive the non-targeted ALA-FFS program, nicotine replacement and peer support. The primary smoking cessation outcome will be point prevalence abstinence, i.e., no smoking, not even a puff, for previous 7 days, and will be assessed by Timeline Follow-Back derived measures for prolonged abstinence and point prevalence quit rates. Reported outcomes will be objectively verified [Carbon monoxide (CO) testing] at 1 month, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months follow-up to determine short and longer- term cessation outcomes. We will control for demographic variables that have known associations with smoking outcomes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate the benefits of culturally targeted smoking cessation intervention for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender smokers.

"Implementing tobacco use treatment guidelines in dental public health clinics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. The 2008 Public Health Service Guideline (PHS), Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence provides strong evidence that brief advice combined with assistance such as counseling and pharmacotherapy, can significantly increase quit rates. Unfortunately, provider adherence to Guideline recommendations is poor. Inadequate implementation of the Guideline in practice settings, particularly those serving ethnic minorities and other vulnerable populations, has contributed to growing disparities in smoking prevalence and tobacco-related illness. This proposal addresses this research-to-practice gap by examining the effectiveness of three practical and highly replicable strategies for implementing evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of tobacco dependence in dental public health clinics. Dental providers have a credible and central role in providing tobacco cessation services. The majority of smokers see a dentist annually and tobacco use is a known risk factor for oral disease. Moreover, controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy and effectiveness of dental office-based cessation interventions. Yet dental care settings remain a relatively untapped venue for the treatment of tobacco dependence. In order to integrate evidence-based tobacco cessation treatment into routine dental practice, optimal implementation processes and strategies must be identified. We propose a 3-arm, cluster randomized controlled trial that will 1) Compare the effectiveness and cost of three promising strategies for implementation of the PHS tobacco use treatment guidelines: a) Staff training and current best practices (CBP); 2) CBP + provider performance feedback (PF) and 3) CBP + PF + provider reimbursement for delivery of tobacco cessation treatment (pay for performance) on provider adherence to recommended guidelines for tobacco use treatment; 2) Use a mixed-methods approach to examine potential theory-driven mechanisms at the organizational and provider level hypothesized to explain the comparative effectiveness of three strategies for implementation; and 3) Identify baseline organizational factors that influence the implementation of evidence-based tobacco use treatment practices in dental clinics. The trial will be conducted in 18 public dental care clinics and information about implementation outcomes and processes will be derived from multiple data sources (patient exit interviews, provider surveys and semi- structured interviews). Guided by a conceptual framework that emphasizes provider beliefs and organizational characteristics, we will identify factors that influence the implementation process in dental clinics. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to provide critical new knowledge to facilitate the widespread adoption, implementation, dissemination and sustained utilization of evidence-based tobacco use treatment strategies in dental practices across the U.S.         ",Implementing tobacco use treatment guidelines in dental public health clinics,8448614,R01CA162035,"['Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' effectiveness research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' provider intervention ', ' research into practice ', ' research to practice ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' financial incentive ', ' brief advice ', ' arm ', ' Adoption ', ' Belief ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Sources ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Clinics ', ' Dental Offices ', ' Dentists ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Feedback ', ' dental practice ', ' Dental General Practice ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoking ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Tobacco ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' United States ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' Reminder Systems ', ' Process Measure ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Structure ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' trial design ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' ']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2013,703189,0.08077871866484744
"Understanding Disparities in Quitting in African American and White Smokers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial/ethnic differences in smoking are well documented; African Americans smoke fewer cigarettes per day than Whites but experience disproportionately greater smoking attributable morbidity and mortality. Well documented disparities also exist in smoking cessation with African Americans consistently quitting at lower rates than Whites. However, to-date, no adequately powered study, stratified on race, has been conducted to confirm this finding using a rigorous study design or to understand the mechanisms accounting for differential quit rates in African Americans relative to Whites. The objectives of this application are to 1) describe the differences in smoking cessation among AA and White smokers treated with varenicline, 2) identify the smoking, psychosocial, treatment process, and biological factors that independently explain the relationship between race/ethnicity and cotinine-verified 7-day abstinence in African American and White smokers, and 3) examine the side effect profile of varenicline by smoking level. These aims will be accomplished through a prospective cohort intervention study, stratified on race, age (< 40, > 40), and gender among 448 participants (224 African American, 224 White). All participants will receive 3 months of varenicline, the most effective of currently available smoking cessation medications, standard educational materials, and six sessions of smoking cessation counseling. This study is innovative. It will be the first known study to report on the use of varenicline in As, the first to examine varenicline in light smokers (<10 cpd) and among a wide range of smoking levels (3-20 cpd), the first head-to-head study, stratified on race, designed to prospectively compare pharmacotherapy in AAs versus Whites, and one of a few to explore mechanisms underlying disparities in quitting between AA and White smokers. The impact of these findings will be considerable, having ramifications for treatment, clinical practice, and policy. Significan knowledge will be gained about African American-White differences in quitting. Findings have the potential to improve tobacco use treatment by moving the field away from a generic focus on race/ethnicity toward a targeted focus on modifiable smoking, psychosocial, and treatment process factors most relevant to African Americans and to Whites.          African Americans smoking fewer cigarettes per day and experience greater smoking-related disease and death, yet consistently quit smoking at lower rates than Whites. Little is known about the reasons for this disparity. This study will examine mechanisms explaining lower quit rates in African Americans relative to Whites and has the potential to significantly improve tobacco use treatment outcomes by identifying specific barriers and facilitators to quitting smoking for African Americans and for Whites.

"Behavioral and Environmental Contributors to Tobacco Disparities in Rural Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use in rural populations is a pressing public health issue. Individuals living in rural areas suffer disproportionately from tobacco use, with cross-sectional surveys consistently showing higher prevalence rates of cigarette smoking and smokeless tobacco use in rural areas compared to metropolitan areas. While the scientific knowledge about adolescent tobacco use has grown significantly in the past several decades, most of this knowledge is based primarily on youth living in urban areas. The proposed work utilizes over a decade of existing longitudinal data from Minnesota to characterize important factors that may contribute to tobacco-related disparities in rural communities. The aims of the current proposal are to: (1) examine differences in the progression of cigarette smoking and smokeless tobacco use among rural and metropolitan youth during adolescence and young adulthood and (2) assess how the social and tobacco control environments differ in rural and metropolitan areas, and how these account for differences in rates and patterns of smoking among rural and metropolitan youth. Youth in rural areas are hypothesized to show higher rates of initiation and at earlier ages, heavier use patterns, fewer quit attempts, and lower rates of cessation compared to metropolitan youth. Rural youth are further hypothesized to report higher levels of smoking among their social networks, greater social acceptability of smoking, greater access to tobacco, and exposure to fewer tobacco control policies than youth in metropolitan areas and that these factors will relate to heavier patterns of use among rural youth. We will also examine if factors associated with differences in rates of tobacco use among rural and metropolitan youth are comparable in a large diverse sample of youth from Florida. We hypothesize that the factors associated with differences in rates of smoking among rural and metropolitan youth in Minnesota will be comparable in Florida. The proposed approach is innovative because it includes a repeated measures design with a large sample of youth from rural and metropolitan areas, along with detailed and frequent data about tobacco use behaviors from adolescence to young adulthood, as well as links between behavior and a multitude of social factors that may affect tobacco use and cessation among rural youth. The proposed project is expected to advance our understanding of tobacco-related disparities among rural youth by providing a detailed understanding of factors associated with tobacco disparities in rural youth that have been observed in cross-sectional studies. Importantly, the proposed project will provide an evidence base for designing effective interventions aimed at reducing tobacco use in rural populations.

"Relationship between tobacco retailer density and sexual minority couples     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use is substantially higher among sexual minorities than among heterosexuals. The reasons for this persistent disparity remain unclear, but the high toll of death and disability from tobacco use creates substantial health inequalities in cancer. Same-sex couples' movement within the U.S. results in same-sex couples concentrating in more urban neighborhoods where there may be more tobacco retailers. Living near a tobacco retailer has been associated with decreased success in quitting tobacco. The presence or absence of overlapping patterns of same-sex couples and tobacco retailers have not been explored. This study uses a unique and high quality list of 92,384 tobacco retailers from 97 U.S. counties with 18,034 census tracts and data from the U.S. Census to examine the relationship between same-sex couple density and tobacco retailer density in census tracts. The analysis uses geographical information systems (GIS) software that allows for buffering census tract areas to create a measure of tract tobacco retailer density. This relationship is tested usin spatial regression models to account for non-independence due to geographic proximity. The relationship is then examined to see if it is the result of other, confounding census tract characteristics. A multiple mediation approach is proposed to examine if the relationship between tobacco retailer density and same-sex couple density is confounded by tract characteristics such as urbanicity, income, and racial/ethnic composition.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sexual minorities are more likely to use tobacco products than heterosexuals. The reasons for this disparity are unknown; however, where people live and their proximity to tobacco retailers can influence decisions to quit smoking. This study examines overlapping patterns of tobacco retailers and same-sex couples to examine the potential role of tobacco retailer density in sexual minority tobacco disparities.            ",Relationship between tobacco retailer density and sexual minority couples,8781905,F31CA186434,"['Accounting ', ' Buffers ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Censuses ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Couples ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Female ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', ' Internal Migrations ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Ownership ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Smoke ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Spatial Distribution ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' density ', ' urban area ', ' Area ', ' disability ', ' Licensing ', ' Policies ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Life ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' success ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' land use ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' Coupled ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' health inequalities ', ' sexual minority ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2014,29172,0.12346818042825493
"Correlates of Nicotine Dependence among Urban African American Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities continue to exist between and within populations and little is known about the causes of population differences observed in tobacco use, nicotine dependence, and related diseases. More importantly, an age-race paradox exists in which African American youth consistently report lower prevalence of tobacco use than their Caucasian counterparts, yet African American adult smokers suffer a disproportionate burden of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. Nicotine dependence is the most formidable impediment to quitting smoking among adolescents. Despite the recognition of the central role of nicotine dependence in smoking cessation, there is a paucity of information about how nicotine dependence is expressed among youth who smoke. For these reasons, researchers have called for additional research to address the insufficient understanding of and gap in the literature on adolescent nicotine dependence and its impact on cessation. Thus, I describe a plan to examine critical factors of nicotine dependence among urban African American youth utilizing individual and group (class) trajectory analysis (Study 1) as well as mixed methods research, including a validated measure of nicotine dependence, focus groups, and in-depth interviews (Study 2) to elucidate the complexities of adolescent nicotine dependence.        African Americans bear the greatest burden of death and illness due to cigarette smoking. Most adults began smoking as adolescents and nicotine dependence is a critical barrier in quitting smoking. This Award will allow me to examine the nicotine dependence experiences of both adults and youth to better understand how we can help African American youth quit smoking.

"Unjust Targeting: How Marketing Features Impact Consumer Response and Tobacco Use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research contributes to Tobacco Regulatory Science by connecting (1) tobacco marketing features with (2) consumer affective, cognitive and physiological response to marketing images and (3) tobacco product perceptions and use outcomes in ethnically diverse populations (African American, Asian American, Latino and non-Hispanic white). By identifying key features of tobacco marketing (e.g. colors, descriptors, branding, marketing claims) that optimize consumer response to the marketing and ultimately connecting that to tobacco use outcomes over time, this project adds to the evidence base used to regulate tobacco marketing. This project will provide a comprehensive description of the tobacco marketing landscape and an inventory of 'high impact' tobacco marketing features that produce inequitable outcomes in tobacco use. Additionally, by examining consumers' affective, cognitive and physiologic response to ads, this project will illuminate the underlying mechanisms through which these marketing features operate. The aims of this project are to: (1) describe key features of tobacco marketing targeted towards (a) African Americans, (b) Asian Americans, (c) Latinos (including Mexican Americans, Cubans and Puerto Ricans) and (d) non-Hispanic whites; (2) identify how marketing features impact response to ads for Latinos and Latino subgroups; and (3) for each ethnic group, demonstrate how tobacco product use is initiated and changes as a result of awareness of advertising and having a favorite ad and identify marketing features associated with tobacco product use. To accomplish these aims, the proposed research leverages the infrastructures of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study and the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), linking ad-level data from a PATH ad-hoc study that content codes tobacco marketing images with longitudinal PATH data and conducting an ancillary study to the HCHS/SOL assessing self-report and physiological response to tobacco ads. To execute these aims, I will work with a team of mentors who are internationally known scholars. Dr. John Elder, Professor in the Graduate School of Public Health at San Diego State University will be my primary mentor; Dr. John Pierce, Professor in the Department of Family & Preventive Medicine and Moores Cancer Center at UC-San Diego and a lead investigator on the PATH study and Dr. Lourdes Baezconde-Garbanati, Associate Professor of Preventive Medicine at the University of Southern California and Project Leader on the USC Tobacco Center of Regulatory Sciences (P50) will be secondary mentors. This training will provide me with expertise in longitudinal, epidemiological study design, management and analysis, tobacco use health disparities, tobacco regulatory policy and physiological measurement of ad response. This will facilitate my integration into the Tobacco Regulatory Science community and allow me to achieve my long-term career goal of becoming an independent, leading investigator and expert in Tobacco Regulatory Science with a specific focus on communication-based research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project impacts public health by providing knowledge necessary for the effective regulation of tobacco marketing. By linking specific features of tobacco marketing (e.g. colors, marketing claims, descriptors, branding) to consumers' response to ads and their tobacco product perceptions and use behaviors, this work provides the FDA with insight into how specifically tobacco marketing produces inequitable tobacco use outcomes. Ultimately, this will facilitate tobacco marketing regulations that will result in lower rates of tobacco use and disease and death associated with tobacco use.            ",Unjust Targeting: How Marketing Features Impact Consumer Response and Tobacco Use,8754302,K01DA037903,"['Advertising ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Archives ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' family medicine ', ' Family Practice ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Market Research ', ' Marketing ', ' Mentors ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Perception ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' RQ2 ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Central American ', ' Policies ', ' Research Activity ', ' Measurement ', ' Descriptor ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' South American ', ' Pattern ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' preference ', ' professor ', ' skills ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' risk perception ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dominican ', ' p50 ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily Member 5 Gene ', ' TNFRSF5 ', ' MGC9013 ', ' CDW40 ', ' CD40 ', ' Bp50 ', ' TNFRSF5 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Tobacco Epidemiology ', ' Tobacco Use Epidemiology ', ' Characteristics ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Affective ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' community health study ', ' population health ', ' arm ', ' ']",NIDA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2014,139396,0.11660224081716487
"Sex Differences in the Mechanisms that Promote Nicotine Reward and Withdrawal DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use remains a major public health and economic concern, particularly in women who are more vulnerable to the long-term health consequences of smoking than men. Despite the magnitude of the problem, there is a fundamental knowledge gap in our understanding of the mechanisms that promote tobacco use in females. If this knowledge gap is not filled, then reducing tobacco use and developing specialized medications for female smokers will remain largely incomprehensible. The long-term goal of our research program is to identify the mechanisms that mediate tobacco use among different clinical populations that are uniquely susceptible to this problem. The objective of this renewal is to determine the neural mechanisms that promote tobacco use in females. The central hypothesis is that females are more susceptible to tobacco use than males because of stronger rewarding effects of nicotine and heightened anxiety produced by withdrawal from this drug. Our mechanistic hypothesis is that estradiol (E2) promotes the rewarding effects of nicotine and magnifies the stress produced by nicotine withdrawal in females. More specifically, we postulate that sex differences in response to nicotine are modulated within the neural circuits of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), where dopamine is increased following nicotine administration and decreased during withdrawal from this drug. Thus, females experience greater rewarding effects of nicotine in the presence of E2, which promotes dopamine release in the NAcc. Following repeated nicotine exposure, opponent processes develop to counteract the chronic over-activation of dopamine release. We suggest that the emergence of these opponent processes is evident during withdrawal from chronic nicotine as an increase in the stress hormone, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in the NAcc. This increase in CRF levels enhances the inhibitory tone in the NAcc, which results in a decrease in dopamine release during nicotine withdrawal. Thus, females experience greater anxiety during nicotine withdrawal in the presence of E2, which promotes the recruitment of opponent stress systems that suppress dopamine release in the NAcc. The proposed studies reflect a multi- disciplinary approach involving neurochemical, behavioral, and gene transfer techniques to compare sex differences in the rewarding effects of nicotine (Aim 1) and the aversive states produced by withdrawal (Aim 2) because both of these factors are believed to promote tobacco use in females. The approach to studying sex differences involves comparisons of male, female, and OVX female rats. If the removal of ovarian hormones reverses the proposed measures in females, then the role of E2 will be assessed in OVX rats that will receive E2 supplementation and will be tested following E2 or vehicle administration. At the completion of this project, our findings will help us develop a unifying hypothesis regarding the factors that promote tobacco use in females. This exemplifies the significance of this research because a better understanding of the mechanisms that fuel tobacco use in females will lead to more effective treatments to reduce health disparities in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because our findings will be an important step toward elucidating the neural substrates that promote addiction pathology in women. Thus, our studies are relevant to the mission of NIH to support research aimed at reducing the burden of tobacco abuse, especially in women who are most vulnerable to the long-term effects of tobacco use.",Sex Differences in the Mechanisms that Promote Nicotine Reward and Withdrawal,8848217,R01DA021274,"['Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' corticotropin releasing hormone ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticoliberin ', ' CRF-41 ', ' ACTH-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' 4-(2-Aminoethyl)-1,2-benzenediol ', ' 3,4-Dihydroxyphenethylamine ', ' Dopamine ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17-diol (17beta)- ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estradiol ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hormones ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mission ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neurochemical ', ' neurochemistry ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Nicotine Withdrawal ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Self Administration ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' drug withdrawal ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Microdialysis ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' tobacco abuse ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dependence ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' novel ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' Ovarian hormone ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' response ', ' Transgenesis ', ' Gene Transfer Techniques ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Supplementation ', ' transfer of a gene ', ' Gene Transfer ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' health economics ', ' Population ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Affective ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO,R01,2014,8140,0.09801115594627277
"A trial of Positively Smoke Free group therapy for HIV-infected smokers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are 1.1 million persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the US, 60% of them smoke cigarettes, and 75% of these are interested in quitting. Almost none are currently accessing smoking cessation interventions designed to meet their specific needs and concerns.  Cigarette smoking is responsible for 24% of deaths among PLWH, and 30% of non-AIDS defining malignancies. It is driving the alarming rise in cardiac events and lung cancers in this highly vulnerable population. The lack of access to proven, effective, culturally appropriate tobacco cessation services represents a health disparity of the first order. The psychosocial profile of the PLWH-smoker community, characterized by high rates of psychiatric comorbidity, drug and alcohol use, and low levels of social support, suggests that achieving high cessation rates will be a great challenge.  Positively Smoke Free (PSF) is an intensive, multisession, group cessation program specifically developed for PLWH smokers. A pilot study of PSF yielded promising results. This proposal aims (1) to perform a definitive efficacy study of PSF by comparing 6-month biochemically confirmed abstinence rates in subjects randomized to PSF vs. standard care in a cohort of 450 PLWH smokers, (2) to determine the sociobehavioral moderators and mediators associated with successful cessation, and (3) to complete a careful cost analysis of PSF in order to estimate the incremental cost per quit associated program participation.  If PSF is proven to be effective it will establish a new treatment option for PLWH smokers. Determination of moderators and mediators of program success will provide insight into the mode of action of the intervention and will help guide the development of additional treatment strategies in the future. Finally, the cost analyses will provide critical information abut the feasibility of program dissemination and implementation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic of cigarette smoking is fueling an alarming rise in lung and other cancers in persons living with HIV (PLWH). Smokers living with HIV have few, if any, cessation resources available to them that address their particular needs, and HIV care providers have virtually no evidence base to guide their approach to tobacco treatment.

"Socioeconomic status and smoking exposure in Appalachia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Social inequalities are an important predictor of disease incidence, including cancer. Persons with low socioeconomic status (SES) have increased rates of lung and other tobacco-related cancers. Although smoking prevalence is higher in persons with lower levels of education and occupational status, smoking prevalence does not explain this excess risk. In prospective cohort studies, the associations between low SES and elevated lung cancer risk persist after adjustment for smoking amount and duration. The investigators' overall hypothesis is that the unaccounted increased risk in populations with lower SES is due to higher smoke exposure that cannot be accounted for by self-reported smoking habits. Their previous laboratory studies demonstrate that there is a wide degree of variation in biological exposure to tobacco smoke toxins and carcinogens per cigarette smoked. The investigators propose to conduct a community-based participatory study in the medically underserved area of Appalachian Pennsylvania to determine the relationship between SES and the dose of inhaled mainstream smoke and the dose of biological markers of tobacco smoke exposure. Specific aims are: Specific Aim 1. Determine whether SES is associated with smoking puffing behaviors including puff volume, duration, interval, and length of cigarette smoked. Specific Aim 2. Determine whether SES is associated with biomarkers of smoking exposure including salivary cotinine and expired carbon monoxide. This addresses the SES hypothesis using biological measures of dose in addition to environmental measures such as puffing dose. Specific Aim 3. Correlate environmental and biological measures of smoke exposure. This aim will determine whether levels of mainstream smoke exposure, as estimated by puffing profiles are determinants of the biological levels of cigarette smoke exposure, and whether this relationship differs by SES. This brings together aims 1 and 2 to comprehensively address the SES hypothesis. Specific Aim 4. Determine the effects of psychological stress, as assessed by psychological scales and salivary stress biomarkers, on smoking puffing parameters and salivary cotinine levels. The proposed research study will be conducted in Appalachia, Pennsylvania (PA), a NIH-designated medically underserved but socioeconomically diverse population. The investigators predict that lower SES is associated with higher smoke intake as determined by topography and smoke biomarkers, and that this finding will help to explain the long-observed patterns of lung cancer incidence disparities.        A major objective of cancer control efforts is to understand the causes of social inequalities in cancer rates. Cigarette smokers of lower socioeconomic status (SES) have increased rates of lung cancer and other tobacco-related diseases than smokers of higher SES. Because smoking is a modifiable behavior, findings that demonstrate more intensive smoking and greater exposure to tobacco smoke among low SES smokers may be helpful in developing more effective and targeted smoking control efforts.

"Understanding Disparities in Quitting in African American and White Smokers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial/ethnic differences in smoking are well documented; African Americans smoke fewer cigarettes per day than Whites but experience disproportionately greater smoking attributable morbidity and mortality. Well documented disparities also exist in smoking cessation with African Americans consistently quitting at lower rates than Whites. However, to-date, no adequately powered study, stratified on race, has been conducted to confirm this finding using a rigorous study design or to understand the mechanisms accounting for differential quit rates in African Americans relative to Whites. The objectives of this application are to 1) describe the differences in smoking cessation among AA and White smokers treated with varenicline, 2) identify the smoking, psychosocial, treatment process, and biological factors that independently explain the relationship between race/ethnicity and cotinine-verified 7-day abstinence in African American and White smokers, and 3) examine the side effect profile of varenicline by smoking level. These aims will be accomplished through a prospective cohort intervention study, stratified on race, age (< 40, > 40), and gender among 448 participants (224 African American, 224 White). All participants will receive 3 months of varenicline, the most effective of currently available smoking cessation medications, standard educational materials, and six sessions of smoking cessation counseling. This study is innovative. It will be the first known study to report on the use of varenicline in As, the first to examine varenicline in light smokers (<10 cpd) and among a wide range of smoking levels (3-20 cpd), the first head-to-head study, stratified on race, designed to prospectively compare pharmacotherapy in AAs versus Whites, and one of a few to explore mechanisms underlying disparities in quitting between AA and White smokers. The impact of these findings will be considerable, having ramifications for treatment, clinical practice, and policy. Significan knowledge will be gained about African American-White differences in quitting. Findings have the potential to improve tobacco use treatment by moving the field away from a generic focus on race/ethnicity toward a targeted focus on modifiable smoking, psychosocial, and treatment process factors most relevant to African Americans and to Whites.          African Americans smoking fewer cigarettes per day and experience greater smoking-related disease and death, yet consistently quit smoking at lower rates than Whites. Little is known about the reasons for this disparity. This study will examine mechanisms explaining lower quit rates in African Americans relative to Whites and has the potential to significantly improve tobacco use treatment outcomes by identifying specific barriers and facilitators to quitting smoking for African Americans and for Whites.

"Reducing socioeconomic disparities in tobacco dependence treatment outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tobacco use is a leading contributor to racial and socioeconomic health disparities in the US primarily due to an unequal burden of tobacco-related disease from a disproportionate share of smokers in lower socioeconomic (SES) groups in which minorities, particularly African Americans, are disproportionately represented.1-5 Although deemed effective for all smokers,6 the standard cognitive-behavioral treatment for tobacco dependence is significantly less effective for lower SES smokers.7-15 Tobacco dependence treatment, however, has the potential to reduce racial and socioeconomic disparities in achieving long-term abstinence by proactively providing our most at-risk smokers with the specific treatment components they need to achieve abstinence through the existing extensive treatment delivery system.16, 17 Our preliminary studies indicate that in addition to several socio-cultural barriers to engaging in treatment,18 there are several key factors associated with socioeconomic disparities in relapse rates and thus treatment outcomes. These factors include: stress, negative affect, smoking in response to negative affect, delay discounting, locus of control, impulsiveness, exposure to smokers in the environment, and treatment utilization (see Table 1).19, 20 Based on this and other evidence, our overall goal is to revise the standard treatment with specific, evidence-based, cognitive-behavioral strategies to address these key factors as well as target and tailor the approach to more fully meet the needs of lower SES and minority smokers, thereby reducing treatment outcome disparities. We expect: 1) The revised treatment (RT) to reduce socioeconomic disparities in treatment outcomes, and 2) Participants treated with the RT to demonstrate more improvement on each of the key factors associated with disparities than those treated with standard treatment (ST). The specific aims include: 1) Complete a revised draft of a widely utilized standard treatment manual that addresses each of the key factors with treatment components. This aim is partially accomplished (see Appendix for preliminary draft). 2) Using the PEN-3 Model,21-23 target and tailor the daft RT to more fully represent the experiences of smokers who are of lower SES and /or of minority status, particularly African American smokers. 3) Pilot test the targeted/tailored draft RT with three treatment groups (n=5-10 per group) to assess understandability and acceptability and to ensure that it can be delivered in the same timeframe as the ST. 4) Compare the effects of SES on treatment outcomes with socioeconomically and racially diverse participants treated with ST (n=110) and RT (n=110) in a randomized treatment design. 5) Compare the effects of treatment condition on each of the key factors. This innovative approach refines, improves upon, and applies theoretically derived and empirically supported concepts and strategies. If effective at reducing treatment outcome disparities, the manual-driven RT will be easily disseminable as a ""new"" standard, having a sustained and powerful impact on the field and contributing to a reduction in the magnitude of the present tobacco-related racial and socioeconomic health disparities.           Tobacco use is a leading contributor to racial and socioeconomic health disparities in the US primarily due to an unequal burden of tobacco-related disease from a disproportionate share of smokers in African American and lower socioeconomic (SES) groups. Unlike many other health risk behaviors, tobacco-related health disparities are increasing despite a large treatment network of free telephone and in-person counseling services, perhaps due to significant disparities in treatment outcomes. The goal of this project is to revise the standard treatment for tobacco dependence to address key factors associated with treatment outcome disparities and more fully meet the needs of lower SES and African American smokers thereby reducing socioeconomic disparities in tobacco dependence treatment outcomes, halting the alarming increase in tobacco-related health disparities, and reducing a leading cause of racial and socioeconomic health disparities in the US.

"Enhancing cancer outreach for low-income adults with innovative smoking cessation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence indicates that the prevalence of current cigarette smoking among adults in the US has dropped below 20%. While this drop is encouraging, smoking still represents the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the US. Moreover, smoking prevalence is significantly higher among certain population groups, such as those with low levels of education and those living at, or below the poverty level. Therefore, efforts to target these underserved populations with efficacious smoking cessation treatments represents a vital public health effort. The overarching goal of this group-randomized trial is to design and evaluate a novel smoking cessation program targeted to uninsured and underinsured individuals. Key elements of the proposed study will be the use of an established network of community sites (e.g., community centers and churches) and a mobile unit, enabling us to reach individuals confronted with significant barriers to utilizing more traditional smoking cessation treatment approaches.       Specific aims of the study will be to: 1) Compare the efficacy of three smoking cessation interventions targeting community based low income uninsured and underinsured individuals in a group-randomized trial. The interventions will include a Standard Care (SC) approach, consisting of brief advice to quit smoking, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and self-help written materials; an Enhanced Care (EC) approach, consisting of the standard care components plus a single health feedback and motivational interviewing counseling session and a cell phone-delivered text/graphical messaging component; and an Intensive Care (IC) approach, consisting of all SC and EC components plus a series of 11 cell phone-delivered proactive counseling sessions and a cell phone-delivered text/graphical messaging component; 2) Evaluate the role of quit motivation, nicotine withdrawal, risk perception, self- efficacy, social support, and negative affect as potential mediators of smoking abstinence; and 3) Compare the cost-effectiveness of the three treatment conditions.       We believe that of the three conditions, the IC will most successfully address the needs of low-income smokers for several reasons. First, the IC program will be personalized, individualized, and equipped with an intensive, extended counseling and support module provided over the cell phone. Second, the program will combine three intervention components featuring high potential for maintaining support and motivation to quit and prevent relapse. Third, the IC intervention makes use of cell phone technology - an approach that has demonstrated feasibility and efficacy among low-income smokers in previous research conducted by the investigative team. The proposed study offers a number of features (proximity of services to the place of residence, provision of cell phones, etc.) that are likely to reduce treatment barriers while enhancing participant recruitment and retention.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will use an existing network of community sites and a mobile unit to deliver smoking cessation treatment to a multiethnic population of uninsured and underinsured adults living in the greater Houston, Texas metropolitan area. The treatments will include components such as brief advice to quit, nicotine patch, written materials, motivational interviewing/health feedback counseling, text/pix messaging, and proactive cell phone counseling.

"Yale SCOR on Gender-Sensitive Treatment for Tobacco Dependence     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Yale-SCOR is bringing together leading basic and clinical science experts to establish an interdisciplinary, translational, cross-species program of research aimed at identifying novel therapeutics to address the critical health disparity that female smokers face. Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States. Women, compared to men, have poorer rates of smoking cessation, exacerbated health risks, and FDA-approved medications for smoking cessation may not be as effective for women or have emerging limits due to side effects. However, few attempts have been made to develop gender-sensitive smoking cessation treatments. The considerable body of data suggesting that women are more likely to smoke to regulate negative affect and stress while men are more likely to smoke for the reinforcing properties of nicotine suggests an important direction in the development of a new approach to smoking cessation treatments. Using both preclinical and clinical strategies, our interdisciplinary team will probe te noradrenergic system's effects on stress-reactivity and nicotine reinforcement -hypothesizing that (a) different brain systems modulated by noradrenergic activity are activated by smoking in women and men, and (b) guanfacine (an alpha-2a noradrenergic agonist) can preferentially target these gender-sensitive systems to improve smoking cessation outcomes. Using a translational approach with an interdisciplinary team effort, we are proposing three projects that will have inter-related and shared goals, with each providing unique contributions to the development of gender-sensitive therapeutics. This new application will catalyze Yale's significant resources to support interdisciplinary and translational science in women's health to pursue extremely timely scientific findings that could represent a breakthrough in our understanding of treatments for a public health problem that affects millions daily. Our specific aims and objectives of the Yale-SCOR are to:    AIM 1: Evaluate the role of the noradrenergic system and its interactions with cholinergic and dopaminergic systems, in stress-induced smoking relapse and nicotine-based reinforcement, and use these findings to inform and expedite the development of gender-sensitive therapeutics for smoking cessation.    AIM 2: Mentor junior investigators in conducting interdisciplinary translational research on tobacco use and women's health through training opportunities, including ""clerkships"" with SCOR PIs, and pilot funding.    AIM 3: Be a national resource to invigorate and galvanize the study of sex and gender differences in relation to smoking by providing expert consultation; supporting faculty training awards; mining national data on gender, smoking and health outcomes to inform health policy; and expanding our current program of local and national community outreach.          Women compared to men, have poorer rates of smoking cessation and exacerbated health risks yet few attempts have been made to develop gender-sensitive smoking cessation treatments. This research will contribute to the public health by providing a neurobiologically-informed approach to the development of gender-sensitive therapeutics for smoking cessation, mentoring the next generation of interdisciplinary and translational researchers, and providing a national resource for women's health and tobacco use.            ",Yale SCOR on Gender-Sensitive Treatment for Tobacco Dependence,8712440,P50DA033945,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' California ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cities ', ' Consultations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Dyes ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' London ', ' Los Angeles ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Names ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Registries ', ' Reinforcement (Psychology) ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Benzeneacetamide, N-(aminoiminomethyl)-2,6-dichloro- ', ' Guanfacine ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' Agonist ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Smoker ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Consult ', ' Services ', ' Church ', ' cholinergic ', ' noradrenergic ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' human ESC ', ' human ES cell ', ' hESC ', ' human embryonic stem cell ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Province ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Last Name ', ' Smoking and Health ', ' Smoking and Health Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Instruction ', ' performance site ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' translational approach ', ' FDA approved ', ' smoking relapse ', ' Teacher Training ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Faculty Education ', ' teacher professional development ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,P50,2014,1344283,0.2871159896441585
"Implementing tobacco use treatment guidelines in dental public health clinics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. The 2008 Public Health Service Guideline (PHS), Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence provides strong evidence that brief advice combined with assistance such as counseling and pharmacotherapy, can significantly increase quit rates. Unfortunately, provider adherence to Guideline recommendations is poor. Inadequate implementation of the Guideline in practice settings, particularly those serving ethnic minorities and other vulnerable populations, has contributed to growing disparities in smoking prevalence and tobacco-related illness. This proposal addresses this research-to-practice gap by examining the effectiveness of three practical and highly replicable strategies for implementing evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of tobacco dependence in dental public health clinics. Dental providers have a credible and central role in providing tobacco cessation services. The majority of smokers see a dentist annually and tobacco use is a known risk factor for oral disease. Moreover, controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy and effectiveness of dental office-based cessation interventions. Yet dental care settings remain a relatively untapped venue for the treatment of tobacco dependence. In order to integrate evidence-based tobacco cessation treatment into routine dental practice, optimal implementation processes and strategies must be identified. We propose a 3-arm, cluster randomized controlled trial that will 1) Compare the effectiveness and cost of three promising strategies for implementation of the PHS tobacco use treatment guidelines: a) Staff training and current best practices (CBP); 2) CBP + provider performance feedback (PF) and 3) CBP + PF + provider reimbursement for delivery of tobacco cessation treatment (pay for performance) on provider adherence to recommended guidelines for tobacco use treatment; 2) Use a mixed-methods approach to examine potential theory-driven mechanisms at the organizational and provider level hypothesized to explain the comparative effectiveness of three strategies for implementation; and 3) Identify baseline organizational factors that influence the implementation of evidence-based tobacco use treatment practices in dental clinics. The trial will be conducted in 18 public dental care clinics and information about implementation outcomes and processes will be derived from multiple data sources (patient exit interviews, provider surveys and semi- structured interviews). Guided by a conceptual framework that emphasizes provider beliefs and organizational characteristics, we will identify factors that influence the implementation process in dental clinics. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to provide critical new knowledge to facilitate the widespread adoption, implementation, dissemination and sustained utilization of evidence-based tobacco use treatment strategies in dental practices across the U.S.         ",Implementing tobacco use treatment guidelines in dental public health clinics,8624668,R01CA162035,"['Adoption ', ' Belief ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Sources ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Clinics ', ' Dental Offices ', ' Dentists ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Feedback ', ' dental practice ', ' Dental General Practice ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoking ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Tobacco ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' United States ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' Reminder Systems ', ' Process Measure ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Structure ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' trial design ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' effectiveness research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' provider intervention ', ' research into practice ', ' research to practice ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' financial incentive ', ' brief advice ', ' arm ', ' ']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2014,895109,0.08077871866484744
"Web-based Smoking Cessation Program for Tribal College Students     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  American Indian tribal college students have the highest smoking rates of any racial/ethnic group in the young adult population and also are disproportionately burdened by smoking-related morbidity and mortality. There are very few effective culturally-tailored smoking cessation programs for AI smokers. Our research group has worked with the American Indian community for the past 8 years to develop a culturally-tailored smoking cessation program (All Nations Breath of Life - ANBL), for AI adult smokers. All Nations Breath of Life was developed using the community-based participatory research approach and is an in-person group based program that incorporates cultural issues throughout the program. We have produced 30% cessation rates at 6-month follow-up with adult American Indian smokers from tribes and nations in the Midwest. Due to limited studies with the tribal college population, we have already conducted a cross-sectional internet-based survey to collect information on their smoking behaviors as well as other health behaviors. This research experience and strong collaboration with the AI community leaves us well poised to adapt the ANBL program for the tribal college smoking population. However, this current program needs substantial modifications to meet the unique needs of the tribal college student population. It recognizes the sacred role of tobacco among many American Indians and how culture affects smoking cessation among AIs, while still addressing recreational smoking. However, preliminary data from our recent studies indicate that the internet may be more favorable and appropriate delivery method for reaching this younger and more mobile tribal college population due to the web interactivity, immediacy of feedback, and wide reach and accessibility. This current proposal reflects a natural progression to addressing the significant problem of smoking among tribal college students using our successful methods. In this study, we will adapt and test a culturally tailored internet-based smoking cessation (I-ANBL) program based on ANBL, which was developed through CBPR methods. For the current proposal, we will conduct an individual randomized controlled trial (N=242) to test the effectiveness of an internet-based culturally-tailored smoking cessation program (I-ANBL) in a tribal college student population. Data will be collected at baseline, 3 months and 6 months using salivary cotinine, as well as comprehensive set of environmental and psychosocial measures. We hypothesize that AI tribal college students randomized to the culturally-tailored smoking cessation internet arm (I-ANBL) will have significantly higher continuous abstinence rates at 6 months than those receiving the heart healthy diet intervention (I-FV), focusing on increasing fruit and vegetable consumption. We will also examine the costs of delivering the tailored intervention program and potential mediators and moderators of the intervention-cessation relationship. Such a high-reach, low-cost strategy for promoting smoking cessation in this at-risk and underserved population could have great potential for adoption on a larger scale and thus help reduce existing health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  American Indians (AI) have the highest rates of cigarette smoking of any major racial/ethnic group in the US, approaching 40% to 50%. Despite the overall decline in adult smoking prevalence during the past several decades, the young adult (18-29 year olds) age group has the highest prevalence of smoking. We will conduct a randomized trial to test the effectiveness of an internet-based culturally-tailored smoking cessation program among tribal college students.            ",Web-based Smoking Cessation Program for Tribal College Students,8637945,R01CA174481,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Alien ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Conceptions ', ' Scotine ', ' 2-Pyrrolidinone, 1-methyl-5-(3-pyridinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Cotinine ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Feedback ', ' Habits ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart ', ' Marketing ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Tribes ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' enhancing factor ', ' base ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Smoker ', ' Life ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' programs ', ' Salivary ', ' Healthy diet ', ' good diet ', ' Diet good ', ' psychosocial ', ' meetings ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' high school ', ' intervention program ', ' Cigarette ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' high school senior ', ' 12th grade ', ' twelfth grade ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Reporting ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' tribal university ', ' tribal college ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2014,558995,0.21361444884608607
"Motivating Smokers with Mobility Impairments to Quit Smoking  Abstract  People with physical disabilities experience similar health disparities as other disadvantaged groups (e.g., no insurance, decreased access to medical and preventive care, more co-morbidities) but significantly less attention is paid to their health promotion. While smoking cessation interventions have been developed for other disadvantaged groups, none exist for people with physical disabilities. People with physical disabilities (mobility impairments) who use assistance to ambulate have higher smoking rates (32.5%) than people who have a disability and do not need assistance (23%) and people who are not disabled (19.8%; Brawarsky et al. 2002). The aims of the current study are to: 1) develop a series of theory-based intervention DVDs focused on motivating smoking cessation among people with mobility impairments (i.e., chronically use some type of assistance to walk such as walker, cane, wheelchair, braces, etc) and 2) test the efficacy of the Intervention DVDs vs. Print-based Standard Care among 560 smokers with mobility impairments in a randomized trial. The materials in both groups will be mailed on a monthly basis for four months, and are organized in separate sections according to readiness to quit. Participants in both groups will receive a) nicotine patches at no cost if they are ready to quit and b) brief phone calls (~5 minutes) between mailings to assess and encourage viewing the materials. We hypothesize that smokers who are randomized to receive the Intervention DVDs will be significantly more likely to achieve 7-day and 30-day point-prevalence abstinence at 1, 6, and 12- month follow-ups vs. those who receive Print-based Standard Care. The Intervention DVDs will be based on Behavioral Activation Theory, and address specific barriers to quitting in this population (increased stress, decreased positive affect, increased depressed mood, activity restriction, and self-efficacy). We hypothesize that the intervention will impact these mediators directly, as well as indirectly through Behavioral Activation (goal setting and pleasant events). Our series of preliminary studies support the use of these mediators for people with mobility impairments and the use of DVDs as an acceptable mode of intervention, given the economic and mobility limitations of this population. If effective, our DVD intervention could have a high level of public health and clinical significance, as it could be easily disseminated at low cost through national disability-related organizations, networks of independent living centers, or physician offices, and substantially improve the health and quality of life for people with physical disabilities. This study is innovative because no studies have targeted this population, it applies Behavioral Activation Theory to smoking cessation, and it examines relatively novel mediators in the field of smoking (e.g., positive affect, behavioral activation).  Narrative No smoking cessation interventions exist that target smokers with mobility impairments, though 32.5% of this population smokes. The current study aims to develop theory-based Intervention DVD's for smoking cessation for people with mobility impairments and test its efficacy for increasing smoking cessation vs. print-based standard care in a randomized trial.",Motivating Smokers with Mobility Impairments to Quit Smoking,8676692,R01CA137616,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Braces ', ' Braces-Orthopedic appliances ', ' Walking Sticks ', ' Canes ', ' cane, includes canes of all materials, adjustable or fixed, with tip ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Independent Living ', ' Insurance ', ' literacy ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Mails ', ' Maintenance ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Motivation ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', "" Physicians' Offices "", ' Printing ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Target Populations ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Time ', ' Walkers ', ' mobile assistive system ', ' mobile assistive device ', ' mobile assistance system ', ' mobile assistance device ', ' Wheel Chairs ', ' Wheelchairs ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' disability ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Smoker ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' nicotine patch ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' self help ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' Abstinence ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' group intervention ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NCI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R01,2014,326733,0.23036027888124114
"Financial Incentives for Smoking Cessation Among Disadvantaged Pregnant Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking during pregnancy is the leading preventable cause of poor pregnancy outcomes in the U.S.  Most pregnant smokers continue smoking through pregnancy producing serious immediate and longer-term adverse health consequences for the infant.    Smoking during pregnancy is highly associated  with  economic  disadvantage and a substantive contributor to health disparities.     Efficacious  interventions  are  available  but  cessation  rates  are  low  (<20 percent)  and  improvements  in  birth  outcomes often modest or absent.  Current treatments usually entail relatively brief, low-cost interventions (e.g. pregnancy-specific quit lines).  There is broad consensus that more effective interventions are sorely needed.    We  have  developed  a  novel  behavioral-economic  intervention  in  which  women  earn  financial  incentives contingent on smoking abstinence.  In a meta-analysis of treatments for smoking during pregnancy, effect sizes achieved with financial incentives were several-fold larger than those achieved with lower-intensity approaches or medications.    The  intervention  also  appears  to  improve  birth  outcomes  and  increase  breastfeeding duration.  While highly promising, further research is needed in at least three areas.  (1) The evidence on birth outcomes and breastfeeding is from studies that combined data across trials rather than a single prospective trial, (2) whether the intervention produces other postpartum improvements in health has not been investigated, and (3) the overall cost-effectiveness of this approach has not been examined.    To  examine  these  unanswered  questions,  we  are  proposing  a  randomized,  controlled  clinical  trial  comparing  the  efficacy  and  cost  effectiveness  throuh  one-year  postpartum  of  current  best  practices  for  smoking-cessation  during  pregnancy  vs.  best  practices  plus  financial  incentives  among  230  pregnant,  Medicaid  recipients.   We  will  also  include  a  third  condition  of  115  pregnant  non-smokers  matched  to  the  smokers on socio-demographic and health conditions to compare the extent to which the treatments reduce  the burden of smoking and to estimate how much more might be accomplished by further improvements in this  incentives intervention without exceeding cost-effectiveness.  We hypothesize that best practices plus financial  incentives will be more effective than best practices alone, that the incentives intervention will be cost effective,  and  that  while  adding the  incentives  reduces  a  greater  proportion  of  the  health  and  economic  burden  of  smoking than best practices alone, more can be done while remaining cost effective.     Overall, the proposed study has the potential to substantially advance knowledge on cost-effective smoking cessation for pregnant women.    Importantly,  because  of  the  strong  association  between  smoking  during  pregnancy  and  economic  disadvantage,  the  proposed  study  also  has  the  potential  to  contribute  new  knowledge relevant to reducing the serious challenges of health disparities.              PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We  will  examine  whether  adding  financial  incentives  to  current  best  practices  for  smoking  cessation  during  pregnancy  (i.e.,  counseling  using  a  telephone  quit-line)  increases cessation rates and improves infant health.  While more expensive upfront,  this  treatment  approach  may  be  economically  justified  by  the  later  cost  savings  associated  with  more  women  quitting,  having  healthier  babies,  and  needing  less  healthcare.  It should also help to reduce the greater risk for health problems often seen among those who less well off economically.

"Project Impact: A Culturally-Tailored Adherence Intervention for Latino Smokers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2009, tobacco use was implicated in 438,000 deaths in the U.S. and over 80% of lung cancers were attributed to smoking. Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer death for Latino men and the second leading cause for Latina women. Several pharmacological treatments for smoking cessation have been shown to be effective at improving tobacco abstinence rates, including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Despite the availability of these efficacious treatments, adherence to treatment is a significant barrier for Latinos. Developing novel, effective and culturally targeted interventions that increase NRT adherence among Latinos can ultimately inform clinical practice and improve the cessation rates of Latino smokers seeking to quit. The current study seeks to develop and test a culturally tailored medication adherence intervention that will include text messaging and behavioral components that target the unique needs of Latino smokers. These novel and targeted components will address misperceptions and barriers related to NRT treatment and offer real-time reminders and informational prompts to enhance adherence. In the initial development phase of the research, qualitative methods will be used to develop the Latino-targeted components of the intervention. During the clinical trial phase of the study, 98 Latino smokers interested in quitting will be randomized to one of two groups - Culturally Tailored Adherence (CTA), or 2) Standard Medication Management (SMM). All participants will receive 12 weeks of NRT and will receive ongoing assessments of NRT adherence, tobacco abstinence, and will be assessed on the constructs of our theoretical model (e.g. motivation or behavioral skills). The proposed study will be conducted in the context of a five-year career development program that will provide advanced training in Latino smoking cessation and health, qualitative methods, adherence interventions, tobacco addiction and cessation, and the use of technology in healthcare. The proposed training and research plans aim to promote the applicant's long-term career goal of establishing an independently-funded program of tobacco research with a focus on Latino populations. A comprehensive training plan is proposed, combining mentored research, structured mentorship activities guided by established researchers in the field, formal coursework and workshops, and participation in seminars at Brown University and Butler Hospital.          Considering the high rates of non-adherence among Latino smokers involved in smoking cessation treatment, the proposed study addresses several public health concerns related to smoking cessation, cancer, and health disparities among Latinos. We seek to develop and test a culturally tailored intervention that aims to increase adherence to nicotine replacement therapy among Latino smokers. The results of the proposed study can have a beneficial effect on improving cessation rates among this vulnerable subpopulation and ultimately decrease the risks of developing tobacco-related diseases and illnesses.

"Culturally Targeted & Individually Tailored Smoking Cessation Study: LGBT Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goals are to increase smoking cessation in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) smokers and to understand the processes related to cessation and relapse in this underserved population. Conducted in two phases, the primary aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of a culturally targeted intervention versus a non-targeted intervention on smoking cessation outcomes in LGBT smokers. Further aims are to determine the effect of the ALA-CT intervention on individually mediated predictors of cessation and to explore the underlying cultural and psychosocial mechanisms through which the ALA-CT intervention has an impact (differential or not) on smoking cessation. In Phase I, we will use focus groups and a pilot trial to establish the cultural appropriateness and acceptability of the targeted elements of the intervention. In Phase 2, we will conduct a randomized smoking cessation trial to compare for the first time the efficacy of the American Lung Association's 'Freedom from Smoking Program' (ALA-FFS). Culturally targeted (ALA-CT) and Non-Targeted (Standard ALA-FFS) to LGBT smokers. The ALA-CT will consist of 7 culturally targeted (psychosocial and cultural) group counseling sessions combined with nicotine replacement and peer support. The contrast condition will be smokers who receive the non-targeted ALA-FFS program, nicotine replacement and peer support. The primary smoking cessation outcome will be point prevalence abstinence, i.e., no smoking, not even a puff, for previous 7 days, and will be assessed by Timeline Follow-Back derived measures for prolonged abstinence and point prevalence quit rates. Reported outcomes will be objectively verified [Carbon monoxide (CO) testing] at 1 month, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months follow-up to determine short and longer- term cessation outcomes. We will control for demographic variables that have known associations with smoking outcomes.

"Innovation for Smoke-Free Homes: Real-Time Feedback    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) is a significant health risk, especially to young children. More than 50 percent of children's SHSe occurs at home and children in low-income households are more likely to be exposed to SHS. Thus, home-based interventions are needed to protect children from SHSe. This is the first efficacy study to test whether children's home SHSe can be reduced by using innovative SHS particle monitors to provide real-time feedback to household residents plus brief advice/praise. This study will test the efficacy of immediate feedback and brief advice/praise on low-income families' ability to reduce children's exposure to nicotine, as measured by cotinine assays, reduce smoking in the home, and establish home smoking bans. Learning theory and pilot data suggest that real-time feedback from the monitor plus brief advice will prompt and reinforce SHSe reduction behaviors. Four hundred families from Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) programs in San Diego, California will be recruited. Households will be randomly assigned to an experimental group that receives continuous real-time feedback from a SHS particle monitor plus feedback-related brief advice/praise to reduce their child's exposure, or to a usual care control group where the particle monitor delivers no feedback. During the intervention phase, monitors in households of the experimental group will produce warning lights and beeps when SHS is detected. The primary specific aims are to: 1) Determine the differential group change in SHSe levels, as measured by child cotinine assays, due to real-time monitor feedback and brief advice; 2) Determine the differential group change in the establishment of home smoking bans; and 3) Validate differential change in particle measures of SHSe using nicotine dosimeters and child urine cotinine assays. The exploratory aims are to: determine theoretical moderators (e.g., child's health) of the effect of brief advice plus feedback; assess the effects of theoretical mediators (e.g., establishment of home smoking bans and other social contingencies) of change in SHSe; explore the dynamic nature of SHSe by examining the continuous particle monitor records over months to identify social contexts and micro- environments in the home as precise targets for intervention (e.g., smoking location, nonsmoker locations, and social interactions while smoking); assess the differential changes in tobacco use and SHSe by racial/ethnic group and by single v two-parent families to increase understanding of disparities for tobacco control; and obtain suggestions from families to enhance future use of the monitors. This is also the first large-scale test of a new technology in residential tobacco control, where real-time and telemetry feedback to investigators will both enable immediate feedback from light and sound alerts to families and inform investigators of smoking events or reduction in smoking events that warrant advice or praise. Thus, this application opens a new direction for future innovative studies using novel technology to advance reduction of SHSe in a range of micro-environments.        Secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) is a significant health hazard for adults and children, especially the medically vulnerable. There is no risk-free level of SHSe and cumulative exposure can lead to pulmonary diseases and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Millions of U.S. children are exposed at home. This is the first study to test an innovative particle monitor to provide real-time feedback (lights/sounds) to encourage parents to reduce young children's SHSe in their home.

"A mobile intervention to promote cessation in HIV-infected smokers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are nearly one million persons living with confirmed HIV infection (PLWH) in the US, 60% of them smoke cigarettes, and 75% of them are interested in quitting. Almost none are currently accessing smoking cessation interventions designed to meet their specific needs and concerns.  Cigarette smoking is a leading contributor to mortality among PLWH in the HAART era, and it is the direct cause of 30% of non-AIDS defining malignancies. It is driving the alarming rise in cardiac events and lung cancers in this highly vulnerable population. The lack of access to proven, effective, culturally appropriate tobacco cessation services represents a health disparity of the first order. The psychosocial profile of the PLWH-smoker community, characterized by high rates of psychiatric comorbidity, drug and alcohol use, and low levels of social support, suggests that achieving high cessation rates will be a great challenge.  Positively Smoke Free is an intensive, multisession, cessation intervention specifically developed for PLWH smokers. It is currently available as a live, group therapy program and also as a web-based version designed for notebook or desktop computers. In its current form, the web-version is not adoptable to the smartphone platform. Pilot data from randomized, controlled, trials of both formats show promise.  The number of individuals in the US who own smartphones and who use them to access health information on the internet is steadily growing. This growth is most pronounced in the ethnic minority groups that make up the majority of the PLWH community in the US. Behavioral interventions delivered via smartphones offer the advantage of expansive reach, low cost, and immediacy of access to users. A burgeoning body of literature suggests that this may be an especially effective tool for tobacco treatment. mHealth tobacco treatment interventions for PLWH smokers have not yet been explored.  This proposal aims (1) to adapt Positively Smoke Free to the mobile format for smartphones (2) to test the feasibility (i.e. recruitment, adherence, retention, satisfaction, and cost) of mobile Positively Smoke Free (mPSF) in a cohort of 50 PLWH smokers, (3) to complete a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing biochemically confirmed 3-month abstinence rates in subjects (N=50) assigned to the mPSF condition versus those (N=50) assigned to standard care (all subjects will be offered a 3-month supply of nicotine replacement therapy) and (4) to conduct exploratory analyses of putative moderators and mediators of program efficacy.  If the mobile version of PSF is proven to be feasible and efficacious, the project will have short term impact by opening a new vista of tobacco (and other behavioral) treatment for a highly vulnerable group. Study data will provide crucial information for a definitive trial of the intervention. The long-term impact will be reduced tobacco-related morbidity and mortality among PLWH, and a clearer understanding of the role of mHealth in comprehensive HIV care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic of cigarette smoking is fueling an alarming rise in cardiovascular disease and tobacco-related cancers in persons living with HIV. Smokers living with HIV have few, if any, cessation resources available to them that address their particular needs, and HIV care providers have virtually no evidence-base to guide their approach to tobacco treatment. The proposal, if funded, will attempt to address this major public health issue by using mobile-web and smartphone technology to expand the reach of a promising, tailored cessation intervention.                ",A mobile intervention to promote cessation in HIV-infected smokers,8656257,R34DA037042,"['etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Computers ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Literature ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Marketing ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Advancing Tobacco Use Treatment for African American Smokers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With a 50% greater relative-risk of smoking attributed lung cancer than Whites, and the highest overall rates of cancer incidence and mortality in the U.S., African Americans experience disproportionately greater tobacco- related disease burden. Striking health disparities exist despite the fact that African Americans have similar smoking prevalence as Whites, yet smoke fewer cigarettes per day (cpd). In fact, over half of all African American smokers are light smokers (smoke 10 or fewer cpd). To have an impact on the premature mortality of African American smokers, effective treatment for smokers across the smoking continuum must be identified. Varenicline, the leading first-line medication for tobacco use treatment, triples the likelihood of long-term abstinence relative to placebo in those smoking >10 cpd. To date, efficacy of varenicline has not been established in African American smokers or light smokers. The long-term goal of this research is to advance treatment for all African American smokers in order to reduce tobacco-related disease and death. Our primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of varenicline for tobacco use treatment among 500 African American smokers, including a full range of cpd, within a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. We will randomize participants in a 3:2 ratio to receive varenicline (1 mg bid; n=300) or placebo (n=200) for 12 weeks, along with individualized health education counseling for all participants. Our specific aims are to evaluate the efficacy of varenicline to promote abstinence in African American smokers across the continuum of smoking level, to examine efficacy in light smokers and also in moderate to heavy smokers, to characterize nicotine and carcinogen exposure, and to describe biopsychosocial characteristics of this group and evaluate in relation to abstinence. This innovative study will provide the first placebo-controlled evaluatin of varenicline in the full spectrum of African American smokers, and the first to examine varenicline in light smokers. Findings will contribute to advancing effective treatment for African American smokers and for light smokers, and enhancing individualized treatment. Increased treatment efficacy will have major impact on reducing tobacco- related morbidity and mortality in this high-risk population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans experience the highest levels of tobacco-related disease and death, despite smoking fewer cigarettes per day than Whites. Advancing treatment for African American smokers is a critical public health priority. This study will evaluate the efficacy of varenicline treatment to improve quit rates in African American daily smokers of all smoking levels, with the goal of reducing tobacco-related health disparities.             ",Advancing Tobacco Use Treatment for African American Smokers,8694609,R01DA035796,"['neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Scotine ', ' 2-Pyrrolidinone, 1-methyl-5-(3-pyridinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Cotinine ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Goals ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Incidence ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Cyclohexanol, 5-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)- ', ' Menthol ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Placebos ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Tobacco ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' buproprion ', ' Amfebutamone ', ' Bupropion ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' improved ', ' Biochemical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Evaluation ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' Cigarette ', ' Participant ', ' Treatment Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Intake ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Characteristics ', ' varenicline ', ' Placebo Control ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Carcinogen exposure ', ' Abstinence ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' FDA approved ', ' primary outcome ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' public health priorities ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2014,666742,0.19890704333353695
"A Family-Focused Intervention for Asian American Male Smokers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Family-Focused Intervention for Asian American Male Smokers Smoking prevalence remains high in subgroups of Asian American men, particularly among those with low English proficiency (LEP) and immigrants from cultures where smoking prevalence is high, including Chinese and Vietnamese. The 2011-12 California Health Interview Survey estimates that nearly half (46%) of all Asian male smokers in California are either Chinese or Vietnamese. The smoking prevalence's among LEP Chinese and Vietnamese men were 32% and 43%, respectively, compared to 16% of the general California male population. We developed a family-focused intervention utilizing lay health worker (LWH) outreach that integrates formative qualitative research and selected constructs from Social Network Theory, Social Cognitive Theory, and the Trans-theoretical Model. The intervention involves 2 small group education sessions with dyads of smokers and family members, and 2 follow-up individual telephone calls delivered by LHWs over 2 months. Our single-group pilot trial with 96 dyads of Chinese and Vietnamese male daily smokers and their family members showed a high feasibility of recruiting unmotivated smokers (42% were at ""precontemplation""), and a promising 7-day point prevalence abstinence rate of 30% at 3 months with independent corroboration from family members. The first aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the family-focused intervention in promoting smoking cessation in Chinese and Vietnamese male smokers. The second aim is to explore mediators to identify key psychosocial and behavioral processes that underlie how the intervention affects the processes of quitting and maintaining abstinence. We will conduct a 2-arm cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with assessments at baseline, 6 and 12 months following intervention initiation. The RCT involves 60 lay health workers (LHWs); each recruits and delivers interventions to 6 dyads of one male daily smoker and one family member from his household, for a total 360 smoker-family dyads. Half of the LHWs, stratified by Asian subgroup and smoking history, will be randomized to the family-focused intervention group and the other half will be assigned to an attention control condition receiving education on healthy eating. All participants will receive written information on smoking cessation resources. We hypothesize that, at 6 and 12 month follow-up, the intervention smokers will be more likely to achieve biochemically verified smoking abstinence (7-day point prevalence), to report having made at least one 24-hour quit attempt, and to report using at least one evidence-based smoking cessation resource (quitline, medication, health professional advice) than smokers in the control condition. Using prospective quantitative data obtained from the RCT, and post-trial dyadic and individual interviews of 30 smokers and 30 family members selected based on abstinence experiences, we will explore mediators at individual, family and social network levels that explain how the intervention affects quitting and maintaining abstinence. The long-term goal is to understand effective ways to utilize family-based and social outreach strategies to reduce tobacco use disparities in hard-to-reach populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will examine the use of an innovative strategy that involves lay health worker outreach to mobilize smokers and their families to promote smoking cessation in Chinese and Vietnamese American men. This project will yield a significant public health impact as it addresses gaps in knowledge about effective strategies for treating tobacco dependence in underrepresented populations where smoking prevalence is disproportionately high such as among Chinese and Vietnamese American men.            ",A Family-Focused Intervention for Asian American Male Smokers,8761475,R01DA036749,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Attention ', ' California ', ' Chinese American ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Household and Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Household ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Smoking ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' Writing ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Family member ', ' Social Network ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Immigrant ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Smoking History ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' post intervention ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' pilot trial ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' Network-based ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' FDA approved ', ' group intervention ', ' population based ', ' arm ', ' ']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2014,672850,0.20319047704545187
"Self-Affirmation and Responses to Smoking Risk Messages among African Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching purpose of the proposed research is to harness new developments in psychological and communication sciences to address a key obstacle in communication-based smoking cessation efforts - the tendency for smokers to react defensively toward smoking risk information - and apply relevant knowledge to the promotion of smoking cessation among African American smokers. The proposed project seeks to evaluate an innovative approach based on self-affirmation theory to suppressing smokers' defensive processing of smoking risk information in a laboratory-based randomized trial involving African American smokers. Specifically, this project aims to 1) determine whether self-affirmation (vs. no self-affirmation) reduces defensive responses toward graphic cigarette warning labels; 2) ascertain whether self-affirmation (vs. no self- affirmation) leads to more negative explicit and implicit attitudes toward smoking, greater intentions to quit, and reduced cigarette consumption following exposure to graphic cigarette warning labels; and 3) investigate whether smoking identity moderates the effects of self-affirmation. The proposed project addresses a major public health concern as well as significant tobacco-related health disparities. This study will advance scientific knowledge on self-affirmation as a mechanism for reducing smokers' defensive processing of smoking risk messages. The findings will be directly relevant to the translation of the basic behavioral science underlying smoking risk communication into enhanced smoking cessation approaches. If self-affirmation functions as expected in the proposed randomized trial, a self-affirmation task can be easily implemented in communication-based smoking cessation interventions to enhance the outcomes. The proposed study will also provide direct evidence relevant to the ongoing public health debate concerning the effectiveness of graphic warning labels as a means of communicating smoking risks in the United States.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project addresses a major public health concern - tobacco control - as well as significant tobacco-related health disparities.

"Contingency Management for Smoking Cessation in Pregnant Minority Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to reduce tobacco-related disparities in maternal and infant health outcomes by improving smoking cessation and relapse prevention interventions for minority pregnant and postpartum women, who have been significantly underrepresented in smoking cessation research. This study will examine the feasibility and efficacy of a prize-based contingency management approach for increasing smoking cessation and preventing relapse among socioeconomically disadvantaged minority pregnant smokers. First, the intervention will be pretested with 10 pregnant low-income minority smokers and then refined based on acceptability survey and focus group data. Next, a pilot study will be conducted. 60 highly disadvantaged minority women, recruited from the outpatient obstetric clinics at a large teaching hospital, who report daily smoking and who meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., 18 years or older; < 28 weeks gestational age) will be enrolled ad randomized to one of two study conditions: 1) Standard Psychoeducational Intervention (6- week, individually-administered, pregnancy-specific Quit Smoking Now curriculum, as currently implemented in the clinic; QSN-SP); 2) Standard Psychoeducational Intervention plus Contingency Management (provision of incentives contingent on biochemically-verified abstinence; QSN-CM). Abstinence monitoring via expired carbon monoxide and salivary continues levels will occur in both groups beginning on the first quit day and continuing through 3-months postpartum. Only participants in the QSN-CM group will be reinforced for biochemically-verified abstinence with chances to win prizes ranging in value from approximately $1 to $100 ('fishbowl' or 'prize bowl' method). Primary study outcomes include: intervention attendance and completion; and continuous, prolonged and point prevalence tobacco abstinence (self-report with biochemical verification). Secondary outcomes include: maternal and infant health outcomes (e.g., gestational age; infant birth weight, length and head circumference; delivery/neonatal complications; infant growth and respiratory health). The study will also examine factors (e.g., depression, stress) influencing treatment response. Outcomes will be assessed through follow-up research exams (delivery and 6-months postpartum) and hospital chart reviews. Results should advance scientific knowledge regarding effective methods for promoting and maintaining smoking abstinence among pregnant disadvantaged women and provide preliminary feasibility and efficacy data needed to support a larger randomized controlled trial.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prenatal smoking has been associated with numerous adverse pregnancy and delivery complications. Socioeconomically disadvantaged, minority women are less likely to quit smoking, are more likely to relapse after cessation and may suffer greater health consequences, for themselves and their baby, as a result of smoking. The proposed project seeks to reduce disparities in tobacco-related maternal and infant health outcomes by improving smoking cessation and relapse prevention interventions for low-income, minority pregnant and postpartum women.

"Understanding Disparities in Quitting in African American and White Smokers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial/ethnic differences in smoking are well documented; African Americans smoke fewer cigarettes per day than Whites but experience disproportionately greater smoking attributable morbidity and mortality. Well documented disparities also exist in smoking cessation with African Americans consistently quitting at lower rates than Whites. However, to-date, no adequately powered study, stratified on race, has been conducted to confirm this finding using a rigorous study design or to understand the mechanisms accounting for differential quit rates in African Americans relative to Whites. The objectives of this application are to 1) describe the differences in smoking cessation among AA and White smokers treated with varenicline, 2) identify the smoking, psychosocial, treatment process, and biological factors that independently explain the relationship between race/ethnicity and cotinine-verified 7-day abstinence in African American and White smokers, and 3) examine the side effect profile of varenicline by smoking level. These aims will be accomplished through a prospective cohort intervention study, stratified on race, age (< 40, > 40), and gender among 448 participants (224 African American, 224 White). All participants will receive 3 months of varenicline, the most effective of currently available smoking cessation medications, standard educational materials, and six sessions of smoking cessation counseling. This study is innovative. It will be the first known study to report on the use of varenicline in As, the first to examine varenicline in light smokers (<10 cpd) and among a wide range of smoking levels (3-20 cpd), the first head-to-head study, stratified on race, designed to prospectively compare pharmacotherapy in AAs versus Whites, and one of a few to explore mechanisms underlying disparities in quitting between AA and White smokers. The impact of these findings will be considerable, having ramifications for treatment, clinical practice, and policy. Significan knowledge will be gained about African American-White differences in quitting. Findings have the potential to improve tobacco use treatment by moving the field away from a generic focus on race/ethnicity toward a targeted focus on modifiable smoking, psychosocial, and treatment process factors most relevant to African Americans and to Whites.          African Americans smoking fewer cigarettes per day and experience greater smoking-related disease and death, yet consistently quit smoking at lower rates than Whites. Little is known about the reasons for this disparity. This study will examine mechanisms explaining lower quit rates in African Americans relative to Whites and has the potential to significantly improve tobacco use treatment outcomes by identifying specific barriers and facilitators to quitting smoking for African Americans and for Whites.

"Sex Differences in the Mechanisms that Promote Nicotine Reward and Withdrawal     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use remains a major public health and economic concern, particularly in women who are more vulnerable to the long-term health consequences of smoking than men. Despite the magnitude of the problem, there is a fundamental knowledge gap in our understanding of the mechanisms that promote tobacco use in females. If this knowledge gap is not filled, then reducing tobacco use and developing specialized medications for female smokers will remain largely incomprehensible. The long-term goal of our research program is to identify the mechanisms that mediate tobacco use among different clinical populations that are uniquely susceptible to this problem. The objective of this renewal is to determine the neural mechanisms that promote tobacco use in females. The central hypothesis is that females are more susceptible to tobacco use than males because of stronger rewarding effects of nicotine and heightened anxiety produced by withdrawal from this drug. Our mechanistic hypothesis is that estradiol (E2) promotes the rewarding effects of nicotine and magnifies the stress produced by nicotine withdrawal in females. More specifically, we postulate that sex differences in response to nicotine are modulated within the neural circuits of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), where dopamine is increased following nicotine administration and decreased during withdrawal from this drug. Thus, females experience greater rewarding effects of nicotine in the presence of E2, which promotes dopamine release in the NAcc. Following repeated nicotine exposure, opponent processes develop to counteract the chronic over-activation of dopamine release. We suggest that the emergence of these opponent processes is evident during withdrawal from chronic nicotine as an increase in the stress hormone, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in the NAcc. This increase in CRF levels enhances the inhibitory tone in the NAcc, which results in a decrease in dopamine release during nicotine withdrawal. Thus, females experience greater anxiety during nicotine withdrawal in the presence of E2, which promotes the recruitment of opponent stress systems that suppress dopamine release in the NAcc. The proposed studies reflect a multi- disciplinary approach involving neurochemical, behavioral, and gene transfer techniques to compare sex differences in the rewarding effects of nicotine (Aim 1) and the aversive states produced by withdrawal (Aim 2) because both of these factors are believed to promote tobacco use in females. The approach to studying sex differences involves comparisons of male, female, and OVX female rats. If the removal of ovarian hormones reverses the proposed measures in females, then the role of E2 will be assessed in OVX rats that will receive E2 supplementation and will be tested following E2 or vehicle administration. At the completion of this project, our findings will help us develop a unifying hypothesis regarding the factors that promote tobacco use in females. This exemplifies the significance of this research because a better understanding of the mechanisms that fuel tobacco use in females will lead to more effective treatments to reduce health disparities in women.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because our findings will be an important step toward elucidating the neural substrates that promote addiction pathology in women. Thus, our studies are relevant to the mission of NIH to support research aimed at reducing the burden of tobacco abuse, especially in women who are most vulnerable to the long-term effects of tobacco use.            ",Sex Differences in the Mechanisms that Promote Nicotine Reward and Withdrawal,8728374,R01DA021274,"['Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' corticotropin releasing hormone ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticoliberin ', ' CRF-41 ', ' ACTH-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' 4-(2-Aminoethyl)-1,2-benzenediol ', ' 3,4-Dihydroxyphenethylamine ', ' Dopamine ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17-diol (17beta)- ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estradiol ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hormones ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mission ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neurochemical ', ' neurochemistry ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Nicotine Withdrawal ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Self Administration ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' drug withdrawal ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Microdialysis ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' tobacco abuse ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dependence ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' novel ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' Ovarian hormone ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' response ', ' Transgenesis ', ' Gene Transfer Techniques ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Supplementation ', ' transfer of a gene ', ' Gene Transfer ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' health economics ', ' Population ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Affective ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO,R01,2014,403895,0.09801115594627277
"DISC:  Describe Smoking Cessation in RCT Multi-Component Behavioral Intervention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Behavioral interventions are commonly used to promote smoking cessation. They typically have multiple components and are implemented over time. Smokers' engagement and response behaviors change over the course of interventions, resulting in substantial individual variations in outcomes. However, methods are underdeveloped for characterizing smokers' complex behaviors in longitudinal multi-component interventions. Internet-based and face-to-face culturally-tailored interventions are two promising, but relatively unexplored, behavioral interventions. The first is cost effective for reaching generl smoking populations, yet we know little about how to adequately measure individuals' dynamic online engagement with an intervention or examine its efficacy. The second targets specific populations, but we need to learn how racial/ethnic groups respond to such interventions and how much cultural tailoring is useful. We propose a new pattern-recognition approach to characterize complex engagement/response behaviors during Internet-based and culturally tailored interventions. Our approach is built on the PI's preliminary smoking behavior studies, for which she developed a multiple-imputation-based fuzzy clustering model (MI-Fuzzy) to identify pregnancy smoking behavioral patterns, and to cope with real-world situations where smokers have memberships in multiple clusters and their smoking data are longitudinal, non-normal, high dimensional and contain many missing values. Herein, we will enhance MI-Fuzzy with new features, compare it to typical models, and expand our pattern approach to two longitudinal behavioral intervention studies: (1) Dr. Houston's large-scale NCI-funded, Quit-Primo Internet intervention for a general smoking population, and (2) Dr. Kim's small-scale NIDA-funded cognitive, culturally tailored, clinic-based TDTA intervention for a minority smoking population. We will characterize smokers' online engagement (Quit-Primo) and cognitive responses (TDTA), evaluate how the interventions' components work for different smokers, clarify their efficacy, and provide a new, detailed understanding of how smokers' trajectory patterns relate to different cessation outcomes. Better understanding of how smokers engage with and respond to interventions will help uncover important relationships missed by traditional approaches, yield new evidence on how to improve these interventions for targeted populations and on high-risk behavioral patterns that may be clinically important for early intervention. Examining different types of behavioral interventions will also facilitate generalizing our pattern approach to other substance-use studies and populations. By providing analytical prototypes and accessible tools, this study will advance general pattern recognition methodology, and accelerate its utility in behavioral studies of substance use. As our dissemination activities expand, this work will likely stimulate similar studies for better and targeted interventions, ultimately benefiting patient-centered care related to substance use.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Behavioral interventions are commonly used to help people quit smoking, among which Internet-based and culturally tailored interventions are promising but relatively unexplored formats. Even when interventions are delivered uniformly, smokers engage with and respond to them differently. Our innovative pattern-recognition approach, MI-Fuzzy, will help characterize smokers' complex engagement and response behaviors during interventions, evaluate how intervention components work for different types of smokers, clarify the efficacy of each intervention, and provide a new, detailed understanding of how smokers' distinct behavioral patterns are associated with cessation outcomes. Better insight on smokers' engagement and responses during interventions will help improve these interventions for targeted populations and learn about high-risk behavioral patterns that may be clinically important for early intervention. By testing MI-Fuzzy in two funded studies (one Internet-based and one culturally tailored) and providing accessible software tools, our study will accelerate behavioral research on substance use, thereby benefiting large numbers of patients with substance use issues.            ",DISC:  Describe Smoking Cessation in RCT Multi-Component Behavioral Intervention,8699178,R01DA033323,"['Asian Americans ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Smoking ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Funding ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Simulate ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' behavior change ', ' Korean American ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' Population Study ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Cognitive ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Characteristics ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' microsystems ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' demographics ', ' implementation science ', ' smoking intervention ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2014,233445,0.1661892452701728
"Effectiveness of Proactive Tobacco Treatment in Diverse Low Income Smokers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a high prevalence of smoking and high burden of tobacco related disease among low income populations. Effective, evidenced-based smoking cessation treatments are available, but low-income and minority smokers are less likely than higher-income and white smokers to use these treatments, especially the most comprehensive forms that include a combination of pharmacotherapy and intensive behavioral counseling. In this application, we test a novel proactive outreach strategy, coupled with free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to increase the population impact of tobacco cessation treatment for diverse, low income smokers. Population impact is the product of treatment utilization (i.e., reach or exposure) and treatment efficacy (i.e., smoking abstinence rates among those who utilize treatment); therefore, the theory- driven approach will systematically offer low income smokers free and easy access to evidence-based treatment for tobacco dependence outside the traditional health care system. The intervention has two primary components: 1) proactive outreach to current smokers in the form of mailed invitation materials and telephone calls containing targeted health messages, and 2) facilitated access to free, comprehensive, evidence-based treatment for tobacco dependence in the form of NRT and intensive, telephone-based behavioral counseling. Our specific aims are to: 1) compare the effect of proactive outreach combined with free NRT and telephone counseling (PRO+NRT+TC) to usual care (UC) on population-level smoking abstinence rates among a diverse population of low income smokers, 2) compare the effect of PRO+NRT+TC to usual care UC on population-level tobacco treatment utilization rates, and 3) determine the cost-effectiveness of PRO+NRT+TC. This proposal will examine the effects of the intervention in a population-based sample (N=2500) of adult smokers enrolled in the Minnesota Health Care Programs (MHCP), a state-funded health insurance plan for low income persons. Baseline data will be obtained from MHCP administrative databases and a participant survey that will be conducted prior to randomization. Outcome data will be collected from a follow-up survey conducted 12 months after randomization and MHCP administrative data. The primary outcome is prolonged smoking abstinence (6 months) and will be assessed at the population level. All randomized individuals will be asked to complete the follow-up survey, regardless of whether they participated in tobacco treatment. Data analysis of the primary aims will follow intent-to-treat methodology. The study team has unique, relevant experience with tobacco treatment studies in diverse, low income populations, proactive outreach and telephone counseling. We will work in partnership with the North American Quitline Consortium to disseminate study findings. If effective, proactive tobacco treatment would reduce tobacco- related morbidity, mortality and health care costs for low income Americans.         There is a high prevalence of smoking and high burden of tobacco related disease among low income populations. There is a critical need to increase access to effective tobacco dependence treatments. We propose to rigorously evaluate the effects of proactive outreach coupled with free NRT and telephone counseling on the population impact of tobacco dependence treatment. If proven to be effective and cost- effective, national dissemination of proactive treatment approaches would reduce tobacco-related morbidity, mortality, and health care costs for low income Americans.

"Developing a Culturally Relevant Model of Smoking Cessation among Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Yessenia Castro, Ph.D., is a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Health Disparities Research at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). She is seeking five years of funding through the National Cancer Institute's Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to Promote Diversity (K01). Dr. Castro conducts research examining social, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and cultural determinants of smoking cessation in minority and underserved populations under the mentorship of Dr. David Wetter. MDACC provides an unusually rich training environment that includes an extraordinary number of workshops, seminars, and courses; outstanding opportunities for developing skills in grant writing, publication, and project management; and superb resources for assisting young investigators.     Dr. Castro's long term career goals are to serve as an independent, research-oriented faculty member in a university environment, and to develop a program of research focused on understanding culturally relevant influences of cancer risk behaviors, with a particular focus on smoking among Latinos. Such a program could improve smoking cessation interventions tailored for or targeted at Latinos, and ultimately aid in eliminating health disparities among this population.     In the current proposal, Dr. Castro delineates four short term goals to be achieved throughout the award period that are intended to serve as the foundation for an independent research career. These are: 1) accumulate a strong knowledge base in the social, cognitive, and affective mechanisms and processes involved in tobacco dependence and cessation among underserved adult populations; 2)extend her current knowledge of research on gender and race/ethnicity into the area of cancer prevention; particularly, smoking cessation among Latinos; 3) gain knowledge and experience in culturally competent community level research from a public health perspective, and; 4) learn the appropriate statistical methods and modeling techniques for evaluating complex longitudinal data. These goals will be achieved through a combination of: 1) rigorous formal coursework and directed readings; 2) numerous professional development experiences; 3) numerous project implementation, data analysis, and manuscript writing/publication experiences, and; 4) intensive mentoring by a team of highly successful scientists with diverse expertise, such that each mentor can provide invaluable guidance in achieving a specific short term goal, but most can advise about more than one goal.     The proposed research plan seeks to address the paucity of existing research addressing the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation among Latinos. Research in addictions and health behavior has identified a number of individual-level factors that are key determinants of smoking cessation including social/environmental, inter-/intrapersonal, and cognitive/affective factors. Emerging research suggests that many of the known determinants of smoking cessation may be of equal importance to minority smokers, but more research is needed in this area, as noted by several prominent publications including the Surgeon General's Report and the Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence Clinical Practice Guideline. Further, with the exception of data addressing the influence of acculturation on smoking prevalence, almost nothing is known about the effect of acculturation and other culturally relevant variables (e.g., acculturative stress, perceived discrimination) on the process of smoking cessation. Thus, the proposed project will utilize data from three longitudinal studies of Latino smokers to examine the impact of culturally relevant factors on mechanisms of smoking cessation. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a comprehensive conceptual model linking cultural factors to mechanisms of smoking cessation that is informed by previous work addressing the impact of culture on mental and physical health, socioeconomic status influences on health, and theories of addictive behaviors. Additionally, the project will evaluate specific, fine-grained hypotheses using data collected with state-of-the-science ecological momentary assessment techniques.        Although Latinos are less likely to smoke, they exhibit more difficulty quitting, are less likely to seek or receive help with quitting, and are at high risk of developing tobacco related chronic illnesses. Further, very little is known about the determinants of smoking cessation among Latinos, or how factors specific to minority status influence determinants of cessation. Advancing knowledge in these areas would help to identify treatment targets, improve current smoking cessation interventions, and ultimately aid in eliminating health disparities among Latinos.

"Smoking Cessation Interventions and Program Availability for Drug and Alcohol Add    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of smoking among individuals seeking treatment for a co-occurring substance abuse condition is very high, between 70%-95% (Burling & Ziff, 1988; Fiore et al., 2000; Kozlowski et al., 1986; McCarthy et al., 2002). However, many drug treatment facilities do not encourage smoking cessation during treatment, even though patients are often show interest in quitting smoking. Research finds that not only are low income people more likely to smoke, but the resources for smoking cessation may not be as accessible as those who have higher income (Novotny & Giovino, 1998; MMRW, November 9, 2007; Barbeau et al., 2004; Honjo et al., 2006). Therefore, substance abuse treatment is a context where evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for smoking might have the best chance of reaching low-income smokers. Treating patient smoking concurrent with other drugs is important since research demonstrates that addiction to nicotine may cause changes in brain chemistry and structure which could trigger drug and alcohol cravings, decreasing the chance of prolonged sobriety (Britt & McGehee, 2008; Yeh et al., 2007). The proposed project pursues two objectives related to understanding the adoption, implementation, and sustainability (or conversely discontinuation) of EBTs for smoking in substance abuse treatment contexts. The first aim examines longitudinally the availability of EBTs for smoking among those seeking treatment for co-occurring substance abuse and explores the predictors of changes in service availability over time in treatment programs. Key categories of predictors include the percentage of low-income clients served by the treatment center, organizational and policy factors, and workforce characteristics. The second aim also uses a longitudinal design to examine the evidence-based clinical practice behaviors that counselors engage in with clients. This is important because individuals implement EBTs not organizations or treatment programs (Fixsen et al., 1995). Integrating theory and research from implementation science, public health, organizational change, substance abuse treatment, and health services delivery four categories of moderator variables are examined to understand why and under what conditions counselors are likely to engage clients in smoking cessation efforts with clients.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health-related risks of smoking make it a major public health concern, particularly in light of recent research suggesting that the addictive properties of nicotine are similar to that of opiates. There are also health disparities in both smoking behavior and smoking treatment as a function of socio-economic status and race/ethnicity. Many low-income people also lack access to high quality medical care (Warnecke et al., 2008) and are over-represented in substance abuse treatment contexts. By focusing on the availability, implementation, and sustainability of evidence-based treatments for smoking in the context of substance abuse treatment the proposed application has clear public health (including public health policy) relevance.

"Latinos Kick Buts: Mobile Engagement and Cessation Support for Latino Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos Kick Buts: Mobile Engagement and Cessation Support for Latino Smokers Latinos are less likely than non-Hispanic whites to have access to health, to have knowledge of existing smoking cessation resources, to receive advice to stop smoking, and to participate in smoking cessation programs. Mobile technologies can dramatically enhance the reach of effective smoking cessation interventions. However, the reach of mobile interventions among Latinos remains minimal despite the fact that Latinos utilize smartphone at a higher rate. An effective, feasible model for reaching and treating Latino smokers through mobile technologies has the potential for immediate widespread adoption. The objective of this proposal is to adapt the Kick Buts messaging and web content to be culturally relevant and linguistically appropriate to improve access to and utilization of smoking cessation resources among Latinos. This new version will also be expanded to engage and promote a dialogue among Latino smokers, regardless of their readiness to quit, aimed at creating a culture of quitting and thus affecting a measurable increase in quit attempts as well as the utilization of cessation resources. Automated and interactive text messaging will be used in combination with web-based content accessible via text-embedded links to cost effectively build and reinforce key behavioral skills and to: 1) implement a personal, culturally-relevant quit plan, 2) facilitate access to ordering nicotine replacement therapy as needed directly via mobile phone; 3) automatically link smokers to online social support, and 4) coordinate the critical follow-up that smokers need after a cessation attempt. All participants will complete follow-up assessment at the end of treatment (Week 12). Aim #1: Build the foundation to support future large-scale evaluations of Latinos Kick Buts. Aim # 2: Identify the perceived efficacy and relevance of various different types of text messages for Latinos. This project will lead to the development of an evidence-based, cost efficient and commercially viable text-messaging program designed for and broadly accessible to Latino smokers. This Phase I project will directly lead to a Phase II randomized trial that will determine the overall impact of this culturaly tailored mobile intervention. Based on the success of our existing Kick Buts program across multiple market segments, we believe Latinos Kick Buts could generate substantial interest among private and public sponsors and providers of health and wellness programs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Latinos are the largest and fastest growing population in the U.S., and tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease and death among U.S. Latinos. Although enhancing tobacco use treatment for this at-risk, underserved group is a critical public health priority, little is known about effectively treating Latino smokers. This innovative study will directly evaluate a culturally-enhanced technology- driven, smoking cessation intervention for Latino smokers, with the long-term goal of reducing tobacco- related health disparities, disease and death among Latinos.            ",Latinos Kick Buts: Mobile Engagement and Cessation Support for Latino Smokers,8998196,R41MD010318,"['Improve Access ', ' Measurable ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' STTR ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' cost efficient ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' public health priorities ', ' randomized trial ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Insurers ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Kansas ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maintenance ', ' Marketing ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Relapse ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoking ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Solutions ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Wellness Program ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Outcomes Assessment ', ' Outcome Assessment (Health Care) ', ' Businesses ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Schedule ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Staging ', ' Smoker ', ' English Language ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' success ', ' Employee ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Modeling ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' ']",NIMHD,"AGILE HEALTH, INC.",R41,2015,149688,0.050404367269148945
"Small Financial Incentives to Promote Smoking Cessation in Safety Net Hospital Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. Although the prevalence of smoking has declined to 18.1 percent among U.S. adults, 27.9 percent of those living in poverty report current smoking. Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking cessation. There is mounting evidence that offering incentives for abstinence (i.e., Contingency Management [CM]) may be an effective approach for promoting short-term smoking cessation, though few studies have demonstrated longer-term effectiveness. In addition, little attention has been paid to socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers specifically (e.g., safety- net hospital populations) in CM intervention studies. Our preliminary work indicates that offering small escalating financial incentives for smoking abstinence dramatically increases short-term cessation rates among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers when incentives are included as an adjunct to standard clinic- based smoking cessation treatment. However, additional work is needed to evaluate the influence of this CM approach in the longer-term with a rigorous and adequately powered trial. Thus, the aims of the proposed study are to: 1) evaluate the longer-term impact of an adjunctive, low-cost CM intervention (relative to usual care) on smoking abstinence rates among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals participating in a safety-net hospital smoking cessation program, and 2) identify treatment mechanisms and contextual factors associated with cessation outcomes among intervention participants using both traditional and ecological momentary assessment approaches. Participants seeking smoking cessation treatment at an urban safety net hospital (N = 320) will be randomly assigned to 1) usual care (UC; n = 160) or 2) UC plus financial incentives for biochemically-confirmed abstinence (CM; n = 160). Those randomized to the CM intervention will have the opportunity to earn small gift cards for biochemically-verified abstinence through 12 weeks post-quit. Specifically, participants may earn $20 for abstinence on the quit date, and this amount will increase by $5 with each successive abstinent visit through 4 weeks post-quit ($150 total). Participants may additionally earn $50 gift cards for abstinence at 8 and 12 weeks post-quit. Biochemically-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks post-quit (longer-term abstinence) will be the primary outcome variable, though smoking status will be assessed at all visits. We also hope to gain a better understanding of CM treatment mechanisms and to identify other factors that directly influence cessation via traditional questionnaire and smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment approaches. Smartphone technology allows for ""real-time"" data collection to more accurately capture important cessation-related variables, and will be used to deliver gain-framed messages to support and strengthen the CM intervention. Findings will provide insight about new treatment targets for intervention research, and will demonstrate an effective, inexpensive, and easily implementable means by which to improve longer-term smoking cessation rates among economically disadvantaged smokers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking cessation. Offering incentives for abstinence is an effective approach for promoting short-term smoking cessation, though the longer-term effectiveness of this approach has not been established and little attention has been paid to socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers. The proposed study will evaluate the longer-term impact of offering adjunctive, low- cost financial incentives on smoking cessation among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals participating in a safety-net hospital smoking cessation program, and identify treatment mechanisms and contextual factors associated with cessation using both traditional and ecological momentary assessment approaches.            ",Small Financial Incentives to Promote Smoking Cessation in Safety Net Hospital Patients,8944131,R01CA197314,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Esophagus ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' inducement ', ' Incentives ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' voice box ', ' Larynx Head and Neck ', ' Laryngeal ', ' Larynx ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' psychosocial ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Visit ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' stressor ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' contingency management ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Gifts ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Smoking Status ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' safety net ', ' Abstinence ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' social science research ', ' treatment adherence ', ' clinical practice ', ' financial incentive ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2015,54569,0.28968693142061597
"Maximizing state & local policies to restrict tobacco marketing at point of sale    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The point of sale (POS) is where tobacco companies spend the vast majority of their marketing budget and have enjoyed the greatest freedom from regulation. Regulatory efforts by states and communities have included licensing and zoning laws to limit the number, location and concentration (density) of tobacco retailers, and minimum price laws to reduce the supply of discount tobacco products. State and local agencies are also increasingly focused on eliminating racial and socioeconomic disparities in the amount of marketing and the density of tobacco retailers. Signed into law in June, 2009, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA) will change dramatically the tobacco retail environment because it grants states and communities new power to regulate the time, place, and manner of POS tobacco marketing. The broad goal of the proposed research is to establish timely and crucial national surveillance of how the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and states implement new regulations, the impact on the retail environment, and the response of tobacco companies. The specific aims are to examine changes in tobacco marketing and pack prices in a representative sample of U.S. retailers, conduct implementation research that will guide states and communities seeking to more effectively regulate POS tobacco marketing, measure annual change in the density and composition of tobacco retailers in a representative sample of U.S. counties, and disseminate information on POS marketing and tobacco retailer density nationwide. This will be accomplished using state-of-the-art surveillance and ecological assessment methods to select a longitudinal sample of 2,000 retailers and conduct in-store audits of tobacco marketing and price at three time points. POS policies and their implementation will be accessed via a national survey of tobacco control program leaders in every state, conducted at the same three time points. Six case studies and four legal research projects regarding POS restrictions will also be conducted. The established surveillance mechanism and the dissemination of study results will serve as important resources for national, state, and local efforts to reduce the public health toll attributable to tobacco use.

"Reducing socioeconomic disparities in tobacco dependence treatment outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tobacco use is a leading contributor to racial and socioeconomic health disparities in the US primarily due to an unequal burden of tobacco-related disease from a disproportionate share of smokers in lower socioeconomic (SES) groups in which minorities, particularly African Americans, are disproportionately represented.1-5 Although deemed effective for all smokers,6 the standard cognitive-behavioral treatment for tobacco dependence is significantly less effective for lower SES smokers.7-15 Tobacco dependence treatment, however, has the potential to reduce racial and socioeconomic disparities in achieving long-term abstinence by proactively providing our most at-risk smokers with the specific treatment components they need to achieve abstinence through the existing extensive treatment delivery system.16, 17 Our preliminary studies indicate that in addition to several socio-cultural barriers to engaging in treatment,18 there are several key factors associated with socioeconomic disparities in relapse rates and thus treatment outcomes. These factors include: stress, negative affect, smoking in response to negative affect, delay discounting, locus of control, impulsiveness, exposure to smokers in the environment, and treatment utilization (see Table 1).19, 20 Based on this and other evidence, our overall goal is to revise the standard treatment with specific, evidence-based, cognitive-behavioral strategies to address these key factors as well as target and tailor the approach to more fully meet the needs of lower SES and minority smokers, thereby reducing treatment outcome disparities. We expect: 1) The revised treatment (RT) to reduce socioeconomic disparities in treatment outcomes, and 2) Participants treated with the RT to demonstrate more improvement on each of the key factors associated with disparities than those treated with standard treatment (ST). The specific aims include: 1) Complete a revised draft of a widely utilized standard treatment manual that addresses each of the key factors with treatment components. This aim is partially accomplished (see Appendix for preliminary draft). 2) Using the PEN-3 Model,21-23 target and tailor the daft RT to more fully represent the experiences of smokers who are of lower SES and /or of minority status, particularly African American smokers. 3) Pilot test the targeted/tailored draft RT with three treatment groups (n=5-10 per group) to assess understandability and acceptability and to ensure that it can be delivered in the same timeframe as the ST. 4) Compare the effects of SES on treatment outcomes with socioeconomically and racially diverse participants treated with ST (n=110) and RT (n=110) in a randomized treatment design. 5) Compare the effects of treatment condition on each of the key factors. This innovative approach refines, improves upon, and applies theoretically derived and empirically supported concepts and strategies. If effective at reducing treatment outcome disparities, the manual-driven RT will be easily disseminable as a ""new"" standard, having a sustained and powerful impact on the field and contributing to a reduction in the magnitude of the present tobacco-related racial and socioeconomic health disparities.           Tobacco use is a leading contributor to racial and socioeconomic health disparities in the US primarily due to an unequal burden of tobacco-related disease from a disproportionate share of smokers in African American and lower socioeconomic (SES) groups. Unlike many other health risk behaviors, tobacco-related health disparities are increasing despite a large treatment network of free telephone and in-person counseling services, perhaps due to significant disparities in treatment outcomes. The goal of this project is to revise the standard treatment for tobacco dependence to address key factors associated with treatment outcome disparities and more fully meet the needs of lower SES and African American smokers thereby reducing socioeconomic disparities in tobacco dependence treatment outcomes, halting the alarming increase in tobacco-related health disparities, and reducing a leading cause of racial and socioeconomic health disparities in the US.

"Advancing Tobacco Use Treatment for African American Smokers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With a 50% greater relative-risk of smoking attributed lung cancer than Whites, and the highest overall rates of cancer incidence and mortality in the U.S., African Americans experience disproportionately greater tobacco- related disease burden. Striking health disparities exist despite the fact that African Americans have similar smoking prevalence as Whites, yet smoke fewer cigarettes per day (cpd). In fact, over half of all African American smokers are light smokers (smoke 10 or fewer cpd). To have an impact on the premature mortality of African American smokers, effective treatment for smokers across the smoking continuum must be identified. Varenicline, the leading first-line medication for tobacco use treatment, triples the likelihood of long-term abstinence relative to placebo in those smoking >10 cpd. To date, efficacy of varenicline has not been established in African American smokers or light smokers. The long-term goal of this research is to advance treatment for all African American smokers in order to reduce tobacco-related disease and death. Our primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of varenicline for tobacco use treatment among 500 African American smokers, including a full range of cpd, within a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. We will randomize participants in a 3:2 ratio to receive varenicline (1 mg bid; n=300) or placebo (n=200) for 12 weeks, along with individualized health education counseling for all participants. Our specific aims are to evaluate the efficacy of varenicline to promote abstinence in African American smokers across the continuum of smoking level, to examine efficacy in light smokers and also in moderate to heavy smokers, to characterize nicotine and carcinogen exposure, and to describe biopsychosocial characteristics of this group and evaluate in relation to abstinence. This innovative study will provide the first placebo-controlled evaluatin of varenicline in the full spectrum of African American smokers, and the first to examine varenicline in light smokers. Findings will contribute to advancing effective treatment for African American smokers and for light smokers, and enhancing individualized treatment.

"Brief Interventions to Create Smoke-Free Home Policies in Low-Income Househoulds DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The burden of tobacco use falls disproportionately on low-income populations, through high rates of primary smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke. The remarkable progress in creating smoke-free environments in the U.S. over the past two decades has left smokers' homes as a significant source of exposure to secondhand smoke for both children and nonsmoking adults. Intervention research that identifies effective and practical strategies for reaching the minority of households that still allow smoking in the home has considerable potential to reduce exposure to secondhand smoke, but suitable channels to reach low-income families are limited. The proposed research will develop, evaluate and disseminate a brief smoke-free homes intervention through the established national infrastructure of 2-1-1 call centers. 2-1-1 is a nationally designated 3-digit telephone exchange, similar to 9-1-1 for emergencies or 4-1-1 for directory assistance, that links callers to community-based health and social services. Most 2-1-1 callers are low income. The proposed research has four specific aims: 1) Conduct formative research on intervention messages and materials for promoting smoke-free homes in low-income populations, applicable to both smokers and nonsmokers as household change agents; 2) Conduct a randomized controlled trial in the Atlanta 2-1-1 service area to evaluate the efficacy of a brief intervention to create smoke-free homes among 2-1-1 callers; 3) Conduct replication studies in Houston and North Carolina 2-1-1 systems to systematically test the intervention in varied populations and tobacco control climates; and 4) Disseminate the research tested smoke-free homes intervention through a national grants program to 2-1-1 systems and through the Tobacco Technical Assistance Consortium's linkages to the state and local tobacco control infrastructure in the U.S. Through a collaboration with United Way 2-1-1, a telephone information and referral system reaching millions of low-income and minority Americans, we will develop, test and disseminate a brief intervention to create smoke-free homes. This intervention has the potential to protect large numbers of low-income children and nonsmokers from the dangers of secondhand smoke.",Brief Interventions to Create Smoke-Free Home Policies in Low-Income Househoulds,8896511,U01CA154282,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Grant ', ' Household ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Language ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Persons ', ' North Carolina ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Universities ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Directory ', ' Published Directory ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' nonsmoker ', ' Non-smoker ', ' instrument ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Services ', ' Digit ', ' Digit structure ', ' American ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' secondhand smoke ', ' second hand smoke ', ' environmental tobacco smoke exposure ', ' Environmental Tobacco Smoke ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' Free Will ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Directories ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Qualifying ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Social Health Services ', ' Training and Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' tobacco control ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,1550424,0.1030278628609319
"RCT of An Internet Cessation Program Plus Online Social Network for HIV + Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are 1.1 million persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the US: 60% smoke cigarettes and 75% are interested in quitting. Two-thirds of PLWH use the Internet, making this a promising avenue to deliver smoking cessation treatment. Almost none are currently accessing smoking cessation interventions designed to meet their specific needs and concerns. Cigarette smoking is responsible for 24%--61% of deaths among PLWH, and 30% of non-AIDS defining malignancies. It is driving the alarming rise in lung cancers in this highly vulnerable population. The lack of access to proven, effective, culturally appropriate tobacco cessation services represents a health disparity of the first order.  Cessation websites offer smokers convenience, low (or no) cost, and anonymity; however, there are no publicly available web-based cessation programs specifically designed for PLWH smokers. Smokers living with HIV have high rates of nicotine dependence, anxiety, depression, loneliness, and substance use. We developed Positively Smoke Free on the Web (PSFW), a theory-driven, culturally tailored web-based program designed to address the specific needs of PLWH smokers. Our NCI-funded R21 pilot of PSFW demonstrated moderate-high levels of adherence and yielded higher 3-month abstinence rates compared to standard care (10% vs. 4%). Our prior research on web-based cessation interventions has shown that smokers who participate in an online community - whether passively reading posts by others or actively engaging in online discussions - are more than twice as likely to achieve abstinence even after controlling for a broad range of covariates. In preparation for the proposed study, our partners at the American Legacy Foundation have enhanced and modernized PSFW by integrating an online community platform (now ""PSFW+""), developing a training protocol for PLWH smoker seed users (to provide a critical mass of social network participants), and recruiting and training 11 PLWH smokers for this role. The prototype PSFW+ application has been successfully alpha- and beta-tested in anticipation of the randomized controlled trial.  We propose a study that will compare the efficacy of the PSFW+ smoking cessation website to an attention- matched website promoting cardiovascular health in a randomized controlled trial with repeated measures at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months. Participants will be N=550 PLWH smokers interested in quitting in the next 30 days. All participants will be offered nicotine replacement therapy. It is hypothesized that PSFW+ will outperform the control condition on the primary outcome of 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 months post-randomization. Secondary aims and exploratory analyses will examine theory-driven hypotheses about the mediators and moderators of treatment outcome (e.g., depression, anxiety, social support, loneliness, self-efficacy). Establishing the effectiveness of a web-based smoking cessation program for PLWH that has broad reach and could be scaled to reach PLWH smokers throughout the US would not only represent an enormous advance in the fight against tobacco use in PLWH, but would also provide a clearer understanding of the role of targeted, web-based health interventions in comprehensive HIV care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Smoking rates among persons living with HIV (PLWH) are triple those in the general adult population in the US, and there are few, if any, cessation resources available that address their particular needs. This study will examine the efficacy of a web-based smoking cessation program and online social network specifically developed for PLWH. As one of the first studies of its kind, the proposed research will yield important insights into an intervention approach that could be scaled nationally to reach PLWH smokers throughout the US.

"Self-Affirmation and Responses to Smoking Risk Messages among African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching purpose of the proposed research is to harness new developments in psychological and communication sciences to address a key obstacle in communication-based smoking cessation efforts - the tendency for smokers to react defensively toward smoking risk information - and apply relevant knowledge to the promotion of smoking cessation among African American smokers. The proposed project seeks to evaluate an innovative approach based on self-affirmation theory to suppressing smokers' defensive processing of smoking risk information in a laboratory-based randomized trial involving African American smokers. Specifically, this project aims to 1) determine whether self-affirmation (vs. no self-affirmation) reduces defensive responses toward graphic cigarette warning labels; 2) ascertain whether self-affirmation (vs. no self- affirmation) leads to more negative explicit and implicit attitudes toward smoking, greater intentions to quit, and reduced cigarette consumption following exposure to graphic cigarette warning labels; and 3) investigate whether smoking identity moderates the effects of self-affirmation. The proposed project addresses a major public health concern as well as significant tobacco-related health disparities. This study will advance scientific knowledge on self-affirmation as a mechanism for reducing smokers' defensive processing of smoking risk messages. The findings will be directly relevant to the translation of the basic behavioral science underlying smoking risk communication into enhanced smoking cessation approaches. If self-affirmation functions as expected in the proposed randomized trial, a self-affirmation task can be easily implemented in communication-based smoking cessation interventions to enhance the outcomes. The proposed study will also provide direct evidence relevant to the ongoing public health debate concerning the effectiveness of graphic warning labels as a means of communicating smoking risks in the United States. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project addresses a major public health concern - tobacco control - as well as significant tobacco-related health disparities.

"Using Mobile Technology to Understand and Encourage Mindfulness for Smoking Cessa DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Although most smokers indicate interest in quitting, only 6% quit each year. Mindfulness-based interventions show promise for improving smoking cessation; however, underlying mechanisms are unclear. Furthermore, there is a dearth of research on mindfulness and smoking cessation in underserved populations (i.e., members of racial/ethnic minority groups and individuals with low socioeconomic status [SES]), who often have greater difficulty quitting smoking and experience profound tobacco-related health disparities. Mobile health technology (""mHealth"") is revolutionizing healthcare and might be used to elucidate mechanisms underlying mindfulness and enhance mindfulness-based interventions for smoking cessation.  Claire Adams, Ph.D., an Assistant Professor of Psychology at the Catholic University of America (CUA), is seeking five years of support through the K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award for training and research related to mindfulness, mHealth, advanced statistics, and health disparities research. Dr. Adams' overarching career goals are to inform, develop, evaluate, and disseminate mindfulness- based interventions to promote smoking cessation, prevent cancer and other chronic diseases, and enhance well-being in diverse populations. Through the proposed training plan, Dr. Adams will expand her knowledge and skills with regard to mindfulness, smoking cessation, and health disparities research. In order to fill important gaps in her experience thus far, she will gain specialized training related to mHealth and the advanced statistics necessary for analyzing multi-level and longitudinal data. Dr. Adams will work with her mentoring team (led by Dr. David Wetter and comprising experts in fields of psychology, engineering, public health, and biostatistics) to complete formal coursework, specialized workshops, and directed readings.  Primary research aims are to: 1) utilize advanced statistics and mHealth technology to determine mechanisms through which mindfulness influences smoking cessation, and 2) design and test the feasibility of a mHealth-enhanced mindfulness-based intervention for smoking cessation. Toward the first aim, Dr. Adams will learn and apply advanced multilevel modeling techniques to determine mechanisms underlying mindfulness and smoking cessation in three existing datasets that include diverse samples of smokers. Toward the second aim, Dr. Adams will work with her mentoring team to develop and test the feasibility of a mindfulness-based smoking cessation treatment that is supplemented by between-session text messaging. This program aims to deliver personalized intervention to participants in their natural environments and in the moments when they might benefit most. Findings from this feasibility study will inform and provide pilot data for an R01 application of a larger randomized controlled trial. Dr. Adams will conduct the proposed work at CUA, which will provide space, time, equipment, and other resources for research and training.  The proposed research will be the first known to use mobile technology to examine mechanisms underlying mindfulness and smoking, as well as the first known study to use text messaging to enhance mindfulness- based smoking cessation. Furthermore, all proposed studies will target racially/ethnically diverse and low-SES populations (who are at disproportionate risk for tobacco-related health disparities and have not typically served as participants in mindfulness research). Research findings could be critical in moving forward the scientific study of mindfulness, improving patient outcomes in smoking cessation interventions, preventing cancer and other chronic diseases, and improving quality of life in diverse and underserved populations. The proposed training and research plan would launch Dr. Adams as an independent clinical scientist who conducts multidisciplinary research to inform, develop, evaluate, and disseminate innovative mindfulness- based interventions to improve health in diverse populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S., and mindfulness-based interventions show promise for improving smoking cessation. However, the mechanisms through which mindfulness impacts smoking are poorly understood. Approaches capitalizing on mobile health technology could be critical for increasing our understanding of mindfulness and improving mindfulness-based interventions to promote smoking cessation, prevent chronic disease, and enhance quality of life in diverse populations.",Using Mobile Technology to Understand and Encourage Mindfulness for Smoking Cessa,8915057,K23AT008442,"['Affect ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Americas ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Engineering Psychology ', ' Environment ', ' Equipment ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Reading ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Smoking ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Attenuated ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Techniques ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Cessation Research ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Text ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Affective ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' emotion regulation ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' mindfulness ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' ']",NCCIH,CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF AMERICA,K23,2015,163657,0.29435682992039836
"Yale SCOR on Gender-Sensitive Treatment for Tobacco Dependence     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Yale-SCOR is bringing together leading basic and clinical science experts to establish an interdisciplinary, translational, cross-species program of research aimed at identifying novel therapeutics to address the critical health disparity that female smokers face. Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States. Women, compared to men, have poorer rates of smoking cessation, exacerbated health risks, and FDA-approved medications for smoking cessation may not be as effective for women or have emerging limits due to side effects. However, few attempts have been made to develop gender-sensitive smoking cessation treatments. The considerable body of data suggesting that women are more likely to smoke to regulate negative affect and stress while men are more likely to smoke for the reinforcing properties of nicotine suggests an important direction in the development of a new approach to smoking cessation treatments. Using both preclinical and clinical strategies, our interdisciplinary team will probe te noradrenergic system's effects on stress-reactivity and nicotine reinforcement -hypothesizing that (a) different brain systems modulated by noradrenergic activity are activated by smoking in women and men, and (b) guanfacine (an alpha-2a noradrenergic agonist) can preferentially target these gender-sensitive systems to improve smoking cessation outcomes. Using a translational approach with an interdisciplinary team effort, we are proposing three projects that will have inter-related and shared goals, with each providing unique contributions to the development of gender-sensitive therapeutics. This new application will catalyze Yale's significant resources to support interdisciplinary and translational science in women's health to pursue extremely timely scientific findings that could represent a breakthrough in our understanding of treatments for a public health problem that affects millions daily. Our specific aims and objectives of the Yale-SCOR are to:    AIM 1: Evaluate the role of the noradrenergic system and its interactions with cholinergic and dopaminergic systems, in stress-induced smoking relapse and nicotine-based reinforcement, and use these findings to inform and expedite the development of gender-sensitive therapeutics for smoking cessation.    AIM 2: Mentor junior investigators in conducting interdisciplinary translational research on tobacco use and women's health through training opportunities, including ""clerkships"" with SCOR PIs, and pilot funding.    AIM 3: Be a national resource to invigorate and galvanize the study of sex and gender differences in relation to smoking by providing expert consultation; supporting faculty training awards; mining national data on gender, smoking and health outcomes to inform health policy; and expanding our current program of local and national community outreach.          Women compared to men, have poorer rates of smoking cessation and exacerbated health risks yet few attempts have been made to develop gender-sensitive smoking cessation treatments. This research will contribute to the public health by providing a neurobiologically-informed approach to the development of gender-sensitive therapeutics for smoking cessation, mentoring the next generation of interdisciplinary and translational researchers, and providing a national resource for women's health and tobacco use.            ",Yale SCOR on Gender-Sensitive Treatment for Tobacco Dependence,8870320,P50DA033945,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' California ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cities ', ' Consultations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Dyes ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' London ', ' Los Angeles ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Names ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Registries ', ' Reinforcement (Psychology) ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Benzeneacetamide, N-(aminoiminomethyl)-2,6-dichloro- ', ' Guanfacine ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' Agonist ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Smoker ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Consult ', ' Services ', ' Church ', ' cholinergic ', ' noradrenergic ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' human ESC ', ' human ES cell ', ' hESC ', ' human embryonic stem cell ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Province ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Last Name ', ' Smoking and Health ', ' Smoking and Health Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Instruction ', ' performance site ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' translational approach ', ' FDA approved ', ' smoking relapse ', ' Teacher Training ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Faculty Education ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,P50,2015,1223727,0.2871159896441585
"A Family-Focused Intervention for Asian American Male Smokers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Family-Focused Intervention for Asian American Male Smokers Smoking prevalence remains high in subgroups of Asian American men, particularly among those with low English proficiency (LEP) and immigrants from cultures where smoking prevalence is high, including Chinese and Vietnamese.

The smoking prevalence's among LEP Chinese and Vietnamese men were 32% and 43%, respectively, compared to 16% of the general California male population. We developed a family-focused intervention utilizing lay health worker (LWH) outreach that integrates formative qualitative research and selected constructs from Social Network Theory, Social Cognitive Theory, and the Trans-theoretical Model. The intervention involves 2 small group education sessions with dyads of smokers and family members, and 2 follow-up individual telephone calls delivered by LHWs over 2 months. Our single-group pilot trial with 96 dyads of Chinese and Vietnamese male daily smokers and their family members showed a high feasibility of recruiting unmotivated smokers (42% were at ""precontemplation""), and a promising 7-day point prevalence abstinence rate of 30% at 3 months with independent corroboration from family members. The first aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the family-focused intervention in promoting smoking cessation in Chinese and Vietnamese male smokers. The second aim is to explore mediators to identify key psychosocial and behavioral processes that underlie how the intervention affects the processes of quitting and maintaining abstinence. We will conduct a 2-arm cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with assessments at baseline, 6 and 12 months following intervention initiation. The RCT involves 60 lay health workers (LHWs); each recruits and delivers interventions to 6 dyads of one male daily smoker and one family member from his household, for a total 360 smoker-family dyads. Half of the LHWs, stratified by Asian subgroup and smoking history, will be randomized to the family-focused intervention group and the other half will be assigned to an attention control condition receiving education on healthy eating. All participants will receive written information on smoking cessation resources. We hypothesize that, at 6 and 12 month follow-up, the intervention smokers will be more likely to achieve biochemically verified smoking abstinence (7-day point prevalence), to report having made at least one 24-hour quit attempt, and to report using at least one evidence-based smoking cessation resource (quitline, medication, health professional advice) than smokers in the control condition. Using prospective quantitative data obtained from the RCT, and post-trial dyadic and individual interviews of 30 smokers and 30 family members selected based on abstinence experiences, we will explore mediators at individual, family and social network levels that explain how the intervention affects quitting and maintaining abstinence. The long-term goal is to understand effective ways to utilize family-based and social outreach strategies to reduce tobacco use disparities in hard-to-reach populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will examine the use of an innovative strategy that involves lay health worker outreach to mobilize smokers and their families to promote smoking cessation in Chinese and Vietnamese American men. This project will yield a significant public health impact as it addresses gaps in knowledge about effective strategies for treating tobacco dependence in underrepresented populations where smoking prevalence is disproportionately high such as among Chinese and Vietnamese American men.",A Family-Focused Intervention for Asian American Male Smokers,8917153,R01DA036749,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Attention ', ' California ', ' Chinese American ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Household and Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Household ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Smoking ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' Writing ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Family member ', ' Social Network ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Immigrant ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Smoking History ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' post intervention ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' pilot trial ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' Network-based ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' evidence base ', ' FDA approved ', ' group intervention ', ' population based ', ' arm ', ' ']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2015,659676,0.20319047704545187
"Socioeconomic status and smoking exposure in Appalachia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Social inequalities are an important predictor of disease incidence, including cancer. Persons with low socioeconomic status (SES) have increased rates of lung and other tobacco-related cancers. Although smoking prevalence is higher in persons with lower levels of education and occupational status, smoking prevalence does not explain this excess risk. In prospective cohort studies, the associations between low SES and elevated lung cancer risk persist after adjustment for smoking amount and duration. The investigators' overall hypothesis is that the unaccounted increased risk in populations with lower SES is due to higher smoke exposure that cannot be accounted for by self-reported smoking habits. Their previous laboratory studies demonstrate that there is a wide degree of variation in biological exposure to tobacco smoke toxins and carcinogens per cigarette smoked. The investigators propose to conduct a community-based participatory study in the medically underserved area of Appalachian Pennsylvania to determine the relationship between SES and the dose of inhaled mainstream smoke and the dose of biological markers of tobacco smoke exposure. Specific aims are: Specific Aim 1. Determine whether SES is associated with smoking puffing behaviors including puff volume, duration, interval, and length of cigarette smoked. Specific Aim 2. Determine whether SES is associated with biomarkers of smoking exposure including salivary cotinine and expired carbon monoxide. This addresses the SES hypothesis using biological measures of dose in addition to environmental measures such as puffing dose. Specific Aim 3. Correlate environmental and biological measures of smoke exposure. This aim will determine whether levels of mainstream smoke exposure, as estimated by puffing profiles are determinants of the biological levels of cigarette smoke exposure, and whether this relationship differs by SES. This brings together aims 1 and 2 to comprehensively address the SES hypothesis. Specific Aim 4. Determine the effects of psychological stress, as assessed by psychological scales and salivary stress biomarkers, on smoking puffing parameters and salivary cotinine levels. The proposed research study will be conducted in Appalachia, Pennsylvania (PA), a NIH-designated medically underserved but socioeconomically diverse population. The investigators predict that lower SES is associated with higher smoke intake as determined by topography and smoke biomarkers, and that this finding will help to explain the long-observed patterns of lung cancer incidence disparities. A major objective of cancer control efforts is to understand the causes of social inequalities in cancer rates. Cigarette smokers of lower socioeconomic status (SES) have increased rates of lung cancer and other tobacco-related diseases than smokers of higher SES. Because smoking is a modifiable behavior, findings that demonstrate more intensive smoking and greater exposure to tobacco smoke among low SES smokers may be helpful in developing more effective and targeted smoking control efforts.",Socioeconomic status and smoking exposure in Appalachia,8842960,R01DA026815,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' inspiration ', ' Respiratory Inspiration ', ' Respiratory Aspiration ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' Breathing ', ' Behavior ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Carbon Monoxide ', ' oncogenic agent ', ' Oncogens ', ' Cancer Causing Agents ', ' Carcinogens ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Scotine ', ' 2-Pyrrolidinone, 1-methyl-5-(3-pyridinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Cotinine ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Occupational Status ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incidence ', ' instrumentation ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', ' Medically Underserved Area ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Toxin ', ' Measures ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' smoke inhalation ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Smoker ', ' Cigarette Smoker ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Tobacco smoke ', ' Salivary ', ' Pattern ', ' cancer risk ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Cigarette ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' social inequality ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Intake ', ' Study Section ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' medically underserved ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIDA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2015,280534,0.13817355227099615
"Ovarian Hormones Effect on Smoking Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco smoking is a leading cause of preventable death and disability in the U.S. Although women compared to men are at a greater risk of smoking-related disease morbidity and mortality, research suggests they may smoke for different reasons than men and have a harder time quitting than men. Research identifying female-specific factors underlying addiction is critical for: (a) addressing sex-related health disparities; (b) informing female-specific treatments; and (c) discovering addiction processes that are overrepresented among females yet applicable to both sexes. Ovarian hormones represent a female specific factor implicate in the maintenance of nicotine addiction and success following a quit attempt. This proposal aims to advance this line of research by combining ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with daily hormonal sampling across an entire menstrual cycle to further examine the patterns and mechanisms of ovarian hormone variation effects on smoking in women in real time. The use of prospective daily recordings and hormonal sampling will allow us to test whether smoking will be higher on days with high estrogen and lower on days with high progesterone (Aim 1), that women with greater estrogen to progesterone ratios compared to women with lower estrogen to progesterone ratios across the entire menstrual cycle will smoke more and be more nicotine dependent (Aim 2), and that days with higher estrogen will be marked by greater nicotine reward and worse cognitive control, which will mediate relations between higher estrogen and increased smoking (Aim 3). Secondary aims will explore variability of hormonal effects across the menstrual cycle (Aim 4). As the first comprehensive study investigating daily changes in ovarian hormones, drug reward, cognitive control, and smoking behavior, this project will pave the way for a program of research involving more intensive laboratory and field-based studies of psychoneuroendocrinological underpinnings of smoking in women.  Through expert mentoring, directed readings, formal coursework and seminars, onsite training, attending national scientific meetings, manuscript and grant preparation, mentorship of students in the USC Health, Emotion, and Addiction Laboratory, and the completion of the proposed investigation expertise will be gained in: (a) Naturalistic field assessment of nicotine addiction; (b) EMA design and implementation; and (c) Use of advanced statistical methodology to test the aims outlined by the project. Thus, by the end of the proposed training period, the applicant will be uniquely positioned to run an independent interdisciplinary line of research incorporating both lab and field based studies in investigating female specific factors in addiction.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clarifying the role of ovarian hormones on smoking may aid cessation treatment in women and could provide further evidence for the use of hormone-based medications for smoking cessation in both sexes.

"Addressing Tobacco Use Disparities through an Innovative Mobile Phone Intervention: The textto4gosmokelesstobacco ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rural Americans are a vulnerable group at high risk for tobacco-related illness. Smokeless tobacco use is high among rural Americans at 11% and has not decreased significantly in the past decade. Rural Americans who want to quit have access to few innovative interventions. This is a significant missed opportunity for tobacco control in this population. Scheduled Gradual Reduction (SGR) may be an effective intervention to help smokeless tobacco users quit and has been minimally studied. Delivering SGR interventions via Short Message Service (SMS) text messaging is an innovative way to increase reach of smokeless tobacco cessation interventions in rural populations. We propose a 3-year pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficay of a SGR intervention via SMS text messaging plus SMS Support Messages in decreasing smokeless tobacco use in a rural population. The SGR group (n=60) will receive a four week SGR program delivered via SMS text messages plus SMS support messages. The control group (n=30) will receive SMS support messages to aid in quitting. We will use a variety of recruitment methods to obtain our sample and will use 2:1 treatment allocation strategy to be sure we have an adequate sample in the intervention group to generate reliable effect sizes for future studies. Primary outcomes for each participant will be: 1) proportion of messages read (feasibility); 2) ratings of the usefulness of the intervention received (acceptability) and 3) smokeless tobacco cessation at 3 and 6 months (preliminary efficacy). This will be the first SMS texting intervention using SGR with smokeless tobacco users targeting rural smokeless tobacco users who lack access to innovative and effective interventions. If successful, this study can be easily disseminated to rural smokeless tobacco users to aid in cessation, thus helping to decrease tobacco related health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Available interventions for smokeless tobacco cessation have not targeted those most at risk and have not been easily disseminated too hard to reach populations. The proposed research will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of delivering a Scheduled Gradual Reduction intervention via SMS text messaging paired with text-based counseling messages. The results of this study can be easily disseminated to rural smokeless tobacco users to aid in cessation, thus helping to decrease tobacco related health disparities in rural populations.            ",Addressing Tobacco Use Disparities through an Innovative Mobile Phone Intervention: The textto4gosmokelesstobacco,8957285,R15CA198841,"['Algorithms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' Cues ', ' Data Collection ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patients ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Reading ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Rural Health ', ' Rural Population ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' School Nursing ', ' Schools ', ' Students ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Smoking, Tobacco and Cancer - Smokeless Tobacco ', ' Smokeless Tobacco ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' dry mouth ', ' aptyalism ', ' Mouth Dryness ', ' Hyposalivation ', ' Asialia ', ' Xerostomia ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Schedule ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Rural ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' cancer prevention ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Techniques ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Smokeless Tobacco Cessations ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' R15 Program ', ' R15 Mechanism ', ' Academic Research Enhancement Awards (Area) ', ' Academic Research Enhancement Awards ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Text ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' tobacco control ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Abstinence ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' successful intervention ', ' ']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R15,2015,477000,0.13072023239655828
"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Smoking is a major cause of health disparities, and socioeconomic status (SES) is strongly associated with lower rates of smoking cessation. Several major conceptual models have been proposed that share a key, common mechanism linking SES to health behaviors such as cessation, noting that the life circumstances associated with low SES lead to greater exposure to stress, which then influences behavior. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among low SES individuals is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of SES and social history, contextual and environmental influences, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, and acute momentary precipitants on stress, smoking lapse, and abstinence among 300 smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed using real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of Autosense, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and geographic positioning system (GPS). Autosense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or encounters a stressor. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse and stress ascertained in real time through Autosense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is the first study to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by low SES individuals.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of socioeconomic status, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, context/environment, and acute precipitants on stress, smoking lapse, and abstinence among 300 smokers attempting to quit.                ","Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation",8965058,R01CA190329,"['Affect ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Health behavior ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Motivation ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Poverty ', ' Real-Time Systems ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohesion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Abstinence ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' mindfulness ', ' distress tolerance ', ' social health determinants ', ' ']",NCI,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,665384,0.17713936375383127
"Development of a Tobacco Health Literacy Instrument ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians (AI) have the highest rates of smoking of any racial/ethnic group in the US (41% versus 23% for whites and blacks). Consequently, they suffer the highest mortality from tobacco-related illnesses of any racial/ethnic group; two of every five AI die from a tobacco-related illness. AI youth have a high prevalence of tobacco use as well, where cigarette smoking is reported just below 37% for youth aged 11-18. Tobacco prevention efforts include education materials and programming that deter individuals from starting smoking or encourage individuals to quit smoking. However, we do not know if education efforts are fully understood and resonate with target populations, as indicated by high prevalence rates among AI populations. This may be explained, in part, because tobacco is a sacred plant to many AI and, as such, cannot be treated completely negatively, as most primary and secondary prevention programs do. We propose to create health literacy (HL) instrument that is specific to tobacco knowledge and risk. We believe this is a necessary step in primary and secondary prevention efforts in order to determine the appropriate way to intervene upon behaviors among those who have yet to start smoking, those who smoke and want to quit, and those that smoke and do not want to quit. Therefore, our long-term goal is to improve tobacco education and programming that will lead to better tobacco prevention efforts among AI communities. Our team has successfully used community-based participatory research (CBPR) to address tobacco use with AI communities since 2003. Our community partners requested that we examine additional ways to improve tobacco prevention efforts. We will address the following specific aims: (1) Develop a HL measure that is specific to tobacco use among AI populations by using CBPR to create a culturally relevant instrument that examines tobacco HL knowledge and risk; (2) Determine the reliability and validity of a tobacco HL measure among AI populations by testing it with AI adults (long form, n=250; short form, n=100). We will use experts to estimate content validity and factor analysis on participants' responses to estimate instrument's dimension and reliability. Our rationale for this project is tha the use of a tobacco HL instrument will lead to the design of better primary and secondary prevention tools, thus reducing tobacco-related disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: American Indians (AI) suffer greater tobacco-related health disparities than any other ethnic group in the United States due to rates of tobacco use that are twice as high as other ethnic groups. This study has the potential to help reduce tobacco use among AI and could ultimately help reduce rates of associated cancers (primarily lung) and cardiovascular disease. The tobacco health literacy instrument, if successful, can be incorporated into existing cessation programs and primary prevention efforts throughout the AI population, thus reducing tobacco-related outcomes in this underserved population.            ",Development of a Tobacco Health Literacy Instrument,8893522,R21CA191158,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Kansas ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Plants ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Printing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Measurement ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Oral ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Medical center ', ' proficient in math ', ' numeracy ', ' number sense ', ' mathematical proficiency ', ' mathematical compentency ', ' mathematical compentence ', ' mathematical achievement ', ' mathematic proficiency ', ' mathematic compentency ', ' mathematic compentence ', ' mathematic achievement ', ' mathematic ability ', ' math proficiency ', ' math competency ', ' math competence ', ' math achievement ', ' math ability ', ' mathematical ability ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Reporting ', ' Readability ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Qualifying ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' tobacco control ', ' tobacco use prevention ', ' prevent tobacco use ', ' tobacco prevention ', ' functional health literacy ', ' health literacy ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' northern plains ', ' tribal university ', ' tribal college ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2015,211778,0.10821197205307988
"Unjust Targeting: How Marketing Features Impact Consumer Response and Tobacco Use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research contributes to Tobacco Regulatory Science by connecting (1) tobacco marketing features with (2) consumer affective, cognitive and physiological response to marketing images and (3) tobacco product perceptions and use outcomes in ethnically diverse populations (African American, Asian American, Latino and non-Hispanic white). By identifying key features of tobacco marketing (e.g. colors, descriptors, branding, marketing claims) that optimize consumer response to the marketing and ultimately connecting that to tobacco use outcomes over time, this project adds to the evidence base used to regulate tobacco marketing. This project will provide a comprehensive description of the tobacco marketing landscape and an inventory of 'high impact' tobacco marketing features that produce inequitable outcomes in tobacco use. Additionally, by examining consumers' affective, cognitive and physiologic response to ads, this project will illuminate the underlying mechanisms through which these marketing features operate. The aims of this project are to: (1) describe key features of tobacco marketing targeted towards (a) African Americans, (b) Asian Americans, (c) Latinos (including Mexican Americans, Cubans and Puerto Ricans) and (d) non-Hispanic whites; (2) identify how marketing features impact response to ads for Latinos and Latino subgroups; and (3) for each ethnic group, demonstrate how tobacco product use is initiated and changes as a result of awareness of advertising and having a favorite ad and identify marketing features associated with tobacco product use. To accomplish these aims, the proposed research leverages the infrastructures of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study and the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), linking ad-level data from a PATH ad-hoc study that content codes tobacco marketing images with longitudinal PATH data and conducting an ancillary study to the HCHS/SOL assessing self-report and physiological response to tobacco ads. To execute these aims, I will work with a team of mentors who are internationally known scholars. Dr. John Elder, Professor in the Graduate School of Public Health at San Diego State University will be my primary mentor; Dr. John Pierce, Professor in the Department of Family & Preventive Medicine and Moores Cancer Center at UC-San Diego and a lead investigator on the PATH study and Dr. Lourdes Baezconde-Garbanati, Associate Professor of Preventive Medicine at the University of Southern California and Project Leader on the USC Tobacco Center of Regulatory Sciences (P50) will be secondary mentors. This training will provide me with expertise in longitudinal, epidemiological study design, management and analysis, tobacco use health disparities, tobacco regulatory policy and physiological measurement of ad response. This will facilitate my integration into the Tobacco Regulatory Science community and allow me to achieve my long-term career goal of becoming an independent, leading investigator and expert in Tobacco Regulatory Science with a specific focus on communication-based research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project impacts public health by providing knowledge necessary for the effective regulation of tobacco marketing. By linking specific features of tobacco marketing (e.g. colors, marketing claims, descriptors, branding) to consumers' response to ads and their tobacco product perceptions and use behaviors, this work provides the FDA with insight into how specifically tobacco marketing produces inequitable tobacco use outcomes. Ultimately, this will facilitate tobacco marketing regulations that will result in lower rates of tobacco use and disease and death associated with tobacco use.            ",Unjust Targeting: How Marketing Features Impact Consumer Response and Tobacco Use,8898040,K01DA037903,"['Advertising ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Archives ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' family medicine ', ' Family Practice ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Market Research ', ' Marketing ', ' Mentors ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Perception ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' RQ2 ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Central American ', ' Policies ', ' Research Activity ', ' Measurement ', ' Descriptor ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' South American ', ' Pattern ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' preference ', ' professor ', ' skills ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' risk perception ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dominican ', ' p50 ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily Member 5 Gene ', ' TNFRSF5 ', ' MGC9013 ', ' CDW40 ', ' CD40 ', ' Bp50 ', ' TNFRSF5 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Tobacco Epidemiology ', ' Tobacco Use Epidemiology ', ' Characteristics ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Affective ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' community health study ', ' population health ', ' arm ', ' ']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,220015,0.11660224081716487
"Project Impact: A Culturally-Tailored Adherence Intervention for Latino Smokers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2009, tobacco use was implicated in 438,000 deaths in the U.S. and over 80% of lung cancers were attributed to smoking. Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer death for Latino men and the second leading cause for Latina women. Several pharmacological treatments for smoking cessation have been shown to be effective at improving tobacco abstinence rates, including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Despite the availability of these efficacious treatments, adherence to treatment is a significant barrier for Latinos. Developing novel, effective and culturally targeted interventions that increase NRT adherence among Latinos can ultimately inform clinical practice and improve the cessation rates of Latino smokers seeking to quit. The current study seeks to develop and test a culturally tailored medication adherence intervention that will include text messaging and behavioral components that target the unique needs of Latino smokers. These novel and targeted components will address misperceptions and barriers related to NRT treatment and offer real-time reminders and informational prompts to enhance adherence. In the initial development phase of the research, qualitative methods will be used to develop the Latino-targeted components of the intervention. During the clinical trial phase of the study, 98 Latino smokers interested in quitting will be randomized to one of two groups - Culturally Tailored Adherence (CTA), or 2) Standard Medication Management (SMM). All participants will receive 12 weeks of NRT and will receive ongoing assessments of NRT adherence, tobacco abstinence, and will be assessed on the constructs of our theoretical model (e.g. motivation or behavioral skills). The proposed study will be conducted in the context of a five-year career development program that will provide advanced training in Latino smoking cessation and health, qualitative methods, adherence interventions, tobacco addiction and cessation, and the use of technology in healthcare. The proposed training and research plans aim to promote the applicant's long-term career goal of establishing an independently-funded program of tobacco research with a focus on Latino populations. A comprehensive training plan is proposed, combining mentored research, structured mentorship activities guided by established researchers in the field, formal coursework and workshops, and participation in seminars at Brown University and Butler Hospital. Considering the high rates of non-adherence among Latino smokers involved in smoking cessation treatment, the proposed study addresses several public health concerns related to smoking cessation, cancer, and health disparities among Latinos. We seek to develop and test a culturally tailored intervention that aims to increase adherence to nicotine replacement therapy among Latino smokers. The results of the proposed study can have a beneficial effect on improving cessation rates among this vulnerable subpopulation and ultimately decrease the risks of developing tobacco-related diseases and illnesses.",Project Impact: A Culturally-Tailored Adherence Intervention for Latino Smokers,8914541,K01CA160670,"['neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Elements ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hospitals ', ' Language ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Motivation ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Smoking ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' Training Activity ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Medication Management ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Smoker ', ' programs ', ' treatment days ', ' Treatment Period ', ' treatment duration ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' interest ', ' skills training ', ' experience ', ' self help ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' cultural values ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Smoking and Health ', ' Smoking and Health Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' tobacco abstinence ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Abstinence ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' treatment adherence ', ' clinical practice ', ' Regimen ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K01,2015,140238,0.11278210047544228
"Randomized Trial of an Innovative Smartphone Intervention for Smoking Cessation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is tremendous need for smoking cessation intervention technologies with strong potential population-level impact at the lowest possible cost. That potential can be found in the newest technological innovation in quit smoking interventions: smartphone-based smoking cessation software applications (""apps""). There are over 400 smoking cessation apps, which were downloaded in the United States 3.2 million times during the two-year period 2012 to 2013. No trials of any app's effectiveness for general adult cessation have been published and no NIH-funded cessation intervention trials are in progress-despite the fact this is a high priority NIH funding topic. The enormous usage of smoking cessation apps contrasted with their unknown effectiveness creates a serious scientific gap that could stifle their population-level impact.  Research on US Clinical Practice Guidelines (USCPG) apps begins to address that research gap. But only following the USCPG has had limitations in other modalities of delivery. An approach, called Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), addresses these limitations with both innovative intervention content and highly promising results from six published trials. ACT's innovation is its dual focus on increasing willingness to experience physical cravings, emotions, and thoughts that cue smoking while making values-guided committed behavior changes. We recently developed the first ACT app for smoking cessation, called ""SmartQuit,"" and tested it in a pilot randomized controlled trial (N  196), comparing it with an app that follows USCPG (National Cancer Institute's ""QuitGuide""). Results showed that SmartQuit had: (1) higher participant engagement and satisfaction than QuitGuide, (3) higher levels of acceptance of cravings than QuitGuide, and (3) descriptively higher quit rates (albeit non-significant) than QuitGuide at the two-month follow-up.  Building on these promising results, we propose a fully-powered three-arm randomized controlled trial (n = 811 per arm) that compares SmartQuit to QuitGuide and each app to the NCI's Clearing the Air booklet, which follows the USCPG, to definitively determine whether (1) an USCPG app is more efficacious than a USCPG self-help booklet; (2) an ACT app is more efficacious than a USCPG booklet; (3) an ACT app is more efficacious than a USCPG app.  As millions of people are choosing smartphone apps to help them quit smoking, this innovative study shows exciting promise for improving the success rates of quit smoking apps and thereby lowering healthcare costs and reducing premature tobacco-related deaths.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over the two-year period of 2012-2013, smartphone applications for smoking cessation reached 3.2 million people in the United States and their reach is climbing rapidly. This randomized trial will definitively test a smartphone application-delivered Acceptance & Commitment Therapy intervention for adult smoking cessation. If effective, the smartphone application will provide a cost-effective intervention with maximal population-level impact.            ",Randomized Trial of an Innovative Smartphone Intervention for Smoking Cessation,8912666,R01CA192849,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Air ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Cost Measures ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cues ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Emotions ', ' Insurance ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Publishing ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Sensation ', ' Esthesia ', ' Smoking ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' self help ', ' success ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' technological innovation ', ' Modality ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' cost ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' smoking intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' ']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2015,720669,0.269290121873587
"A mobile intervention to promote cessation in HIV-infected smokers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are nearly one million persons living with confirmed HIV infection (PLWH) in the US, 60% of them smoke cigarettes, and 75% of them are interested in quitting. Almost none are currently accessing smoking cessation interventions designed to meet their specific needs and concerns.  Cigarette smoking is a leading contributor to mortality among PLWH in the HAART era, and it is the direct cause of 30% of non-AIDS defining malignancies. It is driving the alarming rise in cardiac events and lung cancers in this highly vulnerable population. The lack of access to proven, effective, culturally appropriate tobacco cessation services represents a health disparity of the first order. The psychosocial profile of the PLWH-smoker community, characterized by high rates of psychiatric comorbidity, drug and alcohol use, and low levels of social support, suggests that achieving high cessation rates will be a great challenge.  Positively Smoke Free is an intensive, multisession, cessation intervention specifically developed for PLWH smokers. It is currently available as a live, group therapy program and also as a web-based version designed for notebook or desktop computers. In its current form, the web-version is not adoptable to the smartphone platform. Pilot data from randomized, controlled, trials of both formats show promise.  The number of individuals in the US who own smartphones and who use them to access health information on the internet is steadily growing. This growth is most pronounced in the ethnic minority groups that make up the majority of the PLWH community in the US. Behavioral interventions delivered via smartphones offer the advantage of expansive reach, low cost, and immediacy of access to users. A burgeoning body of literature suggests that this may be an especially effective tool for tobacco treatment. mHealth tobacco treatment interventions for PLWH smokers have not yet been explored.  This proposal aims (1) to adapt Positively Smoke Free to the mobile format for smartphones (2) to test the feasibility (i.e. recruitment, adherence, retention, satisfaction, and cost) of mobile Positively Smoke Free (mPSF) in a cohort of 50 PLWH smokers, (3) to complete a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing biochemically confirmed 3-month abstinence rates in subjects (N=50) assigned to the mPSF condition versus those (N=50) assigned to standard care (all subjects will be offered a 3-month supply of nicotine replacement therapy) and (4) to conduct exploratory analyses of putative moderators and mediators of program efficacy.  If the mobile version of PSF is proven to be feasible and efficacious, the project will have short term impact by opening a new vista of tobacco (and other behavioral) treatment for a highly vulnerable group. Study data will provide crucial information for a definitive trial of the intervention. The long-term impact will be reduced tobacco-related morbidity and mortality among PLWH, and a clearer understanding of the role of mHealth in comprehensive HIV care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic of cigarette smoking is fueling an alarming rise in cardiovascular disease and tobacco-related cancers in persons living with HIV. Smokers living with HIV have few, if any, cessation resources available to them that address their particular needs, and HIV care providers have virtually no evidence-base to guide their approach to tobacco treatment. The proposal, if funded, will attempt to address this major public health issue by using mobile-web and smartphone technology to expand the reach of a promising, tailored cessation intervention.",A mobile intervention to promote cessation in HIV-infected smokers,8847700,R34DA037042,"['etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Computers ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Literature ', ' Marketing ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"DISC:  Describe Smoking Cessation in RCT Multi-Component Behavioral Intervention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Behavioral interventions are commonly used to promote smoking cessation. They typically have multiple components and are implemented over time. Smokers' engagement and response behaviors change over the course of interventions, resulting in substantial individual variations in outcomes. However, methods are underdeveloped for characterizing smokers' complex behaviors in longitudinal multi-component interventions. Internet-based and face-to-face culturally-tailored interventions are two promising, but relatively unexplored, behavioral interventions. The first is cost effective for reaching generl smoking populations, yet we know little about how to adequately measure individuals' dynamic online engagement with an intervention or examine its efficacy. The second targets specific populations, but we need to learn how racial/ethnic groups respond to such interventions and how much cultural tailoring is useful. We propose a new pattern-recognition approach to characterize complex engagement/response behaviors during Internet-based and culturally tailored interventions. Our approach is built on the PI's preliminary smoking behavior studies, for which she developed a multiple-imputation-based fuzzy clustering model (MI-Fuzzy) to identify pregnancy smoking behavioral patterns, and to cope with real-world situations where smokers have memberships in multiple clusters and their smoking data are longitudinal, non-normal, high dimensional and contain many missing values. Herein, we will enhance MI-Fuzzy with new features, compare it to typical models, and expand our pattern approach to two longitudinal behavioral intervention studies: (1) Dr. Houston's large-scale NCI-funded, Quit-Primo Internet intervention for a general smoking population, and (2) Dr. Kim's small-scale NIDA-funded cognitive, culturally tailored, clinic-based TDTA intervention for a minority smoking population. We will characterize smokers' online engagement (Quit-Primo) and cognitive responses (TDTA), evaluate how the interventions' components work for different smokers, clarify their efficacy, and provide a new, detailed understanding of how smokers' trajectory patterns relate to different cessation outcomes. Better understanding of how smokers engage with and respond to interventions will help uncover important relationships missed by traditional approaches, yield new evidence on how to improve these interventions for targeted populations and on high-risk behavioral patterns that may be clinically important for early intervention. Examining different types of behavioral interventions will also facilitate generalizing our pattern approach to other substance-use studies and populations. By providing analytical prototypes and accessible tools, this study will advance general pattern recognition methodology, and accelerate its utility in behavioral studies of substance use. As our dissemination activities expand, this work will likely stimulate similar studies for better and targeted interventions, ultimately benefiting patient-centered care related to substance use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Behavioral interventions are commonly used to help people quit smoking, among which Internet-based and culturally tailored interventions are promising but relatively unexplored formats. Even when interventions are delivered uniformly, smokers engage with and respond to them differently. Our innovative pattern-recognition approach, MI-Fuzzy, will help characterize smokers' complex engagement and response behaviors during interventions, evaluate how intervention components work for different types of smokers, clarify the efficacy of each intervention, and provide a new, detailed understanding of how smokers' distinct behavioral patterns are associated with cessation outcomes. Better insight on smokers' engagement and responses during interventions will help improve these interventions for targeted populations and learn about high-risk behavioral patterns that may be clinically important for early intervention. By testing MI-Fuzzy in two funded studies (one Internet-based and one culturally tailored) and providing accessible software tools, our study will accelerate behavioral research on substance use, thereby benefiting large numbers of patients with substance use issues.",DISC:  Describe Smoking Cessation in RCT Multi-Component Behavioral Intervention,8849418,R01DA033323,"['Asian Americans ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Smoking ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Computer Software Tools ', ' Software Tools ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Funding ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' behavior change ', ' Korean American ', ' user friendly computer software ', ' user friendly software ', ' Population Study ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Cognitive ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Pattern Recognition ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Characteristics ', ' groupings ', ' Grouping ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' microsystems ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' demographics ', ' implementation science ', ' smoking intervention ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2015,230054,0.1661892452701728
"Sex Differences in the Mechanisms that Promote Nicotine Reward and Withdrawal DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use remains a major public health and economic concern, particularly in women who are more vulnerable to the long-term health consequences of smoking than men. Despite the magnitude of the problem, there is a fundamental knowledge gap in our understanding of the mechanisms that promote tobacco use in females. If this knowledge gap is not filled, then reducing tobacco use and developing specialized medications for female smokers will remain largely incomprehensible. The long-term goal of our research program is to identify the mechanisms that mediate tobacco use among different clinical populations that are uniquely susceptible to this problem. The objective of this renewal is to determine the neural mechanisms that promote tobacco use in females. The central hypothesis is that females are more susceptible to tobacco use than males because of stronger rewarding effects of nicotine and heightened anxiety produced by withdrawal from this drug. Our mechanistic hypothesis is that estradiol (E2) promotes the rewarding effects of nicotine and magnifies the stress produced by nicotine withdrawal in females. More specifically, we postulate that sex differences in response to nicotine are modulated within the neural circuits of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), where dopamine is increased following nicotine administration and decreased during withdrawal from this drug. Thus, females experience greater rewarding effects of nicotine in the presence of E2, which promotes dopamine release in the NAcc. Following repeated nicotine exposure, opponent processes develop to counteract the chronic over-activation of dopamine release. We suggest that the emergence of these opponent processes is evident during withdrawal from chronic nicotine as an increase in the stress hormone, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in the NAcc. This increase in CRF levels enhances the inhibitory tone in the NAcc, which results in a decrease in dopamine release during nicotine withdrawal. Thus, females experience greater anxiety during nicotine withdrawal in the presence of E2, which promotes the recruitment of opponent stress systems that suppress dopamine release in the NAcc. The proposed studies reflect a multi- disciplinary approach involving neurochemical, behavioral, and gene transfer techniques to compare sex differences in the rewarding effects of nicotine (Aim 1) and the aversive states produced by withdrawal (Aim 2) because both of these factors are believed to promote tobacco use in females. The approach to studying sex differences involves comparisons of male, female, and OVX female rats. If the removal of ovarian hormones reverses the proposed measures in females, then the role of E2 will be assessed in OVX rats that will receive E2 supplementation and will be tested following E2 or vehicle administration. At the completion of this project, our findings will help us develop a unifying hypothesis regarding the factors that promote tobacco use in females. This exemplifies the significance of this research because a better understanding of the mechanisms that fuel tobacco use in females will lead to more effective treatments to reduce health disparities in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because our findings will be an important step toward elucidating the neural substrates that promote addiction pathology in women.

"Enhancing cancer outreach for low-income adults with innovative smoking cessation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence indicates that the prevalence of current cigarette smoking among adults in the US has dropped below 20%. While this drop is encouraging, smoking still represents the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the US. Moreover, smoking prevalence is significantly higher among certain population groups, such as those with low levels of education and those living at, or below the poverty level. Therefore, efforts to target these underserved populations with efficacious smoking cessation treatments represents a vital public health effort. The overarching goal of this group-randomized trial is to design and evaluate a novel smoking cessation program targeted to uninsured and underinsured individuals. Key elements of the proposed study will be the use of an established network of community sites (e.g., community centers and churches) and a mobile unit, enabling us to reach individuals confronted with significant barriers to utilizing more traditional smoking cessation treatment approaches.       Specific aims of the study will be to: 1) Compare the efficacy of three smoking cessation interventions targeting community based low income uninsured and underinsured individuals in a group-randomized trial. The interventions will include a Standard Care (SC) approach, consisting of brief advice to quit smoking, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and self-help written materials; an Enhanced Care (EC) approach, consisting of the standard care components plus a single health feedback and motivational interviewing counseling session and a cell phone-delivered text/graphical messaging component; and an Intensive Care (IC) approach, consisting of all SC and EC components plus a series of 11 cell phone-delivered proactive counseling sessions and a cell phone-delivered text/graphical messaging component; 2) Evaluate the role of quit motivation, nicotine withdrawal, risk perception, self- efficacy, social support, and negative affect as potential mediators of smoking abstinence; and 3) Compare the cost-effectiveness of the three treatment conditions.       We believe that of the three conditions, the IC will most successfully address the needs of low-income smokers for several reasons. First, the IC program will be personalized, individualized, and equipped with an intensive, extended counseling and support module provided over the cell phone. Second, the program will combine three intervention components featuring high potential for maintaining support and motivation to quit and prevent relapse. Third, the IC intervention makes use of cell phone technology - an approach that has demonstrated feasibility and efficacy among low-income smokers in previous research conducted by the investigative team. The proposed study offers a number of features (proximity of services to the place of residence, provision of cell phones, etc.) that are likely to reduce treatment barriers while enhancing participant recruitment and retention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will use an existing network of community sites and a mobile unit to deliver smoking cessation treatment to a multiethnic population of uninsured and underinsured adults living in the greater Houston, Texas metropolitan area. The treatments will include components such as brief advice to quit, nicotine patch, written materials, motivational interviewing/health feedback counseling, text/pix messaging, and proactive cell phone counseling.",Enhancing cancer outreach for low-income adults with innovative smoking cessation,8793137,R01CA141628,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Mammary Carcinoma of the Female Breast ', ' Female Breast Cancer ', ' Female Breast Carcinoma ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Elements ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Impact of Retail Tobacco Advertising on Youth Smoking ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Flavored tobacco products are cheap, sweet, and appealing to youth. The Federal Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act banned flavored cigarettes other than menthol in 2009, but little cigars and cigarillos (referred to as small cigar) are still sold in a variety of fruit, sweet, and alcohol/cocktail flavors. Electronic cigarettes ar sold in more than 7,500 flavors, including Juicy Peach, Very Vanilla, and Tutti Frutti Gumballs. In addition, retail marketing of small cigars and e-cigarettes as low-cost alternatives to cigarette smoking likely contributes to their growing popularity among adolescents. This proposal seeks continued funding to better understand the impact of retail tobacco marketing on adolescent tobacco use, with a change in focus from studying cigarettes to cigarette substitutes/complements. Specifically, this longitudinal study aims to: (1) test whether adolescents' exposure to retail marketing for flavored small cigars and e-cigarettes is associated with higher odds of past-month and ever use of these products at two timepoints; (2) examine how promotion and price of flavored small cigars and e-cigarettes change over time and as a function of student demography at nearby schools and the proportion of school-age residents in the neighborhood; (3) characterize the strength of local tobacco retailer licensing and test whether stronger licensing predicts higher prices for flavored products; and (4) disseminate research results to federal, state and local stakeholders concerned with regulating tobacco products and marketing. To accomplish these aims, data about adolescents' use of small cigars and e- cigarettes will be obtained from the California Student Tobacco Survey (CSTS), a biennial surveillance survey conducted for the California Tobacco Control Program (in academic years 2015-16 and 2017-18). Each administration of the CSTS will yield responses from approximately 25,000 students (grades 6-12) attending 140 schools that are stratified by region. In conjunction with the CSTS surveys, trained observers will assess the availability, placement, promotion and price of flavored small cigars and e-cigarettes in a random sample of 500 licensed tobacco retailers within walking distance of the surveyed schools. The proximity of tobacco retailers to schools will be determined using a GIS dataset of campus boundary files that better reflects the school environment than previous methods. Multilevel modeling will test whether greater promotion and lower prices of flavored small cigars and e-cigarettes is associated with higher odds of current and ever use by students at nearby schools, adjusting for both individual-level characteristics and school-level demographics. The proposed research would inform tobacco control policy and regulatory science by advancing our understanding of the health risks associated with the retail availability and promotion of flavored tobacco products near schools.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While the prevalence of cigarette smoking has declined among adolescents, use of electronic cigarettes has tripled in three years, and use of little cigars and cigarillos is increasing, particularly among African American youth. Our previous research found more advertising and lower prices for menthol cigarettes at stores near schools with more African American students, and identified exposure to retail marketing as a risk factor smoking initiation. To inform tobacco control policy and regulatory science of flavored tobacco products, the proposed research will test parallel hypotheses about the retail availability and promotion of flavored little cigars/cigarillos and e-cigarettes near schools and its impact on adolescent use of these products.            ",Impact of Retail Tobacco Advertising on Youth Smoking,8988249,R01CA067850,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Advertising ', ' Age ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' California ', ' Confection ', ' Candy ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Demography ', ' Environment ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Fruit ', ' Health ', ' Heating ', ' Household ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Marketing ', ' Cyclohexanol, 5-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)- ', ' Menthol ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Perception ', ' Propanediols ', ' Propylene Glycols ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sales ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Solutions ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Twins ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Wales ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' Walking ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Licensing ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Flavoring Agents ', ' Flavoring ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' Cigarette ', ' Cigar ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Reporting ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Advertisements ', ' Peach ', ' Vanilla ', ' Genus Vanilla ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cigar Smoking ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Smoking Prevention ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' tobacco control ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' tobacco use prevention ', ' prevent tobacco use ', ' tobacco prevention ', ' cost ', ' adolescent smoking ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' surveillance data ', ' never smoker ', ' Junior High Student ', ' Junior High School Student ', ' Middle School Student ', ' High School Student ', ' ']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,330825,0.10409685999056667

"Understanding Disparities in Quitting in African American and White Smokers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial/ethnic differences in smoking are well documented; African Americans smoke fewer cigarettes per day than Whites but experience disproportionately greater smoking attributable morbidity and mortality. Well documented disparities also exist in smoking cessation with African Americans consistently quitting at lower rates than Whites. However, to-date, no adequately powered study, stratified on race, has been conducted to confirm this finding using a rigorous study design or to understand the mechanisms accounting for differential quit rates in African Americans relative to Whites. The objectives of this application are to 1) describe the differences in smoking cessation among AA and White smokers treated with varenicline, 2) identify the smoking, psychosocial, treatment process, and biological factors that independently explain the relationship between race/ethnicity and cotinine-verified 7-day abstinence in African American and White smokers, and 3) examine the side effect profile of varenicline by smoking level. These aims will be accomplished through a prospective cohort intervention study, stratified on race, age (< 40, > 40), and gender among 448 participants (224 African American, 224 White). All participants will receive 3 months of varenicline, the most effective of currently available smoking cessation medications, standard educational materials, and six sessions of smoking cessation counseling. This study is innovative. It will be the first known study to report on the use of varenicline in As, the first to examine varenicline in light smokers (<10 cpd) and among a wide range of smoking levels (3-20 cpd), the first head-to-head study, stratified on race, designed to prospectively compare pharmacotherapy in AAs versus Whites, and one of a few to explore mechanisms underlying disparities in quitting between AA and White smokers. The impact of these findings will be considerable, having ramifications for treatment, clinical practice, and policy. Significan knowledge will be gained about African American-White differences in quitting. Findings have the potential to improve tobacco use treatment by moving the field away from a generic focus on race/ethnicity toward a targeted focus on modifiable smoking, psychosocial, and treatment process factors most relevant to African Americans and to Whites.          African Americans smoking fewer cigarettes per day and experience greater smoking-related disease and death, yet consistently quit smoking at lower rates than Whites. Little is known about the reasons for this disparity. This study will examine mechanisms explaining lower quit rates in African Americans relative to Whites and has the potential to significantly improve tobacco use treatment outcomes by identifying specific barriers and facilitators to quitting smoking for African Americans and for Whites.

"Behavioral Economic Approach to Reducing Maternal Smoking in Disadvantaged Women  PROJECT SUMMARY Smoking among women is a substantial U.S. public health problem that is highly associated with socioeconomic status, especially low educational attainment. It is also a direct contributor to health disparities. For example, smoking prevalence in the U.S. exceeds 30% among women with < 12 years of education compared to less than 6% for women with graduate degrees. Smoking prevalence among disadvantaged mothers is at strikingly high levels (40-60%). Disadvantaged women begin smoking at an earlier age, are heavier smokers, and are more likely to be nicotine dependent and to fail at smoking cessation. Not surprisingly, disadvantaged women are also at increased risk for smoking-related adverse health outcomes, including adversely impacting the health of their children through in-utero and second-hand smoke exposure (SHSe). Despite widespread awareness of the adverse health consequences of SHSe, almost 85% of U.S. children from low-income families are chronically exposed. SHSe, especially from maternal smoking, increases risk for infant death, chronic respiratory infections, asthma, and other longer-term medical problems, and is estimated to increase direct medical and life-lost costs in the U.S. by > $5 billion annually. Efficacious interventions to increase maternal smoking cessation and reduce childhood SHSe are sorely needed. In this application we are proposing to test the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an intervention for promoting smoking-cessation among economically disadvantaged mothers of young children (< 11 yrs) that is based in the conceptual framework of behavioral economics and uses financial incentives to motivate behavior change. We are proposing to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing (1) usual care for smoking cessation and reducing SHSe among children, (2) usual care combined with financial incentives for objectively verified smoking abstinence and (3) usual care combined with financial incentives and also with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) using innovative procedures to enhance medication efficacy. We hypothesize that both interventions involving financial incentives will increase biochemically-verified smoking abstinence in mothers and decrease SHSe in their children, but that the largest and most cost-effective treatment effects will be achieved by combining financial incentives with NRT. Behavioral-economic measures of decision-making biases and cigarette-price sensitivity will be examined as predictors of treatment response. Overall, the proposed study has the potential to advance knowledge on efficacious, cost-effective smoking cessation for maternal smokers and protection against SHSe in children. The study also has the potential to impact policies and clinical practices regarding recommended care for combating chronic SHSe in disadvantaged children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are proposing to examine new strategies for helping economically disadvantaged mothers of young children to quit smoking and better protect their children from the harmful effects of being regularly exposed to cigarette smoke. We are especially interested in whether offering financial incentives for quitting and medications to reduce nicotine withdrawal might increase the proportion of mothers who successfully quit smoking and reduce smoke exposure and related illnesses among their children.            ",Behavioral Economic Approach to Reducing Maternal Smoking in Disadvantaged Women,8610398,R01HD078332,"['Age ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Scotine ', ' 2-Pyrrolidinone, 1-methyl-5-(3-pyridinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Cotinine ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' University Hospitals ', ' inducement ', ' Incentives ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mothers ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine ', ' Nicotine Withdrawal ', ' Pregnancy Complications ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Respiratory Infections ', ' Respiratory Tract Infections ', ' Risk ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' smoke of cigarettes ', ' cigarette smoke ', ' Policies ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' infantile death ', ' infant demise ', ' death in first year of life ', ' infant death ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Cigarette ', ' Participant ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Intake ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Community Practice ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' in utero ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' motivated behavior ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' maternal smoking ', ' maternal cigarette smoking ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' discounting ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' treatment effect ', ' trial comparing ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment response ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' clinical practice ', ' efficacy testing ', ' financial incentive ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2015,593709,0.20984977137699234
"Telephone-Delivered Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Smoking Cessation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Smoking cessation telephone quit lines (QLs), available in all 50 states; now serve over 500,000 smokers each year. On average, only 14% (range: 8% to 20%) of QL callers stop smoking by the 12 month follow-up even with the aid of traditional Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) combined with pharmacotherapy (typically nicotine replacement therapy; NRT). The low quit rates of QLs stifle their great potential public health impact. To address the low quit rate problem, and thereby start a new research paradigm focused on innovative QL behavioral intervention content, we propose to test a novel counseling approach, called Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), as a telephone-delivered quit smoking intervention. We recently completed a small (N = 121) NIDA R21 pilot randomized QL trial of proactively-delivered ACT vs. CBT in state QL callers that was underpowered due to R21 budget limits. Results showed that ACT: (1) was feasible to implement and evaluate in a state QL context, (2) had higher participant engagement and satisfaction than CBT, (3) had higher levels of acceptance of cravings than CBT, which in turn predicted quitting smoking, and (4) had higher (albeit non-significant) 6-month post randomization quit rates than CBT. Building on these promising and non- definitive results, a comparative effectiveness randomized trial with a large and fully-powered sample size (N = 1168) and longer term follow-up (i.e., 12 months) is now needed to definitively determine whether telephone- delivered ACT: (1) provides higher quit rates than CBT, (2) operates according to its theory-based mechanisms, and (3) is more cost-effective than CBT. Accordingly, we propose to conduct a randomized comparative effectiveness trial of telephone-delivered ACT counseling plus NRT (n=584) versus telephone-delivered traditional CBT counseling plus NRT (n=584) in state quit line callers, in order to demonstrate that telephone-delivered ACT: (1) has significantly higher 30-day point prevalence abstinence at 12 months post-randomization than telephone-delivered traditional CBT; (2) has smoking cessation outcomes significantly mediated by three psychological processes central to the theoretical model underlying ACT: acceptance of internal (a) sensations, (b) emotions, and (c) thoughts that cue smoking; (3) Will be significantly more cost-effective than telephone-delivered CBT, as measured by cost per additional quitter, incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER), and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The study, well-motivated by preliminary results, shows exciting promise for improving the success rates of quit lines and thereby lowering healthcare costs and reducing premature tobacco-related deaths. If shown to be efficacious and cost-effective, ACT would provide the scientific field a new conceptual model of QL intervention and quit lines a new treatment approach that could help 45,000 more (of the 500,000) quit line callers to stop smoking each year, thereby saving in medical costs and prolonging lives.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Smoking cessation telephone quit lines (QLs), available in all 50 states; now serve over 500,000 smokers each year. This randomized trial will definitively test a telephone-delivered Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT) intervention for adult smoking cessation.

"Developing a Culturally Relevant Model of Smoking Cessation among Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Yessenia Castro, Ph.D., is a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Health Disparities Research at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). She is seeking five years of funding through the National Cancer Institute's Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to Promote Diversity (K01). Dr. Castro conducts research examining social, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and cultural determinants of smoking cessation in minority and underserved populations under the mentorship of Dr. David Wetter. MDACC provides an unusually rich training environment that includes an extraordinary number of workshops, seminars, and courses; outstanding opportunities for developing skills in grant writing, publication, and project management; and superb resources for assisting young investigators.     Dr. Castro's long term career goals are to serve as an independent, research-oriented faculty member in a university environment, and to develop a program of research focused on understanding culturally relevant influences of cancer risk behaviors, with a particular focus on smoking among Latinos. Such a program could improve smoking cessation interventions tailored for or targeted at Latinos, and ultimately aid in eliminating health disparities among this population.     In the current proposal, Dr. Castro delineates four short term goals to be achieved throughout the award period that are intended to serve as the foundation for an independent research career. These are: 1) accumulate a strong knowledge base in the social, cognitive, and affective mechanisms and processes involved in tobacco dependence and cessation among underserved adult populations; 2)extend her current knowledge of research on gender and race/ethnicity into the area of cancer prevention; particularly, smoking cessation among Latinos; 3) gain knowledge and experience in culturally competent community level research from a public health perspective, and; 4) learn the appropriate statistical methods and modeling techniques for evaluating complex longitudinal data. These goals will be achieved through a combination of: 1) rigorous formal coursework and directed readings; 2) numerous professional development experiences; 3) numerous project implementation, data analysis, and manuscript writing/publication experiences, and; 4) intensive mentoring by a team of highly successful scientists with diverse expertise, such that each mentor can provide invaluable guidance in achieving a specific short term goal, but most can advise about more than one goal.     The proposed research plan seeks to address the paucity of existing research addressing the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation among Latinos. Research in addictions and health behavior has identified a number of individual-level factors that are key determinants of smoking cessation including social/environmental, inter-/intrapersonal, and cognitive/affective factors. Emerging research suggests that many of the known determinants of smoking cessation may be of equal importance to minority smokers, but more research is needed in this area, as noted by several prominent publications including the Surgeon General's Report and the Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence Clinical Practice Guideline. Further, with the exception of data addressing the influence of acculturation on smoking prevalence, almost nothing is known about the effect of acculturation and other culturally relevant variables (e.g., acculturative stress, perceived discrimination) on the process of smoking cessation. Thus, the proposed project will utilize data from three longitudinal studies of Latino smokers to examine the impact of culturally relevant factors on mechanisms of smoking cessation. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a comprehensive conceptual model linking cultural factors to mechanisms of smoking cessation that is informed by previous work addressing the impact of culture on mental and physical health, socioeconomic status influences on health, and theories of addictive behaviors. Additionally, the project will evaluate specific, fine-grained hypotheses using data collected with state-of-the-science ecological momentary assessment techniques. Although Latinos are less likely to smoke, they exhibit more difficulty quitting, are less likely to seek or receive help with quitting, and are at high risk of developing tobacco related chronic illnesses. Further, very little is known about the determinants of smoking cessation among Latinos, or how factors specific to minority status influence determinants of cessation. Advancing knowledge in these areas would help to identify treatment targets, improve current smoking cessation interventions, and ultimately aid in eliminating health disparities among Latinos.",Developing a Culturally Relevant Model of Smoking Cessation among Latinos,8910260,K01CA157689,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Grain ', ' Cereals ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Learning ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Motivation ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Stressful Event ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Gender ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Addictive Behavior ', ' Latino ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Techniques ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' psychosocial ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Surgeon ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' M.D. ', ' Doctor of Medicine ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cognitive ', ' University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ', ' MDACC ', ' University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Affective ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2015,139896,0.2390387364812734
"A trial of Positively Smoke Free group therapy for HIV-infected smokers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are 1.1 million persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the US, 60% of them smoke cigarettes, and 75% of these are interested in quitting. Almost none are currently accessing smoking cessation interventions designed to meet their specific needs and concerns.  Cigarette smoking is responsible for 24% of deaths among PLWH, and 30% of non-AIDS defining malignancies. It is driving the alarming rise in cardiac events and lung cancers in this highly vulnerable population. The lack of access to proven, effective, culturally appropriate tobacco cessation services represents a health disparity of the first order. The psychosocial profile of the PLWH-smoker community, characterized by high rates of psychiatric comorbidity, drug and alcohol use, and low levels of social support, suggests that achieving high cessation rates will be a great challenge.  Positively Smoke Free (PSF) is an intensive, multisession, group cessation program specifically developed for PLWH smokers. A pilot study of PSF yielded promising results. This proposal aims (1) to perform a definitive efficacy study of PSF by comparing 6-month biochemically confirmed abstinence rates in subjects randomized to PSF vs. standard care in a cohort of 450 PLWH smokers, (2) to determine the sociobehavioral moderators and mediators associated with successful cessation, and (3) to complete a careful cost analysis of PSF in order to estimate the incremental cost per quit associated program participation.  If PSF is proven to be effective it will establish a new treatment option for PLWH smokers. Determination of moderators and mediators of program success will provide insight into the mode of action of the intervention and will help guide the development of additional treatment strategies in the future. Finally, the cost analyses will provide critical information abut the feasibility of program dissemination and implementation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic of cigarette smoking is fueling an alarming rise in lung and other cancers in persons living with HIV (PLWH). Smokers living with HIV have few, if any, cessation resources available to them that address their particular needs, and HIV care providers have virtually no evidence base to guide their approach to tobacco treatment.

"Financial Incentives for Smoking Cessation Among Disadvantaged Pregnant Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking during pregnancy is the leading preventable cause of poor pregnancy outcomes in the U.S.  Most pregnant smokers continue smoking through pregnancy producing serious immediate and longer-term adverse health consequences for the infant.    Smoking during pregnancy is highly associated  with  economic  disadvantage and a substantive contributor to health disparities.     Efficacious  interventions  are  available  but  cessation  rates  are  low  (<20 percent)  and  improvements  in  birth  outcomes often modest or absent.  Current treatments usually entail relatively brief, low-cost interventions (e.g. pregnancy-specific quit lines).  There is broad consensus that more effective interventions are sorely needed.    We  have  developed  a  novel  behavioral-economic  intervention  in  which  women  earn  financial  incentives contingent on smoking abstinence.  In a meta-analysis of treatments for smoking during pregnancy, effect sizes achieved with financial incentives were several-fold larger than those achieved with lower-intensity approaches or medications.    The  intervention  also  appears  to  improve  birth  outcomes  and  increase  breastfeeding duration.  While highly promising, further research is needed in at least three areas.  (1) The evidence on birth outcomes and breastfeeding is from studies that combined data across trials rather than a single prospective trial, (2) whether the intervention produces other postpartum improvements in health has not been investigated, and (3) the overall cost-effectiveness of this approach has not been examined.    To  examine  these  unanswered  questions,  we  are  proposing  a  randomized,  controlled  clinical  trial  comparing  the  efficacy  and  cost  effectiveness  throuh  one-year  postpartum  of  current  best  practices  for  smoking-cessation  during  pregnancy  vs.  best  practices  plus  financial  incentives  among  230  pregnant,  Medicaid  recipients.   We  will  also  include  a  third  condition  of  115  pregnant  non-smokers  matched  to  the  smokers on socio-demographic and health conditions to compare the extent to which the treatments reduce  the burden of smoking and to estimate how much more might be accomplished by further improvements in this  incentives intervention without exceeding cost-effectiveness.  We hypothesize that best practices plus financial  incentives will be more effective than best practices alone, that the incentives intervention will be cost effective,  and  that  while  adding the  incentives  reduces  a  greater  proportion  of  the  health  and  economic  burden  of  smoking than best practices alone, more can be done while remaining cost effective.     Overall, the proposed study has the potential to substantially advance knowledge on cost-effective smoking cessation for pregnant women.    Importantly,  because  of  the  strong  association  between  smoking  during  pregnancy  and  economic  disadvantage,  the  proposed  study  also  has  the  potential  to  contribute  new  knowledge relevant to reducing the serious challenges of health disparities.              PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We  will  examine  whether  adding  financial  incentives  to  current  best  practices  for  smoking  cessation  during  pregnancy  (i.e.,  counseling  using  a  telephone  quit-line)  increases cessation rates and improves infant health.  While more expensive upfront,  this  treatment  approach  may  be  economically  justified  by  the  later  cost  savings  associated  with  more  women  quitting,  having  healthier  babies,  and  needing  less  healthcare.

"LGBT Adults and Tobacco Stigma: A Qualitative Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary focus of this proposed study is to consider the potential unintended consequences of tobacco denormalization strategies for LGBT adults. In particular, we will examine the processes of stigmatization as they relate to tobacco denormalization, tobacco use, and sexual and gender identities. This project expands our research portfolio on tobacco-related stigma. Currently we are funded to examine perceptions of tobacco denormalization among African American young adults in California. We will address the following aims: 1. Understand perceptions of tobacco denormalization strategies and related beliefs and attitudes about the stigmatization of tobacco among LGBT smokers and former smokers in California; 2. Examine the ways in which the stigmatization of tobacco use may intersect with sexual and gender identity stigmas; 3. Explore alternative strategies that may be more effective in reducing the prevalence of smoking among  LGBT adults in California. This study includes 2 phases. In Phase 1, we will conduct asynchronous online group interviews in 10 forums where LGBT adults meet and engage online. Phase 2 will consist of 240 in-depth qualitative interviews conducted with LGBT adults who live in California. The sample will be stratified by sexual/gender identity status, smoking status (current smoker/former smoker), and age (young adults/adults) with 15 participants included in each cell. Complementing online group interviews with in-person individual interviews will help to reveal group norms and beliefs as well as the plurality of beliefs within the group to yield a more holistic understanding of study aims. Using a pattern-level approach to the analysis of the narrative data from phases 1 and 2, we will investigate the processes of tobacco-related stigmatization and its relationship to tobacco denormalization for LGBT adults, as well as how the overlapping stigmas of other social identities may shape the experience of tobacco-related stigma for LGBT adults. Results from the study will be disseminated through traditional conference presentations and academic journal publications, as well as through a project website that includes an accessible presentation of study findings and a social media forum to solicit feedback from study participants and people concerned about the high prevalence of smoking among LGBT adults. This application has important implications for developing an alternative and more equitable tobacco prevention strategy that minimizes rather than exacerbates health inequities for LGBT adults. Moreover, this project is situated within a broader public health framework that investigates reasons for unresponsiveness and/or resistance to social norming policies among marginalized minority groups. Findings from this study may have important implications for other types of public health policies as well as implications for researching the persistence of smoking among other minority groups.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will consider the potential unintended consequences of tobacco denormalization strategies for LGBT adults in California. In particular, we will examine the processes of stigmatization as they relate to tobacco denormalization, tobacco use, and sexual and gender identities. Results from this project will shed light on why tobacco denormalization strategies are less effective for LGBT adults as well as to conceptualize and develop alternative approaches that may be more effective for reducing the prevalence of smoking among LGBT adults.            ",LGBT Adults and Tobacco Stigma: A Qualitative Study,8959299,R01CA190238,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Attitude ', ' Belief ', ' California ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Feedback ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Interview ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Identity ', ' Social Identification ', ' Societies ', ' Stigmatization ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Woman ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policies ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' Smoker ', ' Consensus ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' behavior change ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' meetings ', ' transsexual ', ' transgender ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Smoking Status ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' tobacco control ', ' tobacco use prevention ', ' prevent tobacco use ', ' tobacco prevention ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' public health relevance ', ' LGBTI ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex ', ' ']",NCI,PACIFIC INSTITUTE FOR RES AND EVALUATION,R01,2015,392409,0.16029002379011903
"Web-based Smoking Cessation Program for Tribal College Students DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  American Indian tribal college students have the highest smoking rates of any racial/ethnic group in the young adult population and also are disproportionately burdened by smoking-related morbidity and mortality. There are very few effective culturally-tailored smoking cessation programs for AI smokers. Our research group has worked with the American Indian community for the past 8 years to develop a culturally-tailored smoking cessation program (All Nations Breath of Life - ANBL), for AI adult smokers. All Nations Breath of Life was developed using the community-based participatory research approach and is an in-person group based program that incorporates cultural issues throughout the program. We have produced 30% cessation rates at 6-month follow-up with adult American Indian smokers from tribes and nations in the Midwest. Due to limited studies with the tribal college population, we have already conducted a cross-sectional internet-based survey to collect information on their smoking behaviors as well as other health behaviors. This research experience and strong collaboration with the AI community leaves us well poised to adapt the ANBL program for the tribal college smoking population. However, this current program needs substantial modifications to meet the unique needs of the tribal college student population. It recognizes the sacred role of tobacco among many American Indians and how culture affects smoking cessation among AIs, while still addressing recreational smoking. However, preliminary data from our recent studies indicate that the internet may be more favorable and appropriate delivery method for reaching this younger and more mobile tribal college population due to the web interactivity, immediacy of feedback, and wide reach and accessibility. This current proposal reflects a natural progression to addressing the significant problem of smoking among tribal college students using our successful methods. In this study, we will adapt and test a culturally tailored internet-based smoking cessation (I-ANBL) program based on ANBL, which was developed through CBPR methods. For the current proposal, we will conduct an individual randomized controlled trial (N=242) to test the effectiveness of an internet-based culturally-tailored smoking cessation program (I-ANBL) in a tribal college student population. Data will be collected at baseline, 3 months and 6 months using salivary cotinine, as well as comprehensive set of environmental and psychosocial measures. We hypothesize that AI tribal college students randomized to the culturally-tailored smoking cessation internet arm (I-ANBL) will have significantly higher continuous abstinence rates at 6 months than those receiving the heart healthy diet intervention (I-FV), focusing on increasing fruit and vegetable consumption. We will also examine the costs of delivering the tailored intervention program and potential mediators and moderators of the intervention-cessation relationship. Such a high-reach, low-cost strategy for promoting smoking cessation in this at-risk and underserved population could have great potential for adoption on a larger scale and thus help reduce existing health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  American Indians (AI) have the highest rates of cigarette smoking of any major racial/ethnic group in the US, approaching 40% to 50%. Despite the overall decline in adult smoking prevalence during the past several decades, the young adult (18-29 year olds) age group has the highest prevalence of smoking. We will conduct a randomized trial to test the effectiveness of an internet-based culturally-tailored smoking cessation program among tribal college students.",Web-based Smoking Cessation Program for Tribal College Students,8826080,R01CA174481,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Alien ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Conceptions ', ' Scotine ', ' 2-Pyrrolidinone, 1-methyl-5-(3-pyridinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Cotinine ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Feedback ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart ', ' Marketing ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Tribes ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' enhancing factor ', ' base ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Smoker ', ' Life ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' programs ', ' Salivary ', ' Healthy diet ', ' good diet ', ' psychosocial ', ' meetings ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' high school ', ' intervention program ', ' Cigarette ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' high school senior ', ' 12th grade ', ' twelfth grade ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Reporting ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' tribal university ', ' tribal college ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2015,565964,0.21361444884608607
"Smoking Prevention: A Graphic Novel Approach for Urban Minority Adolescents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is a leading cause of preventable disease in the U.S., and contributes to more than 440,000 (or nearly one of five) deaths each year. [1,2] More deaths are caused by complications from smoking than by the combined death totals from the human immunodeficiency virus, car crashes, illegal drug use, alcohol use, suicides, and murders.[1] Of particular concern is the U.S. epidemiological evidence showing that preventable deaths affect almost twice as many minority adults than their White counterparts.[9] Research is calling for culturally targeted smoking interventions for minority youth that meet ethnic/cultural experiences, needs, and values. The proposed project meets needs stated in the ""Innovation for Health Living"" grant announcement from the National Institute for Minority Health and Health Disparities for ...""culturally attuned behavioral interventions...that empower and promote opportunities for individuals to avoid risky behaviors""; and creating ""culturally appropriate, evidence-based ...educational media such as...printed materials for health disparities populations and disadvantaged communities."" The project targets the need to ""reduce health disparities within and across the priority areas of cardiovascular disease, stroke...and conditions of public health importance."" During Phase I, Terra Nova will work with smoking prevention, literary, cultural, and communication experts and an advisory panel of urban, minority adolescents to research and design a complete prototype Graphic Novel with a story focused on smoking prevention and health information and will feature a group of characters in a virtual urban setting that resonate with the target population (minority youth 12-14 yrs.). The story will be developed with input from inner city youth, and written to the group most vulnerable to smoking initiation - inner city minority teens living in low socio economic communities. The novel's anti-smoking message will be extended by online mentor materials, designed for use by youth mentors/group leaders through individual, group, and outreach activities. Project materials will be developed with input from a youth advisory committee, evaluated by expert consultants; and field-tested with 60 inner city minority adolescents for outcomes of future smoking intention, perceived risks/benefits of smoking, and confidence in smoking refusal skills. Through Smoking Prevention: A Graphic Novel Approach for Urban Minority Adolescents, Terra Nova seeks to reach and engage at- risk adolescents in a new and innovative way.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By creating an anti-smoking message specifically targeting minority youth delivered through a literature format popular with adolescents (the graphic novel), the proposed, Smoking Prevention: A Graphic Novel Approach for Urban Minority Adolescents will provide important health information to groups of youth that may not be reached by more general anti-smoking programs currently used in schools and communities. Students can relate to the group of characters introduced in an engaging graphic novel story who navigate pressures to smoke within the context of dynamic environmental pressures. The project is designed to help increase confidence in smoking refusal skills and anti-smoking outcomes of minority youth, thereby addressing the numbers of preventable deaths in this country from heart disease and stroke, more than half of which occur in minority adults.                ",Smoking Prevention: A Graphic Novel Approach for Urban Minority Adolescents,9001115,R43MD010342,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Books ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Institutes ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' pressure ', ' Printing ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Students ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Murder ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Intention ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Evaluation ', ' teacher ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Summary Reports ', ' Development Plans ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Companions ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Country ', ' meetings ', ' inner city ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' social ', ' risk perception ', ' response ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Reader ', ' anti-smoking ', ' Antismoking ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Smoking Prevention ', ' Smoking and Health ', ' Smoking and Health Research ', ' Preparation ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' minority health ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' fourteen year old ', ' age 14 years ', ' 14 year old ', ' user-friendly ', ' non-smoking ', ' smoking intervention ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NIMHD,TERRA NOVA LEARNING SYSTEMS,R43,2015,142466,0.0638612731513735
"Contingency Management for Smoking Cessation in Pregnant Minority Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to reduce tobacco-related disparities in maternal and infant health outcomes by improving smoking cessation and relapse prevention interventions for minority pregnant and postpartum women, who have been significantly underrepresented in smoking cessation research. This study will examine the feasibility and efficacy of a prize-based contingency management approach for increasing smoking cessation and preventing relapse among socioeconomically disadvantaged minority pregnant smokers. First, the intervention will be pretested with 10 pregnant low-income minority smokers and then refined based on acceptability survey and focus group data. Next, a pilot study will be conducted. 60 highly disadvantaged minority women, recruited from the outpatient obstetric clinics at a large teaching hospital, who report daily smoking and who meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., 18 years or older; < 28 weeks gestational age) will be enrolled ad randomized to one of two study conditions: 1) Standard Psychoeducational Intervention (6- week, individually-administered, pregnancy-specific Quit Smoking Now curriculum, as currently implemented in the clinic; QSN-SP); 2) Standard Psychoeducational Intervention plus Contingency Management (provision of incentives contingent on biochemically-verified abstinence; QSN-CM). Abstinence monitoring via expired carbon monoxide and salivary continues levels will occur in both groups beginning on the first quit day and continuing through 3-months postpartum. Only participants in the QSN-CM group will be reinforced for biochemically-verified abstinence with chances to win prizes ranging in value from approximately $1 to $100 ('fishbowl' or 'prize bowl' method). Primary study outcomes include: intervention attendance and completion; and continuous, prolonged and point prevalence tobacco abstinence (self-report with biochemical verification). Secondary outcomes include: maternal and infant health outcomes (e.g., gestational age; infant birth weight, length and head circumference; delivery/neonatal complications; infant growth and respiratory health). The study will also examine factors (e.g., depression, stress) influencing treatment response. Outcomes will be assessed through follow-up research exams (delivery and 6-months postpartum) and hospital chart reviews. Results should advance scientific knowledge regarding effective methods for promoting and maintaining smoking abstinence among pregnant disadvantaged women and provide preliminary feasibility and efficacy data needed to support a larger randomized controlled trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prenatal smoking has been associated with numerous adverse pregnancy and delivery complications. Socioeconomically disadvantaged, minority women are less likely to quit smoking, are more likely to relapse after cessation and may suffer greater health consequences, for themselves and their baby, as a result of smoking. The proposed project seeks to reduce disparities in tobacco-related maternal and infant health outcomes by improving smoking cessation and relapse prevention interventions for low-income, minority

"Evaluating racial and ethnic disparities in the success of national health care efforts to promote smoking cessation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There have been multiple attempts in the U.S. to close the gap in the quality of health care for diverse racial and ethnic subpopulations. In 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services launched the Healthy People 2020 plan. Two of four main goals of the plan are decreasing racial and ethnic health disparities and attaining high-quality lives free of preventable diseases. Because of this and other programs, a number of improvements in health care have been made that should help reduce health disparities in the U.S. Despite these efforts, some racial/ethnic minority groups still have considerably higher mortality rates from cancer and other smoking-caused conditions and diseases than Non-Hispanic (NH) White people. In addition, there are limited research findings regarding public awareness, efficacy and availability of smoking cessation methods for racial/ethnic minorities. The overall goals of the proposed study are to determine the quality of smoking- cessation-related (SCR) health care for diverse racial and ethnic groups, over-time changes in the quality of the SCR health care, and smokers' awareness and attitudes regarding currently available smoking cessation methods and treatments, as well as identify methods that have been used to successfully quit smoking. The primary investigation will focus on assessing potential differences with respect to each of these factors across the largest racial/ethnic U.S. subpopulations (i.e., NH White, NH Black/African American, and Hispanic); the secondary investigation will concern smaller U.S. subpopulations: NH American Indian/Alaska Native, NH Asian, and NH Multiracial. The necessity of differentiating between relatively large and small subpopulations is confirmed by the preliminary research findings. The data from the Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) will be used. The TUS-CPS is the key source of data on smoking behaviors among diverse racial/ethnic groups, including small U.S. subpopulations. The proposed research is innovative because it is the first study to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of smoking cessation efforts across diverse racial/ethnic groups using a representative sample of the adult U.S. population and the first to examine longitudinal changes in the quality of the SCR health care services, as well as differences in the SCR health care services offered to diverse racial/ethnic minorities and non-minorities. Results of the proposed study are expected to play a vital role in improving the health care system as a whole, helping to close the gap in the quality of health care services offered to racial/ethnic minorities and non-minorities, and further decreasing rates of smoking-caused conditions and diseases across all subpopulations. The research findings will be beneficial for further refining smoking cessation programs for diverse subpopulations of smokers, increasing awareness of available smoking cessation interventions and medical treatments, and reducing smoking prevalence and rates of smoking-caused diseases and conditions, especially in underserved Americans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The study will determine the quality of smoking-cessation-related (SCR) health care for diverse racial and ethnic groups, over-time changes in the quality of the SCR health care, and smoker's awareness and attitudes regarding currently available smoking cessation methods (including medical treatments), as well as which methods have been used to successfully quit smoking. Potential discrepancies with respect to each of these factors will be assessed across diverse racial/ethnic U.S. subpopulations.

"Innovation for Smoke-Free Homes: Real-Time Feedback DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) is a significant health risk, especially to young children. More than 50 percent of children's SHSe occurs at home and children in low-income households are more likely to be exposed to SHS. Thus, home-based interventions are needed to protect children from SHSe. This is the first efficacy study to test whether children's home SHSe can be reduced by using innovative SHS particle monitors to provide real-time feedback to household residents plus brief advice/praise. This study will test the efficacy of immediate feedback and brief advice/praise on low-income families' ability to reduce children's exposure to nicotine, as measured by cotinine assays, reduce smoking in the home, and establish home smoking bans. Learning theory and pilot data suggest that real-time feedback from the monitor plus brief advice will prompt and reinforce SHSe reduction behaviors. Four hundred families from Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) programs in San Diego, California will be recruited. Households will be randomly assigned to an experimental group that receives continuous real-time feedback from a SHS particle monitor plus feedback-related brief advice/praise to reduce their child's exposure, or to a usual care control group where the particle monitor delivers no feedback. During the intervention phase, monitors in households of the experimental group will produce warning lights and beeps when SHS is detected. The primary specific aims are to: 1) Determine the differential group change in SHSe levels, as measured by child cotinine assays, due to real-time monitor feedback and brief advice; 2) Determine the differential group change in the establishment of home smoking bans; and 3) Validate differential change in particle measures of SHSe using nicotine dosimeters and child urine cotinine assays. The exploratory aims are to: determine theoretical moderators (e.g., child's health) of the effect of brief advice plus feedback; assess the effects of theoretical mediators (e.g., establishment of home smoking bans and other social contingencies) of change in SHSe; explore the dynamic nature of SHSe by examining the continuous particle monitor records over months to identify social contexts and micro- environments in the home as precise targets for intervention (e.g., smoking location, nonsmoker locations, and social interactions while smoking); assess the differential changes in tobacco use and SHSe by racial/ethnic group and by single v two-parent families to increase understanding of disparities for tobacco control; and obtain suggestions from families to enhance future use of the monitors. This is also the first large-scale test of a new technology in residential tobacco control, where real-time and telemetry feedback to investigators will both enable immediate feedback from light and sound alerts to families and inform investigators of smoking events or reduction in smoking events that warrant advice or praise. Thus, this application opens a new direction for future innovative studies using novel technology to advance reduction of SHSe in a range of micro-environments. Secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) is a significant health hazard for adults and children, especially the medically vulnerable. There is no risk-free level of SHSe and cumulative exposure can lead to pulmonary diseases and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Millions of U.S. children are exposed at home. This is the first study to test an innovative particle monitor to provide real-time feedback (lights/sounds) to encourage parents to reduce young children's SHSe in their home.",Innovation for Smoke-Free Homes: Real-Time Feedback,8839288,R01HL103684,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Behavior ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' California ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Control Groups ', ' Scotine ', ' 2-Pyrrolidinone, 1-methyl-5-(3-pyridinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Cotinine ', ' Counseling ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Infant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' lung disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Motivation ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Nicotine ', ' Parents ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Records ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Reinforcement (Psychology) ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Social Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Interaction ', ' sound ', ' Sudden Unexpected Infant Death ', ' Sudden Infant Death ', ' SIDS ', ' Crib Death ', ' Cot Death ', ' Sudden infant death syndrome ', ' Suggestion ', ' Technology ', ' Telemetries ', ' Telemetry ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Health Hazards ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Consumer Preferences ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' nonsmoker ', ' Non-smoker ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' particle ', ' preteen ', ' preadolescence ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' secondhand smoke ', ' second hand smoke ', ' environmental tobacco smoke exposure ', ' Environmental Tobacco Smoke ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Dose ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Study Section ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Clinical Services ', ' tobacco control ', ' Instruction ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' group intervention ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' efficacy testing ', ' brief advice ', ' ']",NHLBI,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,1211212,0.10339502816686306
"Implementing tobacco use treatment guidelines in dental public health clinics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. The 2008 Public Health Service Guideline (PHS), Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence provides strong evidence that brief advice combined with assistance such as counseling and pharmacotherapy, can significantly increase quit rates. Unfortunately, provider adherence to Guideline recommendations is poor. Inadequate implementation of the Guideline in practice settings, particularly those serving ethnic minorities and other vulnerable populations, has contributed to growing disparities in smoking prevalence and tobacco-related illness. This proposal addresses this research-to-practice gap by examining the effectiveness of three practical and highly replicable strategies for implementing evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of tobacco dependence in dental public health clinics. Dental providers have a credible and central role in providing tobacco cessation services. The majority of smokers see a dentist annually and tobacco use is a known risk factor for oral disease. Moreover, controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy and effectiveness of dental office-based cessation interventions. Yet dental care settings remain a relatively untapped venue for the treatment of tobacco dependence. In order to integrate evidence-based tobacco cessation treatment into routine dental practice, optimal implementation processes and strategies must be identified. We propose a 3-arm, cluster randomized controlled trial that will 1) Compare the effectiveness and cost of three promising strategies for implementation of the PHS tobacco use treatment guidelines: a) Staff training and current best practices (CBP); 2) CBP + provider performance feedback (PF) and 3) CBP + PF + provider reimbursement for delivery of tobacco cessation treatment (pay for performance) on provider adherence to recommended guidelines for tobacco use treatment; 2) Use a mixed-methods approach to examine potential theory-driven mechanisms at the organizational and provider level hypothesized to explain the comparative effectiveness of three strategies for implementation; and 3) Identify baseline organizational factors that influence the implementation of evidence-based tobacco use treatment practices in dental clinics. The trial will be conducted in 18 public dental care clinics and information about implementation outcomes and processes will be derived from multiple data sources (patient exit interviews, provider surveys and semi- structured interviews). Guided by a conceptual framework that emphasizes provider beliefs and organizational characteristics, we will identify factors that influence the implementation process in dental clinics. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to provide critical new knowledge to facilitate the widespread adoption, implementation, dissemination and sustained utilization of evidence-based tobacco use treatment strategies in dental practices across the U.S. ",Implementing tobacco use treatment guidelines in dental public health clinics,8838735,R01CA162035,"['Adoption ', ' Belief ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Sources ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Clinics ', ' Dental Offices ', ' Dentists ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Feedback ', ' Dental General Practice ', ' dental practice ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoking ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Tobacco ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' United States ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' Reminder Systems ', ' Process Measure ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Structure ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' effectiveness research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' provider intervention ', ' research into practice ', ' research to practice ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' financial incentive ', ' brief advice ', ' arm ', ' ']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2015,720904,0.08077871866484744
"LGBT Adults and Tobacco Stigma: A Qualitative Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary focus of this proposed study is to consider the potential unintended consequences of tobacco denormalization strategies for LGBT adults. In particular, we will examine the processes of stigmatization as they relate to tobacco denormalization, tobacco use, and sexual and gender identities. This project expands our research portfolio on tobacco-related stigma. Currently we are funded to examine perceptions of tobacco denormalization among African American young adults in California. We will address the following aims: 1. Understand perceptions of tobacco denormalization strategies and related beliefs and attitudes about the stigmatization of tobacco among LGBT smokers and former smokers in California; 2. Examine the ways in which the stigmatization of tobacco use may intersect with sexual and gender identity stigmas; 3. Explore alternative strategies that may be more effective in reducing the prevalence of smoking among  LGBT adults in California. This study includes 2 phases. In Phase 1, we will conduct asynchronous online group interviews in 10 forums where LGBT adults meet and engage online. Phase 2 will consist of 240 in-depth qualitative interviews conducted with LGBT adults who live in California. The sample will be stratified by sexual/gender identity status, smoking status (current smoker/former smoker), and age (young adults/adults) with 15 participants included in each cell. Complementing online group interviews with in-person individual interviews will help to reveal group norms and beliefs as well as the plurality of beliefs within the group to yield a more holistic understanding of study aims. Using a pattern-level approach to the analysis of the narrative data from phases 1 and 2, we will investigate the processes of tobacco-related stigmatization and its relationship to tobacco denormalization for LGBT adults, as well as how the overlapping stigmas of other social identities may shape the experience of tobacco-related stigma for LGBT adults. Results from the study will be disseminated through traditional conference presentations and academic journal publications, as well as through a project website that includes an accessible presentation of study findings and a social media forum to solicit feedback from study participants and people concerned about the high prevalence of smoking among LGBT adults. This application has important implications for developing an alternative and more equitable tobacco prevention strategy that minimizes rather than exacerbates health inequities for LGBT adults. Moreover, this project is situated within a broader public health framework that investigates reasons for unresponsiveness and/or resistance to social norming policies among marginalized minority groups. Findings from this study may have important implications for other types of public health policies as well as implications for researching the persistence of smoking among other minority groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will consider the potential unintended consequences of tobacco denormalization strategies for LGBT adults in California. In particular, we will examine the processes of stigmatization as they relate to tobacco denormalization, tobacco use, and sexual and gender identities.

"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities among African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 African American smokers attempting to quit.            ",Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities among African American Smokers,9009132,R01MD010362,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' Maps ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Poverty ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Letters ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' interest ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' demographics ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' mindfulness ', ' distress tolerance ', ' social health determinants ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' built environment ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' data to knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' ']",NIMHD,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,791875,0.2244692431251016
"A Family-Focused Intervention for Asian American Male Smokers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Family-Focused Intervention for Asian American Male Smokers Smoking prevalence remains high in subgroups of Asian American men, particularly among those with low English proficiency (LEP) and immigrants from cultures where smoking prevalence is high, including Chinese and Vietnamese. The 2011-12 California Health Interview Survey estimates that nearly half (46%) of all Asian male smokers in California are either Chinese or Vietnamese. The smoking prevalence's among LEP Chinese and Vietnamese men were 32% and 43%, respectively, compared to 16% of the general California male population. We developed a family-focused intervention utilizing lay health worker (LWH) outreach that integrates formative qualitative research and selected constructs from Social Network Theory, Social Cognitive Theory, and the Trans-theoretical Model. The intervention involves 2 small group education sessions with dyads of smokers and family members, and 2 follow-up individual telephone calls delivered by LHWs over 2 months. Our single-group pilot trial with 96 dyads of Chinese and Vietnamese male daily smokers and their family members showed a high feasibility of recruiting unmotivated smokers (42% were at ""precontemplation""), and a promising 7-day point prevalence abstinence rate of 30% at 3 months with independent corroboration from family members. The first aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the family-focused intervention in promoting smoking cessation in Chinese and Vietnamese male smokers. The second aim is to explore mediators to identify key psychosocial and behavioral processes that underlie how the intervention affects the processes of quitting and maintaining abstinence. We will conduct a 2-arm cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with assessments at baseline, 6 and 12 months following intervention initiation. The RCT involves 60 lay health workers (LHWs); each recruits and delivers interventions to 6 dyads of one male daily smoker and one family member from his household, for a total 360 smoker-family dyads. Half of the LHWs, stratified by Asian subgroup and smoking history, will be randomized to the family-focused intervention group and the other half will be assigned to an attention control condition receiving education on healthy eating. All participants will receive written information on smoking cessation resources. We hypothesize that, at 6 and 12 month follow-up, the intervention smokers will be more likely to achieve biochemically verified smoking abstinence (7-day point prevalence), to report having made at least one 24-hour quit attempt, and to report using at least one evidence-based smoking cessation resource (quitline, medication, health professional advice) than smokers in the control condition. Using prospective quantitative data obtained from the RCT, and post-trial dyadic and individual interviews of 30 smokers and 30 family members selected based on abstinence experiences, we will explore mediators at individual, family and social network levels that explain how the intervention affects quitting and maintaining abstinence. The long-term goal is to understand effective ways to utilize family-based and social outreach strategies to reduce tobacco use disparities in hard-to-reach populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will examine the use of an innovative strategy that involves lay health worker outreach to mobilize smokers and their families to promote smoking cessation in Chinese and Vietnamese American men. This project will yield a significant public health impact as it addresses gaps in knowledge about effective strategies for treating tobacco dependence in underrepresented populations where smoking prevalence is disproportionately high such as among Chinese and Vietnamese American men.",A Family-Focused Intervention for Asian American Male Smokers,9084528,R01DA036749,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Attention ', ' California ', ' Chinese American ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Household and Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Household ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Smoking ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' Writing ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Family member ', ' Social Network ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Immigrant ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Staging ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Smoking History ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' post intervention ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' pilot trial ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' Network-based ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' evidence base ', ' FDA approved ', ' group intervention ', ' population based ', ' arm ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' ']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,648439,0.20319047704545187
"Understanding Disparities in Quitting in African American and White Smokers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial/ethnic differences in smoking are well documented; African Americans smoke fewer cigarettes per day than Whites but experience disproportionately greater smoking attributable morbidity and mortality. Well documented disparities also exist in smoking cessation with African Americans consistently quitting at lower rates than Whites. However, to-date, no adequately powered study, stratified on race, has been conducted to confirm this finding using a rigorous study design or to understand the mechanisms accounting for differential quit rates in African Americans relative to Whites. The objectives of this application are to 1) describe the differences in smoking cessation among AA and White smokers treated with varenicline, 2) identify the smoking, psychosocial, treatment process, and biological factors that independently explain the relationship between race/ethnicity and cotinine-verified 7-day abstinence in African American and White smokers, and 3) examine the side effect profile of varenicline by smoking level. These aims will be accomplished through a prospective cohort intervention study, stratified on race, age (< 40, > 40), and gender among 448 participants (224 African American, 224 White). All participants will receive 3 months of varenicline, the most effective of currently available smoking cessation medications, standard educational materials, and six sessions of smoking cessation counseling. This study is innovative. It will be the first known study to report on the use of varenicline in As, the first to examine varenicline in light smokers (<10 cpd) and among a wide range of smoking levels (3-20 cpd), the first head-to-head study, stratified on race, designed to prospectively compare pharmacotherapy in AAs versus Whites, and one of a few to explore mechanisms underlying disparities in quitting between AA and White smokers. The impact of these findings will be considerable, having ramifications for treatment, clinical practice, and policy. Significan knowledge will be gained about African American-White differences in quitting. Findings have the potential to improve tobacco use treatment by moving the field away from a generic focus on race/ethnicity toward a targeted focus on modifiable smoking, psychosocial, and treatment process factors most relevant to African Americans and to Whites. African Americans smoking fewer cigarettes per day and experience greater smoking-related disease and death, yet consistently quit smoking at lower rates than Whites.

"Development of a Telephone-Based Individual Smoking Cessation Program for American Indians ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians (AI) have the highest rates of smoking of any racial/ethnic group in the United States (41% versus 23% for whites and blacks). Consequently, they suffer the highest mortality from tobacco-related illnesses of any racial/ethnic group; two of every five AI die from a tobacco-related illness. Despite the abysmal rates of smoking and tobacco-related illness among AI, few researchers have addressed this important issue, in part because tobacco is a sacred plant to many AI and, as such, cannot be treated completely negatively, as most smoking cessation programs do. Researchers at the University of Kansas Medical Center, Center for American Indian Community Health have been using community-based participatory research (CBPR) to address recreational tobacco use in the AI community since 2003 and have developed a successful culturally-tailored smoking cessation program, All Nations Breath of Life (ANBL), that respects tobacco as a sacred plant and promotes honoring it rather than abusing it recreationally. Our in- person program currently has quit rates of 31% at 6-months post-baseline (P<0.001 compared to the best previously reported program for a multi-tribal population). Though we have experienced success through an intensive, in-person program, we are unable to reach the entire AI community with this program. Therefore, we propose the development and pilot testing of a telephone-based program with an accompanying interactive website to reach a larger AI population. We will address the following specific aims: (1) To develop an individual telephone-based version of ANBL and accompanying interactive website; (2) To conduct a formative test of the program (N=10) to determine modifications needed for the pilot; and (3) To pilot test tANBL in 80 AI smokers and estimate effect size of the intervention. Our primary endpoint will be 30-day point prevalence abstinence from recreational smoking biochemically verified by salivary cotinine level at 6 months post- baseline. We hypothesize that quit rates in tANBL will be significantly better than those currently reported in the literature for AI in untailored programs (30% versus 10%). We will address the following secondary aims: (1) To maximize and assess the cultural relevance of the intervention program and all of its components; (2) To examine the acceptability and feasibility of implementing an individual telephone-based ANBL; (3) To examine reasons for relapse among those smokers who were quit at 12 weeks and relapsed at 6 months; (4) To examine continuous abstinence rates for tANBL; and (5) To examine reduction in cigarettes per day among non-quitters.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: American Indians suffer greater tobacco-related health disparities than any other ethnic group in the United States due to their high rates of smoking. By targeting tobacco use, this project addresses both the leading cause of cancer death and the overall leading cause of death among American Indians through the implementation and testing of an individual telephone-based, culturally tailored smoking cessation program based on our successful All Nations Breath of Life in-person, group-based program. If successful, this project has the potential to greatly reduce cigarette smoking and the resulting negative health outcomes among American Indians by reaching a greater number of smokers than our in-person program.        ",Development of a Telephone-Based Individual Smoking Cessation Program for American Indians,9127547,R21CA203568,"['American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Scotine ', ' Cotinine ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Kansas ', ' Literature ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Missouri ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Plants ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoking ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Biochemical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Letters ', ' Smoker ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Salivary ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Sanctity of Life ', ' Respect for Life ', ' Life Sanctities ', ' Value of Life ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' intervention program ', ' Cigarette ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Reporting ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Qualifying ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Smoking Status ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' tobacco control ', ' urban American Indian ', ' urban native american ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Abstinence ', ' community organizations ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' public health relevance ', ' arm ', ' education research ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2016,197055,0.1725946034621307
"RCT of An Internet Cessation Program Plus Online Social Network for HIV + Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are 1.1 million persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the US: 60% smoke cigarettes and 75% are interested in quitting. Two-thirds of PLWH use the Internet, making this a promising avenue to deliver smoking cessation treatment. Almost none are currently accessing smoking cessation interventions designed to meet their specific needs and concerns. Cigarette smoking is responsible for 24%--61% of deaths among PLWH, and 30% of non-AIDS defining malignancies. It is driving the alarming rise in lung cancers in this highly vulnerable population. The lack of access to proven, effective, culturally appropriate tobacco cessation services represents a health disparity of the first order.  Cessation websites offer smokers convenience, low (or no) cost, and anonymity; however, there are no publicly available web-based cessation programs specifically designed for PLWH smokers. Smokers living with HIV have high rates of nicotine dependence, anxiety, depression, loneliness, and substance use. We developed Positively Smoke Free on the Web (PSFW), a theory-driven, culturally tailored web-based program designed to address the specific needs of PLWH smokers. Our NCI-funded R21 pilot of PSFW demonstrated moderate-high levels of adherence and yielded higher 3-month abstinence rates compared to standard care (10% vs. 4%). Our prior research on web-based cessation interventions has shown that smokers who participate in an online community - whether passively reading posts by others or actively engaging in online discussions - are more than twice as likely to achieve abstinence even after controlling for a broad range of covariates. In preparation for the proposed study, our partners at the American Legacy Foundation have enhanced and modernized PSFW by integrating an online community platform (now ""PSFW+""), developing a training protocol for PLWH smoker seed users (to provide a critical mass of social network participants), and recruiting and training 11 PLWH smokers for this role. The prototype PSFW+ application has been successfully alpha- and beta-tested in anticipation of the randomized controlled trial.  We propose a study that will compare the efficacy of the PSFW+ smoking cessation website to an attention- matched website promoting cardiovascular health in a randomized controlled trial with repeated measures at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months. Participants will be N=550 PLWH smokers interested in quitting in the next 30 days. All participants will be offered nicotine replacement therapy. It is hypothesized that PSFW+ will outperform the control condition on the primary outcome of 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 months post-randomization. Secondary aims and exploratory analyses will examine theory-driven hypotheses about the mediators and moderators of treatment outcome (e.g., depression, anxiety, social support, loneliness, self-efficacy). Establishing the effectiveness of a web-based smoking cessation program for PLWH that has broad reach and could be scaled to reach PLWH smokers throughout the US would not only represent an enormous advance in the fight against tobacco use in PLWH, but would also provide a clearer understanding of the role of targeted, web-based health interventions in comprehensive HIV care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Smoking rates among persons living with HIV (PLWH) are triple those in the general adult population in the US, and there are few, if any, cessation resources available that address their particular needs. This study will examine the efficacy of a web-based smoking cessation program and online social network specifically developed for PLWH. As one of the first studies of its kind, the proposed research will yield important insights into an intervention approach that could be scaled nationally to reach PLWH smokers throughout the US.

"Defining the urban-rural continuum and distinguishing rural differences to prevent tobacco use ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substantial health disparities exist between rural and urban regions of the US. Adults in rural areas have among the highest smoking rates in the country: consuming more cigarettes and using more smokeless/spit tobacco when compared to their urban counterparts. Rural populations have worse health outcomes and lower cancer survival rates and have been historically underserved by tobacco control programs, lack access to prevention and cessation services and are less likely to have implemented protective tobacco control policies. In addition, rural areas have been treated as homogenous and the differences among these divergent areas have not been adequately researched. A further complication for research is the lack of a consistent definition of what is meant as rural so there are multiple measures of the urban-rural continuum. To assure that limited resources are appropriately targeting subgroups most at risk of smoking-related morbidity and mortality, we propose to develop an innovative methodology to define and measure this urban-rural continuum and apply this as a proof of concept to improve tobacco epidemiology and tobacco control research. Developing better measures will allow for a more comprehensive investigation of cancer risk factors that exist in rural regions. To accomplish this, we propose first to use the Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) at the individual level to develop and test an innovative methodology for urban-rural continuum measures. Second, we propose to use selected survey items from the TUS- CPS and link this data at the tract level to other Census data sets to investigate selected underlying factors that can identify specific rural differences. We will convene a panel of rural practitioners and academic experts to provide key stakeholder perspectives to validate and elucidate the findings. This innovative methodology will advance cancer research in an understudied topic and help explore differences in tobacco use across rural regions and populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rural residents face fewer tobacco control regulations than urban counterparts and rural tobacco use rates are significantly higher than urban rates, with direct linkages to poorer health outcomes. This project will examine government and methodological categorizations of rural isolation and apply the refined measures to improve the targeting of rural subgroups most at risk of smoking-related morbidity and mortality. Results will strengthen research methodology and inform public health campaigns and tobacco control policy and regulatory efforts, reducing the burden of tobacco-attributable diseases among rural populations.        ",Defining the urban-rural continuum and distinguishing rural differences to prevent tobacco use,9100596,R21CA205589,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Air ', ' Americas ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Behavior ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' Bladder ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Censuses ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Cervix ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' Spit Tobacco ', ' Chewing Tobacco ', ' Oral Tobacco ', ' Complication ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Esophagus ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' voice box ', ' Larynx Head and Neck ', ' Laryngeal ', ' Larynx ', ' Laws ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Pancreas ', ' Throat ', ' Pharynx ', ' Pharyngeal structure ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rural Population ', ' Smoking ', ' sound ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' oral cavity cancer ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' population survey ', ' rural area ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Health Campaign ', ' Link ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' cancer risk ', ' intervention program ', ' Cigarette ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' Prevention ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Regulation ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Smokeless ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Subgroup ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' Tobacco Control Research ', ' Tobacco Epidemiology ', ' Tobacco Use Epidemiology ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' tobacco control ', ' tobacco use prevention ', ' prevent tobacco use ', ' tobacco prevention ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' public health relevance ', ' cancer survival ', ' ']",NCI,NATIONAL OPINION RESEARCH CENTER,R21,2016,175200,0.0964631723456438
"Small Financial Incentives to Promote Smoking Cessation in Safety Net Hospital Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. Although the prevalence of smoking has declined to 18.1 percent among U.S. adults, 27.9 percent of those living in poverty report current smoking. Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking cessation. There is mounting evidence that offering incentives for abstinence (i.e., Contingency Management [CM]) may be an effective approach for promoting short-term smoking cessation, though few studies have demonstrated longer-term effectiveness. In addition, little attention has been paid to socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers specifically (e.g., safety- net hospital populations) in CM intervention studies. Our preliminary work indicates that offering small escalating financial incentives for smoking abstinence dramatically increases short-term cessation rates among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers when incentives are included as an adjunct to standard clinic- based smoking cessation treatment. However, additional work is needed to evaluate the influence of this CM approach in the longer-term with a rigorous and adequately powered trial. Thus, the aims of the proposed study are to: 1) evaluate the longer-term impact of an adjunctive, low-cost CM intervention (relative to usual care) on smoking abstinence rates among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals participating in a safety-net hospital smoking cessation program, and 2) identify treatment mechanisms and contextual factors associated with cessation outcomes among intervention participants using both traditional and ecological momentary assessment approaches. Participants seeking smoking cessation treatment at an urban safety net hospital (N = 320) will be randomly assigned to 1) usual care (UC; n = 160) or 2) UC plus financial incentives for biochemically-confirmed abstinence (CM; n = 160). Those randomized to the CM intervention will have the opportunity to earn small gift cards for biochemically-verified abstinence through 12 weeks post-quit. Specifically, participants may earn $20 for abstinence on the quit date, and this amount will increase by $5 with each successive abstinent visit through 4 weeks post-quit ($150 total). Participants may additionally earn $50 gift cards for abstinence at 8 and 12 weeks post-quit. Biochemically-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks post-quit (longer-term abstinence) will be the primary outcome variable, though smoking status will be assessed at all visits. We also hope to gain a better understanding of CM treatment mechanisms and to identify other factors that directly influence cessation via traditional questionnaire and smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment approaches. Smartphone technology allows for ""real-time"" data collection to more accurately capture important cessation-related variables, and will be used to deliver gain-framed messages to support and strengthen the CM intervention. Findings will provide insight about new treatment targets for intervention research, and will demonstrate an effective, inexpensive, and easily implementable means by which to improve longer-term smoking cessation rates among economically disadvantaged smokers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking cessation. Offering incentives for abstinence is an effective approach for promoting short-term smoking cessation, though the longer-term effectiveness of this approach has not been established and little attention has been paid to socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers.

"Impact of smoking and its cessation on systemic and airway immune activation PROJECT SUMMARY The exceedingly high rate of smoking and its substantial contribution to morbidity and mortality in the HIV- infected population despite effective ART makes smoking a major health risk in the HIV-infected population. The mechanism by which smoking exerts synergistic effects on HIV-induced immune dysfunction remains unclear. Our central hypothesis is that the persistent HIV-induced immune dysfunction leaves the lung exceeding vulnerable to further insults by smoking. Smoking further drives immune-mediate pathways, such as increase in oxidative stress and inflammation, to cause further local tissue destruction. The lung pathology can result in activation of latently infected alveolar macrophages in the lung to produce low level HIV viremia, and perpetuates this pro-inflammatory environment. Additionally, the chronic oxidative imbalance can cause not only local tissue damage but cellular DNA damage, which results in epithelial gene expression alterations. Aim 1 seeks to identify in a cross-sectional study of ART-treated HIV smokers chronic immune effects of smoking by evaluating for differences in cytokine profile and immune cell phenotype and ROS production of cells isolated in the airways and blood from HIV-infected never smokers. The relationships of these local and systemic immune perturbations with airway epithelial gene transcriptome and evidence of residual viremia will be evaluated to identify biological pathways by which smoking interacts with HIV immune dysfunction. In Aim 2 to further test the hypothesis we propose a proof-of-concept smoking cessation clinical study to assess the degree and nature of reversibility of lung damage among HIV smokers who achieve smoking cessation compared to those who continue to smoke. In this single site study, we will employ an intensive smoking cessation program to help study participants who are recruited from a large urban HIV-infected outpatient clinic where a unique integrated clinical research infrastructure is in place, achieve smoking cessation. Longitudinally samples will be collected pre-cessation and post-cessation from those who are able to achieve 10-week cessation from the lung and blood. We will evaluate the change in level of inflammation, immune activation and oxidative stress, and determine if these immune-mediate pathways are related to changes in HIV residual viremia and epithelial gene expression in the lung. Lastly, leveraging existing resources, we will compare these finding to those in uninfected smokers from banked samples collected already by our collaborator. This smoking cessation study in HIV-infected patients will be the first of its kind, with longitudinal specimen collection from both the lung and blood compartments, and utilizing translational approaches through collaborations with experts in virology, immunology, gene transcription and health disparity research. Understanding the relative contribution and pathways by which smoking interacts with immune activation and inflammation characteristic of chronic HIV disease will help guide development of therapeutic interventions to halt or reverse these pathological processes and ensuing clinical disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Smoking is a major and urgent public health issue for the HIV-infected population. Understanding the pathways by which smoking adversely interacts with HIV-induced immune dysfunction in the lung is critical to address this urgent public health concern.

"Project Impact: A Culturally-Tailored Adherence Intervention for Latino Smokers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2009, tobacco use was implicated in 438,000 deaths in the U.S. and over 80% of lung cancers were attributed to smoking. Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer death for Latino men and the second leading cause for Latina women. Several pharmacological treatments for smoking cessation have been shown to be effective at improving tobacco abstinence rates, including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Despite the availability of these efficacious treatments, adherence to treatment is a significant barrier for Latinos. Developing novel, effective and culturally targeted interventions that increase NRT adherence among Latinos can ultimately inform clinical practice and improve the cessation rates of Latino smokers seeking to quit. The current study seeks to develop and test a culturally tailored medication adherence intervention that will include text messaging and behavioral components that target the unique needs of Latino smokers. These novel and targeted components will address misperceptions and barriers related to NRT treatment and offer real-time reminders and informational prompts to enhance adherence. In the initial development phase of the research, qualitative methods will be used to develop the Latino-targeted components of the intervention. During the clinical trial phase of the study, 98 Latino smokers interested in quitting will be randomized to one of two groups - Culturally Tailored Adherence (CTA), or 2) Standard Medication Management (SMM). All participants will receive 12 weeks of NRT and will receive ongoing assessments of NRT adherence, tobacco abstinence, and will be assessed on the constructs of our theoretical model (e.g. motivation or behavioral skills). The proposed study will be conducted in the context of a five-year career development program that will provide advanced training in Latino smoking cessation and health, qualitative methods, adherence interventions, tobacco addiction and cessation, and the use of technology in healthcare. The proposed training and research plans aim to promote the applicant's long-term career goal of establishing an independently-funded program of tobacco research with a focus on Latino populations. A comprehensive training plan is proposed, combining mentored research, structured mentorship activities guided by established researchers in the field, formal coursework and workshops, and participation in seminars at Brown University and Butler Hospital. Considering the high rates of non-adherence among Latino smokers involved in smoking cessation treatment, the proposed study addresses several public health concerns related to smoking cessation, cancer, and health disparities among Latinos. We seek to develop and test a culturally tailored intervention that aims to increase adherence to nicotine replacement therapy among Latino smokers. The results of the proposed study can have a beneficial effect on improving cessation rates among this vulnerable subpopulation and ultimately decrease the risks of developing tobacco-related diseases and illnesses.",Project Impact: A Culturally-Tailored Adherence Intervention for Latino Smokers,9120809,K01CA160670,"['neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Elements ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hospitals ', ' Language ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Motivation ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Smoking ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Medication Management ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Smoker ', ' programs ', ' treatment days ', ' Treatment Period ', ' treatment duration ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' interest ', ' skills training ', ' experience ', ' self help ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' cultural values ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' therapy adherence ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Adherence ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Pharmacological Treatment ', ' Smoking and Health ', ' Smoking and Health Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' tobacco abstinence ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Abstinence ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' treatment adherence ', ' clinical practice ', ' Regimen ', ' behavioral construct ', ' behavior construct ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K01,2016,140238,0.11278210047544228
"Development of a Tobacco Health Literacy Instrument ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians (AI) have the highest rates of smoking of any racial/ethnic group in the US (41% versus 23% for whites and blacks). Consequently, they suffer the highest mortality from tobacco-related illnesses of any racial/ethnic group; two of every five AI die from a tobacco-related illness. AI youth have a high prevalence of tobacco use as well, where cigarette smoking is reported just below 37% for youth aged 11-18. Tobacco prevention efforts include education materials and programming that deter individuals from starting smoking or encourage individuals to quit smoking. However, we do not know if education efforts are fully understood and resonate with target populations, as indicated by high prevalence rates among AI populations. This may be explained, in part, because tobacco is a sacred plant to many AI and, as such, cannot be treated completely negatively, as most primary and secondary prevention programs do. We propose to create health literacy (HL) instrument that is specific to tobacco knowledge and risk. We believe this is a necessary step in primary and secondary prevention efforts in order to determine the appropriate way to intervene upon behaviors among those who have yet to start smoking, those who smoke and want to quit, and those that smoke and do not want to quit. Therefore, our long-term goal is to improve tobacco education and programming that will lead to better tobacco prevention efforts among AI communities. Our team has successfully used community-based participatory research (CBPR) to address tobacco use with AI communities since 2003. Our community partners requested that we examine additional ways to improve tobacco prevention efforts. We will address the following specific aims: (1) Develop a HL measure that is specific to tobacco use among AI populations by using CBPR to create a culturally relevant instrument that examines tobacco HL knowledge and risk; (2) Determine the reliability and validity of a tobacco HL measure among AI populations by testing it with AI adults (long form, n=250; short form, n=100). We will use experts to estimate content validity and factor analysis on participants' responses to estimate instrument's dimension and reliability. Our rationale for this project is tha the use of a tobacco HL instrument will lead to the design of better primary and secondary prevention tools, thus reducing tobacco-related disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: American Indians (AI) suffer greater tobacco-related health disparities than any other ethnic group in the United States due to rates of tobacco use that are twice as high as other ethnic groups. This study has the potential to help reduce tobacco use among AI and could ultimately help reduce rates of associated cancers (primarily lung) and cardiovascular disease. The tobacco health literacy instrument, if successful, can be incorporated into existing cessation programs and primary prevention efforts throughout the AI population, thus reducing tobacco-related outcomes in this underserved population.",Development of a Tobacco Health Literacy Instrument,9042323,R21CA191158,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Kansas ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Plants ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Printing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Measurement ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Oral ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Medical center ', ' quantitative literacy ', ' proficient in math ', ' numeracy ', ' number sense ', ' mathematical proficiency ', ' mathematical compentency ', ' mathematical compentence ', ' mathematical achievement ', ' mathematic proficiency ', ' mathematic compentency ', ' mathematic compentence ', ' mathematic achievement ', ' mathematic ability ', ' math proficiency ', ' math competency ', ' math competence ', ' math achievement ', ' math ability ', ' mathematical ability ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Reporting ', ' Readability ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Qualifying ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' tobacco control ', ' tobacco use prevention ', ' prevent tobacco use ', ' tobacco prevention ', ' functional health literacy ', ' health literacy ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' northern plains ', ' tribal university ', ' tribal college ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' high risk ', ' health equity ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2016,176481,0.10821197205307988
"Rescuing Cognitive and Emotional Regulatory Processes to Aid Smoking Prevention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research to date provides overwhelming evidence that low socio-economic status (SES) youth are at an increased risk for smoking. Converging evidence from developmental studies, psychopathology studies, intervention studies, and basic research on self-control abilities, have identified working memory and distress tolerance as potential crucial modifiable risk factors to prevent smoking onset in this cohort. To confirm the value of these targets, this study is designed to evaluate the individual and combined influence of working memory and distress tolerance interventions on risk of smoking initiation. We are targeting a high-risk (low SES adolescents) population at a highly relevant period (high school) for smoking onset, and studying crucial covariates--parental smoking, peer smoking, and sensation seeking -- of particular relevance to the study cohort in order to provide more-precise estimates of the influence of the experimental variables and to more fully characterize variables of influence for the population under study. The effects of the interventions are studied against a backdrop of a standard antismoking informational intervention - the sort of intervention that has shown less success with low SES adolescents. Overall, we propose to randomize at least 150 adolescents to one of three intervention conditions: (1) a control condition offering health education combined with a smoking prevention informational intervention (C+SPII), (2) a working memory intervention delivered prior to a smoking prevention informational intervention (WM+SPII), and (3) a distress tolerance training intervention delivered prior to a smoking prevention informational intervention (DI+SPII). The effect of these conditions on proximal smoking risk variables as well as one-year smoking outcomes will be assessed.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most smokers begin smoking before the age of 18 years, and rates of smoking initiation are higher for low-income youth. This project is designed to provide fundamental knowledge to inform drug prevention interventions by attending to working memory and distress tolerance as crucial risk factors for smoking initiation among low-income youth. We will study the usefulness of interventions designed to enhance working memory capacity and distress tolerance for reducing proximal risk for smoking and actual smoking behavior among low-income high school students.        ",Rescuing Cognitive and Emotional Regulatory Processes to Aid Smoking Prevention,9090751,R21DA041531,"['Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maintenance ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Nicotine ', ' Poverty ', ' Probability ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Sensation ', ' Esthesia ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' self control ', ' Self-control as a personality trait ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Reporting ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' emotional distress ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief intervention ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' anti-smoking ', ' Antismoking ', ' Cognitive ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Smoking Prevention ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' discount ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' discounting ', ' Population ', ' 18 year old ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' modifiable risk ', ' Affective ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' brief prevention intervention ', ' brief preventive intervention ', ' distress tolerance ', ' coping mechanism ', ' High School Student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' affective disturbance ', ' mindfulness intervention ', ' mindfulness-based intervention ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Attitude ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' ']",NIDA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2016,257649,0.18261269411930536
"Sex Differences in the Mechanisms that Promote Nicotine Reward and Withdrawal DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use remains a major public health and economic concern, particularly in women who are more vulnerable to the long-term health consequences of smoking than men. Despite the magnitude of the problem, there is a fundamental knowledge gap in our understanding of the mechanisms that promote tobacco use in females. If this knowledge gap is not filled, then reducing tobacco use and developing specialized medications for female smokers will remain largely incomprehensible. The long-term goal of our research program is to identify the mechanisms that mediate tobacco use among different clinical populations that are uniquely susceptible to this problem. The objective of this renewal is to determine the neural mechanisms that promote tobacco use in females. The central hypothesis is that females are more susceptible to tobacco use than males because of stronger rewarding effects of nicotine and heightened anxiety produced by withdrawal from this drug. Our mechanistic hypothesis is that estradiol (E2) promotes the rewarding effects of nicotine and magnifies the stress produced by nicotine withdrawal in females. More specifically, we postulate that sex differences in response to nicotine are modulated within the neural circuits of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), where dopamine is increased following nicotine administration and decreased during withdrawal from this drug. Thus, females experience greater rewarding effects of nicotine in the presence of E2, which promotes dopamine release in the NAcc. Following repeated nicotine exposure, opponent processes develop to counteract the chronic over-activation of dopamine release. We suggest that the emergence of these opponent processes is evident during withdrawal from chronic nicotine as an increase in the stress hormone, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in the NAcc. This increase in CRF levels enhances the inhibitory tone in the NAcc, which results in a decrease in dopamine release during nicotine withdrawal. Thus, females experience greater anxiety during nicotine withdrawal in the presence of E2, which promotes the recruitment of opponent stress systems that suppress dopamine release in the NAcc. The proposed studies reflect a multi- disciplinary approach involving neurochemical, behavioral, and gene transfer techniques to compare sex differences in the rewarding effects of nicotine (Aim 1) and the aversive states produced by withdrawal (Aim 2) because both of these factors are believed to promote tobacco use in females. The approach to studying sex differences involves comparisons of male, female, and OVX female rats. If the removal of ovarian hormones reverses the proposed measures in females, then the role of E2 will be assessed in OVX rats that will receive E2 supplementation and will be tested following E2 or vehicle administration. At the completion of this project, our findings will help us develop a unifying hypothesis regarding the factors that promote tobacco use in females. This exemplifies the significance of this research because a better understanding of the mechanisms that fuel tobacco use in females will lead to more effective treatments to reduce health disparities in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because our findings will be an important step toward elucidating the neural substrates that promote addiction pathology in women. Thus, our studies are relevant to the mission of NIH to support research aimed at reducing the burden of tobacco abuse, especially in women who are most vulnerable to the long-term effects of tobacco use.",Sex Differences in the Mechanisms that Promote Nicotine Reward and Withdrawal,9050655,R01DA021274,"['Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estradiol ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mission ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neurochemical ', ' neurochemistry ', ' Nicotine ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Nicotine Withdrawal ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Self Administration ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' drug withdrawal ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Microdialysis ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' tobacco abuse ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dependence ', ' System ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' novel ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' Ovarian hormone ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' response ', ' Transgenesis ', ' Gene Transfer Techniques ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Supplementation ', ' transfer of a gene ', ' Gene Transfer ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' health economics ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Affective ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' anxiety-like behavior ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' Anxiety ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' corticotropin releasing hormone ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticoliberin ', ' CRF-41 ', ' ACTH-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Dopamine ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO,R01,2016,404653,0.09801115594627277
"Ovarian Hormones Effect on Smoking Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco smoking is a leading cause of preventable death and disability in the U.S. Although women compared to men are at a greater risk of smoking-related disease morbidity and mortality, research suggests they may smoke for different reasons than men and have a harder time quitting than men. Research identifying female-specific factors underlying addiction is critical for: (a) addressing sex-related health disparities; (b) informing female-specific treatments; and (c) discovering addiction processes that are overrepresented among females yet applicable to both sexes. Ovarian hormones represent a female specific factor implicate in the maintenance of nicotine addiction and success following a quit attempt. This proposal aims to advance this line of research by combining ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with daily hormonal sampling across an entire menstrual cycle to further examine the patterns and mechanisms of ovarian hormone variation effects on smoking in women in real time. The use of prospective daily recordings and hormonal sampling will allow us to test whether smoking will be higher on days with high estrogen and lower on days with high progesterone (Aim 1), that women with greater estrogen to progesterone ratios compared to women with lower estrogen to progesterone ratios across the entire menstrual cycle will smoke more and be more nicotine dependent (Aim 2), and that days with higher estrogen will be marked by greater nicotine reward and worse cognitive control, which will mediate relations between higher estrogen and increased smoking (Aim 3). Secondary aims will explore variability of hormonal effects across the menstrual cycle (Aim 4). As the first comprehensive study investigating daily changes in ovarian hormones, drug reward, cognitive control, and smoking behavior, this project will pave the way for a program of research involving more intensive laboratory and field-based studies of psychoneuroendocrinological underpinnings of smoking in women.  Through expert mentoring, directed readings, formal coursework and seminars, onsite training, attending national scientific meetings, manuscript and grant preparation, mentorship of students in the USC Health, Emotion, and Addiction Laboratory, and the completion of the proposed investigation expertise will be gained in: (a) Naturalistic field assessment of nicotine addiction; (b) EMA design and implementation; and (c) Use of advanced statistical methodology to test the aims outlined by the project.

"Sex Differences in the Mechanisms that Promote Nicotine Reward and Withdrawal DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use remains a major public health and economic concern, particularly in women who are more vulnerable to the long-term health consequences of smoking than men. Despite the magnitude of the problem, there is a fundamental knowledge gap in our understanding of the mechanisms that promote tobacco use in females. If this knowledge gap is not filled, then reducing tobacco use and developing specialized medications for female smokers will remain largely incomprehensible. The long-term goal of our research program is to identify the mechanisms that mediate tobacco use among different clinical populations that are uniquely susceptible to this problem. The objective of this renewal is to determine the neural mechanisms that promote tobacco use in females. The central hypothesis is that females are more susceptible to tobacco use than males because of stronger rewarding effects of nicotine and heightened anxiety produced by withdrawal from this drug. Our mechanistic hypothesis is that estradiol (E2) promotes the rewarding effects of nicotine and magnifies the stress produced by nicotine withdrawal in females. More specifically, we postulate that sex differences in response to nicotine are modulated within the neural circuits of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), where dopamine is increased following nicotine administration and decreased during withdrawal from this drug. Thus, females experience greater rewarding effects of nicotine in the presence of E2, which promotes dopamine release in the NAcc. Following repeated nicotine exposure, opponent processes develop to counteract the chronic over-activation of dopamine release. We suggest that the emergence of these opponent processes is evident during withdrawal from chronic nicotine as an increase in the stress hormone, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in the NAcc. This increase in CRF levels enhances the inhibitory tone in the NAcc, which results in a decrease in dopamine release during nicotine withdrawal. Thus, females experience greater anxiety during nicotine withdrawal in the presence of E2, which promotes the recruitment of opponent stress systems that suppress dopamine release in the NAcc. The proposed studies reflect a multi- disciplinary approach involving neurochemical, behavioral, and gene transfer techniques to compare sex differences in the rewarding effects of nicotine (Aim 1) and the aversive states produced by withdrawal (Aim 2) because both of these factors are believed to promote tobacco use in females. The approach to studying sex differences involves comparisons of male, female, and OVX female rats. If the removal of ovarian hormones reverses the proposed measures in females, then the role of E2 will be assessed in OVX rats that will receive E2 supplementation and will be tested following E2 or vehicle administration. At the completion of this project, our findings will help us develop a unifying hypothesis regarding the factors that promote tobacco use in females. This exemplifies the significance of this research because a better understanding of the mechanisms that fuel tobacco use in females will lead to more effective treatments to reduce health disparities in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because our findings will be an important step toward elucidating the neural substrates that promote addiction pathology in women. Thus, our studies are relevant to the mission of NIH to support research aimed at reducing the burden of tobacco abuse, especially in women who are most vulnerable to the long-term effects of tobacco use.",Sex Differences in the Mechanisms that Promote Nicotine Reward and Withdrawal,9263075,R01DA021274,"['Anxiety ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' corticotropin releasing hormone ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticoliberin ', ' CRF-41 ', ' ACTH-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Dopamine ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estradiol ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mission ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neurochemical ', ' neurochemistry ', ' Nicotine ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Nicotine Withdrawal ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Self Administration ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' drug withdrawal ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Microdialysis ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' tobacco abuse ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dependence ', ' System ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' experience ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' novel ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' Ovarian hormone ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' response ', ' Transgenesis ', ' Gene Transfer Techniques ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Supplementation ', ' transfer of a gene ', ' Gene Transfer ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' health economics ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Affective ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' anxiety-like behavior ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO,R01,2016,42280,0.09801115594627277
"Applying mHealth to Tobacco-related Health Disparities: Enhancing aspects of Resiliency to aid Cessation Efforts ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and is the leading cause of lung cancer. The majority of individuals who smoke indicate they want to quit, and although half of all smokers make a quit attempt every year, only 6% successfully do so. Lower education levels, poverty, and unemployment are potent predictors of greater difficulty quitting smoking. Additionally, SES-related tobacco disparities have increased over the last several decades. Increased knowledge regarding those factors that allow individuals to be successful in staying quit is key to eliminatig smoking-related cancers and illnesses in these populations. One promising factor related to increased cessation success is mindfulness, which is the ability to attend to the present moment with purpose (e.g., not on autopilot) and without labeling thoughts/emotions/sensations as good or bad (e.g., an attitude of nonjudgment). Mindfulness is associated with increased cessation success and with key mechanisms influencing cessation such as affect and self-regulatory capacity. However, there is a distinct lack of data on real-time, real-world measures of smoking, the underlying mechanisms associated with abstinence (particularly those that may be unique among low SES populations), and how mindfulness impacts those potential mechanisms. The objective of this application is to utilize real-time, real-world measurement approaches (i.e., ecological momentary assessment [EMA] and AutoSense) to examine the impact of mindfulness on key mechanisms underlying smoking cessation among low SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers. Christine Vinci, Ph.D. is a postdoctoral fellow at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and is seeking 5 years of support through the K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award through the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, in order to examine the role of mindfulness on key mechanisms implicated in cessation among low SES, diverse populations. This proposal directly addresses the mission of NIMHD to ""lead scientific research to improve minority health and eliminate health disparities."" Dr. Vinci's research broadly focuses on cognitive and affective mechanisms (e.g., affect regulation, expectancies, self- efficacy) implicated in the development, maintenance, and treatment of substance use disorders. More specifically, her work aims to understand the mechanisms underlying smoking and alcohol use among underserved populations, with a specific focus on mindfulness. A better understanding of the effects of mindfulness on smoking and problematic drinking, and the mechanisms through which mindfulness-based interventions impact these disorders could help in the development of new and more effective interventions. For this award, the primary research aims are twofold. First, the examination of trait and state mindfulness on momentary mechanisms gathered via advanced technology (EMA and AutoSense) among low SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers will be conducted via secondary data analysis of existing datasets of Dr. Vinci's primary mentor, Dr. David Wetter. Second, the feasibility of providing mindfulness strategies in real-time to low SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers attempting to quit smoking, based on objective data collected via AutoSense technology, will be examined. The first aim will take place during the K99 phase of the award, where Dr. Vinci will be provided with guidance by expert mentors in their respective fields. The training and guidance received during the K99 phase will directly inform the implementation of the second aim, which will take place during the R00 phase of the award. This project is highly innovative because 1) to date, no studies have examined these constructs via real-world, real-time data among low SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers through combined approaches such as EMA and AutoSense, and 2) findings can directly inform treatment development to specify how mindfulness impacts underlying mechanisms, leading to the reduction of tobacco- related health disparities. Dr. Vinci's training goals include learning how to design and implement research protocols that utilize advanced technology to collect participant data (EMA and AutoSense), how to conduct advanced statistical analyses on multi-level, longitudinal data, and how to combine knowledge and strategies from diverse areas of research (i.e., models linking social determinants and SES to health outcomes, tobacco use and dependence, resiliency and mindfulness, self-regulation) to create intervention approaches to reduce health disparities. Both the training received through this award and the preliminary data Dr. Vinci will collect and analyze, will aid her in the transition to an independent clinical researcher, where she will examine relevant mechanisms via mobile technology and implement mindfulness-based strategies to reduce problematic health behaviors and improve quality of life among diverse populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cigarette smoking is one of the leading causes of preventable death in the US, the primary cause of lung cancer, and is one of the leading causes of health disparities. Assisting individuals in staying quit is vital to eliminating smoking-related cancers, particularly among low SES, racial/ethnic populations, as these groups are most impacted by cancer-related health disparities. This research will build upon and expand what we know about smoking relapse and can potentially contribute to enhancing smoking cessation treatments, specifically targeting the prevention of relapse once an individual successfully quits smoking.        ",Applying mHealth to Tobacco-related Health Disparities: Enhancing aspects of Resiliency to aid Cessation Efforts,9257685,K99MD010468,"['Affect ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Emotions ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Poverty ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sensation ', ' Esthesia ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Event ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' trait ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' drinking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' social ', ' relapse prevention ', ' recurrence prevention ', ' disorder recurrence prevention ', ' disease recurrence prevention ', ' disorder later incidence prevention ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Cognitive ', ' University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ', ' MDACC ', ' University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center ', ' To specify ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' minority health ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Affective ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' mindfulness ', ' smoking relapse ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' mindfulness intervention ', ' mindfulness-based intervention ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' ']",NIMHD,RICE UNIVERSITY,K99,2016,98194,0.23490364165314062
"A guided imagery tobacco cessation intervention delivered by a quitline and website ABSTRACT  Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of death accounting for more than 480,000 deaths each year, and 16 million Americans suffer from one or more diseases caused by smoking. Cessation of tobacco use can significantly reduce the risk of disease. Telephone quitlines are an effective and highly scalable way to help individuals quit smoking. However quitlines are an underutilized resource, and do not reach certain segments of the population, including males and racial/ethnic minorities. Guided imagery is a form of mind-body therapy that involves controlled visualization of specific mental images, and shares similarities with mindfulness meditation. Multiple studies have shown that exposure to mindfulness and imagery training results in significantly increased smoking abstinence rates. Also, imagery is used by a significant number of racially diverse male and female athletes. Although imagery is an effective tool for smoking  cessation, the mode of delivery has generally been in person, limiting the dissemination to large populations. We hypothesize that guided mental imagery delivered using the uitline “coaching model” combined with an interactive website could be an effective and disseminable intervention strategy. In addition, this model may be more readily accepted by underrepresented smokers, and may increase the reach and effectiveness of telephone quitlines. Therefore, the objective of this three year R34 application is to develop and test the feasibility of a theory-driven, telephone plus web-based, guided mental imagery intervention for smoking cessation. We will develop the intervention and attention-control condition, study procedures, training protocols, and competency testing models with input from quitline personnel, and focus and user groups of smokers in preparation for a randomized clinical trial. We will conduct a feasibility trial (N=100) to gather preliminary data on recruitment, retention, and preliminary estimates of the potential effects of the guided mental imagery intervention on quitline callers’ tobacco use, cravings, and self-efficacy to quit smoking. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the Imagery Intervention or a matched control condition delivered by project imagery coaches. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6-weeks and 6-months post-enrollment. Primary outcomes will be self-reported point prevalence and prolonged abstinence of tobacco use. A subsample of 20 quitters will be tested for salivary cotinine as biochemical validation of self-report in this population.  Secondary outcomes will be self-reported cravings and self-efficacy. A manual of procedures will be developed to prepare us to conduct a future randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of the imagery intervention. The proposed project has the potential to advance the science of tobacco cessation through the addition of guided mental imagery, and improve public health through increased reach of telephone quitlines. It is innovative in that it uses guided imagery to address theory-driven targets of self-efficacy for abstinence and cravings. If successful, this model could be expanded to address other health behaviors such as diet, physical activity and other substance use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tobacco use is still the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States. Tobacco quitlines are effective at helping smokers to quit, but they are underutilized, especially by men and racial/ethnic minorities. Guided imagery is effective at helping people quit smoking, and is appealing to males and diverse racial groups, but has limited reach. The proposed study will develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of a guided imagery tobacco cessation intervention that is delivered by a combination of quitline coaches and an interactive website.",A guided imagery tobacco cessation intervention delivered by a quitline and website,9177876,R34AT008947,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Attention ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Scotine ', ' Cotinine ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Persons ', ' Nicotine ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Sports ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Woman ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Bupropion ', ' buproprion ', ' Wellbutrin ', ' Amfebutamone ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Guided imagery ', ' Psychotherapeutic Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Biochemical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' satisfaction ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Salivary ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Techniques ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' high school ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Devices ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' mind body wellness ', ' mind body treatments ', ' mind body therapy ', ' mind body techniques ', ' mind body medicine skills ', ' mind body approach ', ' Mind-Body Medicine ', ' Mind-Body Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Validity of Self Report ', ' Preparation ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' tobacco control ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' mental imagery ', ' usability ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' mindfulness ', ' mindfulness meditation ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' ']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R34,2016,278122,0.2423780967475508
"Evaluating racial and ethnic disparities in the success of national health care efforts to promote smoking cessation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There have been multiple attempts in the U.S. to close the gap in the quality of health care for diverse racial and ethnic subpopulations. In 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services launched the Healthy People 2020 plan. Two of four main goals of the plan are decreasing racial and ethnic health disparities and attaining high-quality lives free of preventable diseases. Because of this and other programs, a number of improvements in health care have been made that should help reduce health disparities in the U.S. Despite these efforts, some racial/ethnic minority groups still have considerably higher mortality rates from cancer and other smoking-caused conditions and diseases than Non-Hispanic (NH) White people. In addition, there are limited research findings regarding public awareness, efficacy and availability of smoking cessation methods for racial/ethnic minorities. The overall goals of the proposed study are to determine the quality of smoking- cessation-related (SCR) health care for diverse racial and ethnic groups, over-time changes in the quality of the SCR health care, and smokers' awareness and attitudes regarding currently available smoking cessation methods and treatments, as well as identify methods that have been used to successfully quit smoking. The primary investigation will focus on assessing potential differences with respect to each of these factors across the largest racial/ethnic U.S. subpopulations (i.e., NH White, NH Black/African American, and Hispanic); the secondary investigation will concern smaller U.S. subpopulations: NH American Indian/Alaska Native, NH Asian, and NH Multiracial. The necessity of differentiating between relatively large and small subpopulations is confirmed by the preliminary research findings. The data from the Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) will be used. The TUS-CPS is the key source of data on smoking behaviors among diverse racial/ethnic groups, including small U.S. subpopulations. The proposed research is innovative because it is the first study to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of smoking cessation efforts across diverse racial/ethnic groups using a representative sample of the adult U.S. population and the first to examine longitudinal changes in the quality of the SCR health care services, as well as differences in the SCR health care services offered to diverse racial/ethnic minorities and non-minorities. Results of the proposed study are expected to play a vital role in improving the health care system as a whole, helping to close the gap in the quality of health care services offered to racial/ethnic minorities and non-minorities, and further decreasing rates of smoking-caused conditions and diseases across all subpopulations. The research findings will be beneficial for further refining smoking cessation programs for diverse subpopulations of smokers, increasing awareness of available smoking cessation interventions and medical treatments, and reducing smoking prevalence and rates of smoking-caused diseases and conditions, especially in underserved Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The study will determine the quality of smoking-cessation-related (SCR) health care for diverse racial and ethnic groups, over-time changes in the quality of the SCR health care, and smoker's awareness and attitudes regarding currently available smoking cessation methods (including medical treatments), as well as which methods have been used to successfully quit smoking. Potential discrepancies with respect to each of these factors will be assessed across diverse racial/ethnic U.S. subpopulations.

"Socioeconomic status, stress, and smoking cessation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Smoking is a major cause of health disparities, and socioeconomic status (SES) is strongly associated with lower rates of smoking cessation. Several major conceptual models have been proposed that share a key, common mechanism linking SES to health behaviors such as cessation, noting that the life circumstances associated with low SES lead to greater exposure to stress, which then influences behavior. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among low SES individuals is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of SES and social history, contextual and environmental influences, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, and acute momentary precipitants on stress, smoking lapse, and abstinence among 300 smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed using real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of Autosense, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and geographic positioning system (GPS). Autosense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or encounters a stressor. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse and stress ascertained in real time through Autosense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is the first study to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by low SES individuals.

"Use and Effectiveness of Tobacco Pharmacotherapy: A Phase IV Sex Difference Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women experience significant disparities with regards to smoking cessation, and research has identified key factors underlying poor treatment response including differential response to smoking cessation medications. Despite this knowledge, findings have yet to translate into improved clinical outcomes for smoking cessation, and current guidelines provide little information on sex-based practices. One critical barrier for the translation to clinical practice is the lack of evidence from Phase-IV population-based studies. To date, evidence has exclusively emerged from Phase-III clinical trial data; sex differences in real-world effectiveness of stop smoking medications remain unknown. We will conduct a Phase-IV pharmacoepidemiologic study of sex differences in smoking cessation effectiveness in a U.S. nationally representative sample. [[[E-cigarette use during cessation attempts and associations with quitting will also be examined.]]] Our study will be a secondary analysis of the first wave of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study (scheduled to be released in the Fall of 2015), which was initiated and funded by NIDA and the FDA. The study's large sample size (~59,000) and its inclusion of information on medication/e-cigarette use during attempts to stop smoking will present a unique and unprecedented opportunity to address the study's aims. The project will also serve as the foundation for an R01 application for subsequent analyses of longitudinal waves of PATH data. [[[Our primary aim will be to examine sex differences in the real world comparative effectiveness of smoking cessation medications, using both regression and propensity score approaches, and following published guidelines for medication effectiveness studies using secondary data sources.]]] Data from current and former smokers who attempted to quit smoking (either successfully or unsuccessfully) at least once during the 12 months prior to their interview (n~8,215; 4,240 men and 3,975 women) will be analyzed. The investigation will examine the comparative effectiveness of the following medications: nicotine replacement therapy (the patch, oral NRT, nasal spray), varenicline/Chantix, and bupropion/Wellbutrin/Zyban. We will explore whether sex differences in medication effectiveness are moderated by education level, annual income, race/ethnicity, nicotine dependence level, and mental health. [[[We will also explore sex differences in associations between use of e-cigarettes during cessation attempts and likelihood of successful cessation.]]] This study addresses the National Institute on Drug Abuse's (NIDA) call for projects that ""assess the differential effectiveness of current drug abuse treatments in males and females"" (PA-14-037: Women & Sex/Gender Differences in Drug and Alcohol/Dependence).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Evidence from clinical trials suggests smoking cessation medications (e.g., nicotine patch, varenicline/Chantix, bupropion/Wellbutrin/Zyban) may be more or less effective depending on the sex of the smoker. However, these differences in medication effectiveness have not been studied among smokers trying to quit in real world contexts. This project will help inform the treatment of nicotine addiction by studying sex differences in the comparative effectiveness of stop smoking medications in real-world contexts.        ",Use and Effectiveness of Tobacco Pharmacotherapy: A Phase IV Sex Difference Study,9110529,R03DA040093,"['Animals ', ' Biology ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Utilization ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Inhaler ', ' Inhalators ', ' Interview ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Respiratory System, Nose, Nasal Passages ', ' Nasal Passages Nose ', ' Nasal ', ' Nose ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Tobacco ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Woman ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Bupropion ', ' buproprion ', ' Wellbutrin ', ' Amfebutamone ', ' falls ', ' Schedule ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Ensure ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' phase III protocol ', ' phase 3 trial ', ' Phase 3 Clinical Trials ', ' Phase III Clinical Trials ', ' Smoker ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' nicotine patch ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Investigation ', ' Oral ', ' experience ', ' Cigarette ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Zyban ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cessation Research ', ' Collection ', ' sex ', ' varenicline ', ' Chantix ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Alcohol dependence ', ' alcohol-dependent ', ' alcohol dependency ', ' alcohol addiction ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' comparative ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' e-cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' health data ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NIDA,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R03,2016,78459,0.21435155824205532
"Unjust Targeting: How Marketing Features Impact Consumer Response and Tobacco Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research contributes to Tobacco Regulatory Science by connecting (1) tobacco marketing features with (2) consumer affective, cognitive and physiological response to marketing images and (3) tobacco product perceptions and use outcomes in ethnically diverse populations (African American, Asian American, Latino and non-Hispanic white). By identifying key features of tobacco marketing (e.g. colors, descriptors, branding, marketing claims) that optimize consumer response to the marketing and ultimately connecting that to tobacco use outcomes over time, this project adds to the evidence base used to regulate tobacco marketing. This project will provide a comprehensive description of the tobacco marketing landscape and an inventory of 'high impact' tobacco marketing features that produce inequitable outcomes in tobacco use. Additionally, by examining consumers' affective, cognitive and physiologic response to ads, this project will illuminate the underlying mechanisms through which these marketing features operate. The aims of this project are to: (1) describe key features of tobacco marketing targeted towards (a) African Americans, (b) Asian Americans, (c) Latinos (including Mexican Americans, Cubans and Puerto Ricans) and (d) non-Hispanic whites; (2) identify how marketing features impact response to ads for Latinos and Latino subgroups; and (3) for each ethnic group, demonstrate how tobacco product use is initiated and changes as a result of awareness of advertising and having a favorite ad and identify marketing features associated with tobacco product use. To accomplish these aims, the proposed research leverages the infrastructures of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study and the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), linking ad-level data from a PATH ad-hoc study that content codes tobacco marketing images with longitudinal PATH data and conducting an ancillary study to the HCHS/SOL assessing self-report and physiological response to tobacco ads. To execute these aims, I will work with a team of mentors who are internationally known scholars. Dr. John Elder, Professor in the Graduate School of Public Health at San Diego State University will be my primary mentor; Dr. John Pierce, Professor in the Department of Family & Preventive Medicine and Moores Cancer Center at UC-San Diego and a lead investigator on the PATH study and Dr. Lourdes Baezconde-Garbanati, Associate Professor of Preventive Medicine at the University of Southern California and Project Leader on the USC Tobacco Center of Regulatory Sciences (P50) will be secondary mentors. This training will provide me with expertise in longitudinal, epidemiological study design, management and analysis, tobacco use health disparities, tobacco regulatory policy and physiological measurement of ad response. This will facilitate my integration into the Tobacco Regulatory Science community and allow me to achieve my long-term career goal of becoming an independent, leading investigator and expert in Tobacco Regulatory Science with a specific focus on communication-based research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project impacts public health by providing knowledge necessary for the effective regulation of tobacco marketing. By linking specific features of tobacco marketing (e.g. colors, marketing claims, descriptors, branding) to consumers' response to ads and their tobacco product perceptions and use behaviors, this work provides the FDA with insight into how specifically tobacco marketing produces inequitable tobacco use outcomes. Ultimately, this will facilitate tobacco marketing regulations that will result in lower rates of tobacco use and disease and death associated with tobacco use.",Unjust Targeting: How Marketing Features Impact Consumer Response and Tobacco Use,9121523,K01DA037903,"['Advertising ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Archives ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' family medicine ', ' Family Practice ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Market Research ', ' Marketing ', ' Mentors ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Perception ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' RQ2 ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Central American ', ' Policies ', ' Research Activity ', ' Measurement ', ' Descriptor ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' South American ', ' Pattern ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' preference ', ' professor ', ' skills ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' risk perception ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dominican ', ' p50 ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily Member 5 Gene ', ' TNFRSF5 ', ' MGC9013 ', ' CDW40 ', ' CD40 ', ' Bp50 ', ' TNFRSF5 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Tobacco Epidemiology ', ' Tobacco Use Epidemiology ', ' Characteristics ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Affective ', ' evidence base ', ' population health ', ' arm ', ' health data ', ' mid-career faculty ', ' associate professor ', ' associate faculty ', ' Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos ', ' HCHS/SOL cohort ', ' HCHS/SOL Study ', ' Study of Latinos ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' Cuban ', ' ']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,154059,0.11660224081716487
"A trial of Positively Smoke Free group therapy for HIV-infected smokers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are 1.1 million persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the US, 60% of them smoke cigarettes, and 75% of these are interested in quitting. Almost none are currently accessing smoking cessation interventions designed to meet their specific needs and concerns.  Cigarette smoking is responsible for 24% of deaths among PLWH, and 30% of non-AIDS defining malignancies. It is driving the alarming rise in cardiac events and lung cancers in this highly vulnerable population. The lack of access to proven, effective, culturally appropriate tobacco cessation services represents a health disparity of the first order. The psychosocial profile of the PLWH-smoker community, characterized by high rates of psychiatric comorbidity, drug and alcohol use, and low levels of social support, suggests that achieving high cessation rates will be a great challenge.  Positively Smoke Free (PSF) is an intensive, multisession, group cessation program specifically developed for PLWH smokers. A pilot study of PSF yielded promising results. This proposal aims (1) to perform a definitive efficacy study of PSF by comparing 6-month biochemically confirmed abstinence rates in subjects randomized to PSF vs. standard care in a cohort of 450 PLWH smokers, (2) to determine the sociobehavioral moderators and mediators associated with successful cessation, and (3) to complete a careful cost analysis of PSF in order to estimate the incremental cost per quit associated program participation.  If PSF is proven to be effective it will establish a new treatment option for PLWH smokers. Determination of moderators and mediators of program success will provide insight into the mode of action of the intervention and will help guide the development of additional treatment strategies in the future. Finally, the cost analyses will provide critical information abut the feasibility of program dissemination and implementation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic of cigarette smoking is fueling an alarming rise in lung and other cancers in persons living with HIV (PLWH). Smokers living with HIV have few, if any, cessation resources available to them that address their particular needs, and HIV care providers have virtually no evidence base to guide their approach to tobacco treatment. The proposal, if funded, will conduct a definitive study of a group therapy intervention for PLWH smokers that showed promise in a pilot trial.",A trial of Positively Smoke Free group therapy for

"Advancing Tobacco Use Treatment for African American Smokers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With a 50% greater relative-risk of smoking attributed lung cancer than Whites, and the highest overall rates of cancer incidence and mortality in the U.S., African Americans experience disproportionately greater tobacco- related disease burden. Striking health disparities exist despite the fact that African Americans have similar smoking prevalence as Whites, yet smoke fewer cigarettes per day (cpd). In fact, over half of all African American smokers are light smokers (smoke 10 or fewer cpd). To have an impact on the premature mortality of African American smokers, effective treatment for smokers across the smoking continuum must be identified. Varenicline, the leading first-line medication for tobacco use treatment, triples the likelihood of long-term abstinence relative to placebo in those smoking >10 cpd. To date, efficacy of varenicline has not been established in African American smokers or light smokers. The long-term goal of this research is to advance treatment for all African American smokers in order to reduce tobacco-related disease and death. Our primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of varenicline for tobacco use treatment among 500 African American smokers, including a full range of cpd, within a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. We will randomize participants in a 3:2 ratio to receive varenicline (1 mg bid; n=300) or placebo (n=200) for 12 weeks, along with individualized health education counseling for all participants. Our specific aims are to evaluate the efficacy of varenicline to promote abstinence in African American smokers across the continuum of smoking level, to examine efficacy in light smokers and also in moderate to heavy smokers, to characterize nicotine and carcinogen exposure, and to describe biopsychosocial characteristics of this group and evaluate in relation to abstinence. This innovative study will provide the first placebo-controlled evaluatin of varenicline in the full spectrum of African American smokers, and the first to examine varenicline in light smokers. Findings will contribute to advancing effective treatment for African American smokers and for light smokers, and enhancing individualized treatment. Increased treatment efficacy will have major impact on reducing tobacco- related morbidity and mortality in this high-risk population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans experience the highest levels of tobacco-related disease and death, despite smoking fewer cigarettes per day than Whites. Advancing treatment for African American smokers is a critical public health priority. This study will evaluate the efficacy of varenicline treatment to improve quit rates in African American daily smokers of all smoking levels, with the goal of reducing tobacco-related health disparities.",Advancing Tobacco Use Treatment for African American Smokers,9040136,R01DA035796,"['neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Scotine ', ' Cotinine ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Incidence ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Menthol ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Nicotine ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Placebos ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Tobacco ', ' Bupropion ', ' buproprion ', ' Wellbutrin ', ' Amfebutamone ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' improved ', ' Biochemical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Evaluation ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' Cigarette ', ' Participant ', ' Treatment Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' tobacco-related cancer ', ' tobacco-induced cancer ', ' Tobacco-Related Carcinoma ', ' Adherence ', ' Intake ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Characteristics ', ' varenicline ', ' Placebo Control ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Carcinogen exposure ', ' Abstinence ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' FDA approved ', ' primary outcome ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' public health priorities ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' disparities in morbidity ', ' morbidity disparities ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,636299,0.19890704333353695
"Randomized Trial of an Innovative Smartphone Intervention for Smoking Cessation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is tremendous need for smoking cessation intervention technologies with strong potential population-level impact at the lowest possible cost. That potential can be found in the newest technological innovation in quit smoking interventions: smartphone-based smoking cessation software applications (""apps""). There are over 400 smoking cessation apps, which were downloaded in the United States 3.2 million times during the two-year period 2012 to 2013. No trials of any app's effectiveness for general adult cessation have been published and no NIH-funded cessation intervention trials are in progress-despite the fact this is a high priority NIH funding topic. The enormous usage of smoking cessation apps contrasted with their unknown effectiveness creates a serious scientific gap that could stifle their population-level impact.  Research on US Clinical Practice Guidelines (USCPG) apps begins to address that research gap. But only following the USCPG has had limitations in other modalities of delivery. An approach, called Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), addresses these limitations with both innovative intervention content and highly promising results from six published trials. ACT's innovation is its dual focus on increasing willingness to experience physical cravings, emotions, and thoughts that cue smoking while making values-guided committed behavior changes. We recently developed the first ACT app for smoking cessation, called ""SmartQuit,"" and tested it in a pilot randomized controlled trial (N  196), comparing it with an app that follows USCPG (National Cancer Institute's ""QuitGuide""). Results showed that SmartQuit had: (1) higher participant engagement and satisfaction than QuitGuide, (3) higher levels of acceptance of cravings than QuitGuide, and (3) descriptively higher quit rates (albeit non-significant) than QuitGuide at the two-month follow-up.  Building on these promising results, we propose a fully-powered three-arm randomized controlled trial (n = 811 per arm) that compares SmartQuit to QuitGuide and each app to the NCI's Clearing the Air booklet, which follows the USCPG, to definitively determine whether (1) an USCPG app is more efficacious than a USCPG self-help booklet; (2) an ACT app is more efficacious than a USCPG booklet; (3) an ACT app is more efficacious than a USCPG app.  As millions of people are choosing smartphone apps to help them quit smoking, this innovative study shows exciting promise for improving the success rates of quit smoking apps and thereby lowering healthcare costs and reducing premature tobacco-related deaths. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over the two-year period of 2012-2013, smartphone applications for smoking cessation reached 3.2 million people in the United States and their reach is climbing rapidly. This randomized trial will definitively test a smartphone application-delivered Acceptance & Commitment Therapy intervention for adult smoking cessation.

"Behavioral Economic Approach to Reducing Maternal Smoking in Disadvantaged Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking among women is a substantial U.S. public health problem that is highly associated with socioeconomic status, especially low educational attainment. It is also a direct contributor to health disparities. For example, smoking prevalence in the U.S. exceeds 30 percent among women with < 12 years of education compared to less than 6 percent for women with graduate degrees. Smoking prevalence among disadvantaged mothers is at strikingly high levels (40-60 percent). Disadvantaged women begin smoking at an earlier age, are heavier smokers, and are more likely to be nicotine dependent and to fail at smoking cessation. Not surprisingly, disadvantaged women are also at increased risk for smoking-related adverse health outcomes, including adversely impacting the health of their children through in-utero and second-hand smoke exposure (SHSe). Despite widespread awareness of the adverse health consequences of SHSe, almost 85 percent of U.S. children from low-income families are chronically exposed. SHSe, especially from maternal smoking, increases risk for infant death, chronic respiratory infections, asthma, and other longer-term medical problems, and is estimated to increase direct medical and life-lost costs in the U.S. by > $5 billion annually. Efficacious interventions to increase maternal smoking cessation and reduce childhood SHSe are sorely needed. In this application we are proposing to test the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an intervention for promoting smoking-cessation among economically disadvantaged mothers of young children (< 11 yrs) that is based in the conceptual framework of behavioral economics and uses financial incentives to motivate behavior change. We are proposing to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing (1) usual care for smoking cessation and reducing SHSe among children, (2) usual care combined with financial incentives for objectively verified smoking abstinence and (3) usual care combined with financial incentives and also with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) using innovative procedures to enhance medication efficacy. We hypothesize that both interventions involving financial incentives will increase biochemically-verified smoking abstinence in mothers and decrease SHSe in their children, but that the largest and most cost-effective treatment effects will be achieved by combining financial incentives with NRT. Behavioral-economic measures of decision-making biases and cigarette-price sensitivity will be examined as predictors of treatment response. Overall, the proposed study has the potential to advance knowledge on efficacious, cost-effective smoking cessation for maternal smokers and protection against SHSe in children. The study also has the potential to impact policies and clinical practices regarding recommended care for combating chronic SHSe in disadvantaged children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are proposing to examine new strategies for helping economically disadvantaged mothers of young children to quit smoking and better protect their children from the harmful effects of being regularly exposed to cigarette smoke. We are especially interested in whether offering financial incentives for quitting and medications to reduce nicotine withdrawal might increase the proportion of mothers who successfully quit smoking and reduce smoke exposure and related illnesses among their children.",Behavioral Economic Approach to Reducing Maternal Smoking in Disadvantaged Women,9070736,R01HD078332,"['Age ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Scotine ', ' Cotinine ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mothers ', ' Nicotine ', ' Nicotine Withdrawal ', ' Pregnancy Complications ', ' Public Health ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Respiratory Infections ', ' Respiratory Tract Infections ', ' Risk ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' smoke of cigarettes ', ' cigarette smoke ', ' Policies ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' infantile death ', ' infant demise ', ' death in first year of life ', ' infant death ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Cigarette ', ' Participant ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effectiveness analyses ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Intake ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Community Practice ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' in utero ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' motivated behavior ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' maternal cigarette smoking ', ' maternal smoking ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' discounting ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' treatment effect ', ' trial comparing ', ' combat ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' clinical practice ', ' efficacy testing ', ' financial incentive ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' behavioral economics ', ' environmental tobacco smoke exposure ', ' secondhand smoke exposure ', ' second hand smoke exposure ', ' exposure to tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to cigarette smoke ', ' exposure to SHS ', ' exposure to ETS ', ' cigarette smoke exposure ', ' Community of Practice ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2016,575843,0.20551022567533364
"Yale SCOR on Gender-Sensitive Treatment for Tobacco Dependence     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Yale-SCOR is bringing together leading basic and clinical science experts to establish an interdisciplinary, translational, cross-species program of research aimed at identifying novel therapeutics to address the critical health disparity that female smokers face. Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States. Women, compared to men, have poorer rates of smoking cessation, exacerbated health risks, and FDA-approved medications for smoking cessation may not be as effective for women or have emerging limits due to side effects. However, few attempts have been made to develop gender-sensitive smoking cessation treatments. The considerable body of data suggesting that women are more likely to smoke to regulate negative affect and stress while men are more likely to smoke for the reinforcing properties of nicotine suggests an important direction in the development of a new approach to smoking cessation treatments. Using both preclinical and clinical strategies, our interdisciplinary team will probe te noradrenergic system's effects on stress-reactivity and nicotine reinforcement -hypothesizing that (a) different brain systems modulated by noradrenergic activity are activated by smoking in women and men, and (b) guanfacine (an alpha-2a noradrenergic agonist) can preferentially target these gender-sensitive systems to improve smoking cessation outcomes. Using a translational approach with an interdisciplinary team effort, we are proposing three projects that will have inter-related and shared goals, with each providing unique contributions to the development of gender-sensitive therapeutics. This new application will catalyze Yale's significant resources to support interdisciplinary and translational science in women's health to pursue extremely timely scientific findings that could represent a breakthrough in our understanding of treatments for a public health problem that affects millions daily. Our specific aims and objectives of the Yale-SCOR are to:    AIM 1: Evaluate the role of the noradrenergic system and its interactions with cholinergic and dopaminergic systems, in stress-induced smoking relapse and nicotine-based reinforcement, and use these findings to inform and expedite the development of gender-sensitive therapeutics for smoking cessation.    AIM 2: Mentor junior investigators in conducting interdisciplinary translational research on tobacco use and women's health through training opportunities, including ""clerkships"" with SCOR PIs, and pilot funding.    AIM 3: Be a national resource to invigorate and galvanize the study of sex and gender differences in relation to smoking by providing expert consultation; supporting faculty training awards; mining national data on gender, smoking and health outcomes to inform health policy; and expanding our current program of local and national community outreach.          Women compared to men, have poorer rates of smoking cessation and exacerbated health risks yet few attempts have been made to develop gender-sensitive smoking cessation treatments. This research will contribute to the public health by providing a neurobiologically-informed approach to the development of gender-sensitive therapeutics for smoking cessation, mentoring the next generation of interdisciplinary and translational researchers, and providing a national resource for women's health and tobacco use.            ",Yale SCOR on Gender-Sensitive Treatment for Tobacco Dependence,9096083,P50DA033945,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' California ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cities ', ' Consultations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Dyes ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' London ', ' Los Angeles ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Names ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Public Health ', ' Registries ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Guanfacine ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Funding ', ' Agonist ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Smoker ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Consult ', ' Services ', ' Church ', ' cholinergic ', ' noradrenergic ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Property ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' human ESC ', ' human ES cell ', ' hESC ', ' human embryonic stem cell ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Province ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Last Name ', ' Smoking and Health ', ' Smoking and Health Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Instruction ', ' performance site ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' translational approach ', ' translational strategy ', ' translation strategy ', ' FDA approved ', ' smoking relapse ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' teacher development ', ' instructor training ', ' faculty professional development ', ' faculty development ', ' Teacher Training ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Faculty Education ', ' stress reactivity ', ' training opportunity ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,P50,2016,1246354,0.2871159896441585
"Health Literacy and Smoking Cessation in Low-SES, Diverse Smokers ABSTRACT Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death and disability in the U.S., and is becoming increasingly concentrated among individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES) and racial/ethnic minorities. Nearly half of U.S. adults have difficulties with health literacy (HL), and lack the ability to obtain, understand, and use basic health information to make important decisions about healthcare. As with smoking, low HL is common among racial/ethnic minorities and those with low SES. Low HL is associated with negative health behaviors, less engagement in preventive services, and poor health outcomes. It is also associated with current smoking, key established predictors of smoking relapse, and smoking relapse, even after controlling for sociodemographic indicators. Thus, low HL appears to be an independent risk factor for poor cessation outcomes among low- SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers. Efforts are needed to elucidate mechanisms of the association between low HL and relapse, and to develop smoking cessation interventions targeting low HL smokers.  This project aims to: 1) investigate mechanisms through which HL influences smoking cessation in low- SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers enrolled in cessation treatment using secondary analyses of traditional questionnaire and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data from 2 smoking cessation treatment studies; 2) conduct a qualitative investigation with low HL smokers to further elucidate mechanisms of the association between HL and cessation and inform the development of a theoretically-based, cessation treatment targeting the specific needs of low HL smokers; 3) develop and evaluate the preliminary efficacy of a smoking cessation intervention targeting low HL smokers compared to standard treatment; and 4) examine treatment effects on secondary outcomes of interest (e.g., differential dropout, treatment satisfaction, intention to quit smoking). Results will elucidate the complex relations between HL and cessation in underserved smokers, guide treatment for low HL smokers, and contribute to reducing tobacco-related health disparities.  Diana Stewart Hoover, Ph.D. is seeking 5 years of support through a NIDA K23 Career Development Award for the proposed training and research. In order to fill critical gaps in her experience, she will obtain specialized training in behavioral intervention development targeting underserved populations, advanced statistics for analyzing longitudinal and EMA data, and qualitative methods, particularly mixed methods. She will also expand her knowledge and skills related to HL, tobacco cessation, health disparities, and research ethics. Her training and research plans will support her long-term goal of establishing an independently-funded research program in cancer prevention and tobacco cessation, with a focus on reducing tobacco-related health disparities for individuals with low HL. A comprehensive training plan is described, combining mentored research, structured mentorship activities guided by established researchers in the field, formal coursework and workshops, and participation in seminars at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Nearly half of United States adults have difficulty with health literacy, defined as ""the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions."" Individuals with health literacy difficulties are more likely to be current smokers and to have less knowledge about smoking health risks and more trouble quitting smoking, putting them at risk for poor health (e.g., more frequent diagnoses of advanced stage cancer) and premature mortality. Efforts are needed to understand mechanisms through which health literacy influences smoking cessation in order to help identify treatment targets for smokers with health literacy difficulties, improve current smoking cessation interventions, and ultimately reduce the burden of tobacco-related health disparities.","Health Literacy and Smoking Cessation in Low-SES, Diverse Smokers",9170878,K23DA040933,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dropout ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Services ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Preventing postpartum smoking relapse: a twitter-enabled supportive intervention Project Summary/Abstract An estimated 40% of women who smoke quit during their pregnancy, however, up to 80% of these women relapse in the postpartum period, despite the health risks for themselves and their children. Relapse prevention in the postpartum period offers a unique opportunity to capitalize on a positive behavioral change. Yet, the design of effective smoking interventions for postpartum relapse prevention is challenging, due in large part to the competing needs and stressors in this population, especially among low income women. New, innovative intervention delivery models are needed to provide high levels of social support for ongoing behavioral change, while simultaneously addressing the new demands associated with young babies. Twitter, one of the most popular microblogging social media platforms that facilitate an instant mode of communication via tweets (short texts), seems especially promising for delivering smoking cessation interventions among underserved populations. Guided by the Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing (C-SHIP) framework, as well as by health communication best practices, the proposed study will develop and test an evidence- based, cognitive-behavioral twitter-enabled system-generated and participant-driven intervention (Tweet2commit) designed to reduce postpartum smoking relapse among low-income minority women who have quit immediately before or during their pregnancies. The Tweet2commit will be developed through a systematic formative evaluation process that includes literature and evidence-based content review, followed by an iterative cycling of text drafting, health literacy evaluation of texts, review by targeted focus group and pre-test through usability testing. The overarching goal of Tweet2commit is to provide evidence-based information and cognitive-behavioral coping strategies, as well as to harness the potential of peer-mediated social interaction, for supporting smoking abstinence. The intervention will consist of: 1) system-generated tweets targeting C-SHIP-based relapse factors and 2) user-generated tweets: participants will be asked to tweet when commenting on the system-generated tweets or when experiencing needs for coping with lapse or relapse so their peer can respond accordingly. We will also use a combination of best practice strategies to engage online participation and peer-support exchange. A pilot RCT will be conducted to explore the efficacy of the Tweet2commit intervention on reducing postpartum relapse rates, compared to a Usual Care control. A mixed-methods approach including the analysis of objective Twitter usage data will be conducted to measure participant’s engagement and satisfaction as well as perceived barriers. The proposed research will be the first randomized controlled study that leverages the potential of Twitter for disseminating evidence-based smoking cessation strategies and harnessing the participatory nature of tweeting for live interactive mobile support groups among underserved postpartum women. The approach is innovative, evidence-based, highly transportable for wide scale dissemination, and can readily be applied to other substance abuse contexts. Project Narrative Tobacco smoking, the leading preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality, is one of the most pressing public health issues that we face as a society, particularly among those who are from lower socio- economic minority communities. The proposed study is designed to develop and evaluate a theory-guided and social media-enabled intervention (Tweet2commit) to reduce postpartum smoking relapse among underserved women in order to improve both their health and the health of their children. The intervention has the potential for wide-scale dissemination into the current social media and health care delivery infrastructure, as it is evidence-based, highly transportable, and low-cost.",Preventing postpartum smoking relapse: a twitter-enabled supportive intervention,9178916,R21CA198036,"['abstracting ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Infant ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Postpartum Women ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Program Appropriateness ', ' Public Health ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Support Groups ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Interaction ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Societies ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Emotional Stress ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' post-partum ', ' Postpartum ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Personality Traits ', ' satisfaction ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Smoker ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' social ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' relapse prevention ', ' recurrence prevention ', ' disorder recurrence prevention ', ' disease recurrence prevention ', ' disorder later incidence prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Childbirth ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' social communication ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' usability ', ' smoking intervention ', ' pregnant ', ' information processing ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' efficacy testing ', ' smoking relapse ', ' public health priorities ', ' peer support ', ' social media ', ' formative assessment ', ' formative evaluation ', ' community partnership ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ']",NCI,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R21,2016,194119,0.1360822972424939
"Reducing socioeconomic disparities in tobacco dependence treatment outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tobacco use is a leading contributor to racial and socioeconomic health disparities in the US primarily due to an unequal burden of tobacco-related disease from a disproportionate share of smokers in lower socioeconomic (SES) groups in which minorities, particularly African Americans, are disproportionately represented.1-5 Although deemed effective for all smokers,6 the standard cognitive-behavioral treatment for tobacco dependence is significantly less effective for lower SES smokers.7-15 Tobacco dependence treatment, however, has the potential to reduce racial and socioeconomic disparities in achieving long-term abstinence by proactively providing our most at-risk smokers with the specific treatment components they need to achieve abstinence through the existing extensive treatment delivery system.16, 17 Our preliminary studies indicate that in addition to several socio-cultural barriers to engaging in treatment,18 there are several key factors associated with socioeconomic disparities in relapse rates and thus treatment outcomes. These factors include: stress, negative affect, smoking in response to negative affect, delay discounting, locus of control, impulsiveness, exposure to smokers in the environment, and treatment utilization (see Table 1).19, 20 Based on this and other evidence, our overall goal is to revise the standard treatment with specific, evidence-based, cognitive-behavioral strategies to address these key factors as well as target and tailor the approach to more fully meet the needs of lower SES and minority smokers, thereby reducing treatment outcome disparities. We expect: 1) The revised treatment (RT) to reduce socioeconomic disparities in treatment outcomes, and 2) Participants treated with the RT to demonstrate more improvement on each of the key factors associated with disparities than those treated with standard treatment (ST). The specific aims include: 1) Complete a revised draft of a widely utilized standard treatment manual that addresses each of the key factors with treatment components. This aim is partially accomplished (see Appendix for preliminary draft). 2) Using the PEN-3 Model,21-23 target and tailor the daft RT to more fully represent the experiences of smokers who are of lower SES and /or of minority status, particularly African American smokers. 3) Pilot test the targeted/tailored draft RT with three treatment groups (n=5-10 per group) to assess understandability and acceptability and to ensure that it can be delivered in the same timeframe as the ST. 4) Compare the effects of SES on treatment outcomes with socioeconomically and racially diverse participants treated with ST (n=110) and RT (n=110) in a randomized treatment design. 5) Compare the effects of treatment condition on each of the key factors. This innovative approach refines, improves upon, and applies theoretically derived and empirically supported concepts and strategies. If effective at reducing treatment outcome disparities, the manual-driven RT will be easily disseminable as a ""new"" standard, having a sustained and powerful impact on the field and contributing to a reduction in the magnitude of the present tobacco-related racial and socioeconomic health disparities.           Tobacco use is a leading contributor to racial and socioeconomic health disparities in the US primarily due to an unequal burden of tobacco-related disease from a disproportionate share of smokers in African American and lower socioeconomic (SES) groups. Unlike many other health risk behaviors, tobacco-related health disparities are increasing despite a large treatment network of free telephone and in-person counseling services, perhaps due to significant disparities in treatment outcomes. The goal of this project is to revise the standard treatment for tobacco dependence to address key factors associated with treatment outcome disparities and more fully meet the needs of lower SES and African American smokers thereby reducing socioeconomic disparities in tobacco dependence treatment outcomes, halting the alarming increase in tobacco-related health disparities, and reducing a leading cause of racial and socioeconomic health disparities in the US.

"Unjust Targeting: How Marketing Features Impact Consumer Response and Tobacco Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research contributes to Tobacco Regulatory Science by connecting (1) tobacco marketing features with (2) consumer affective, cognitive and physiological response to marketing images and (3) tobacco product perceptions and use outcomes in ethnically diverse populations (African American, Asian American, Latino and non-Hispanic white). By identifying key features of tobacco marketing (e.g. colors, descriptors, branding, marketing claims) that optimize consumer response to the marketing and ultimately connecting that to tobacco use outcomes over time, this project adds to the evidence base used to regulate tobacco marketing. This project will provide a comprehensive description of the tobacco marketing landscape and an inventory of 'high impact' tobacco marketing features that produce inequitable outcomes in tobacco use. Additionally, by examining consumers' affective, cognitive and physiologic response to ads, this project will illuminate the underlying mechanisms through which these marketing features operate. The aims of this project are to: (1) describe key features of tobacco marketing targeted towards (a) African Americans, (b) Asian Americans, (c) Latinos (including Mexican Americans, Cubans and Puerto Ricans) and (d) non-Hispanic whites; (2) identify how marketing features impact response to ads for Latinos and Latino subgroups; and (3) for each ethnic group, demonstrate how tobacco product use is initiated and changes as a result of awareness of advertising and having a favorite ad and identify marketing features associated with tobacco product use. To accomplish these aims, the proposed research leverages the infrastructures of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study and the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), linking ad-level data from a PATH ad-hoc study that content codes tobacco marketing images with longitudinal PATH data and conducting an ancillary study to the HCHS/SOL assessing self-report and physiological response to tobacco ads. To execute these aims, I will work with a team of mentors who are internationally known scholars. Dr. John Elder, Professor in the Graduate School of Public Health at San Diego State University will be my primary mentor; Dr. John Pierce, Professor in the Department of Family & Preventive Medicine and Moores Cancer Center at UC-San Diego and a lead investigator on the PATH study and Dr. Lourdes Baezconde-Garbanati, Associate Professor of Preventive Medicine at the University of Southern California and Project Leader on the USC Tobacco Center of Regulatory Sciences (P50) will be secondary mentors. This training will provide me with expertise in longitudinal, epidemiological study design, management and analysis, tobacco use health disparities, tobacco regulatory policy and physiological measurement of ad response. This will facilitate my integration into the Tobacco Regulatory Science community and allow me to achieve my long-term career goal of becoming an independent, leading investigator and expert in Tobacco Regulatory Science with a specific focus on communication-based research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project impacts public health by providing knowledge necessary for the effective regulation of tobacco marketing. By linking specific features of tobacco marketing (e.g. colors, marketing claims, descriptors, branding) to consumers' response to ads and their tobacco product perceptions and use behaviors, this work provides the FDA with insight into how specifically tobacco marketing produces inequitable tobacco use outcomes. Ultimately, this will facilitate tobacco marketing regulations that will result in lower rates of tobacco use and disease and death associated with tobacco use.",Unjust Targeting: How Marketing Features Impact Consumer Response and Tobacco Use,9316810,K01DA037903,"['Advertising ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Archives ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' family medicine ', ' Family Practice ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Market Research ', ' Marketing ', ' Mentors ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Perception ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' RQ2 ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Central American ', ' Policies ', ' Research Activity ', ' Measurement ', ' Descriptor ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' South American ', ' Pattern ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' preference ', ' professor ', ' skills ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' risk perception ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dominican ', ' p50 ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily Member 5 Gene ', ' TNFRSF5 ', ' MGC9013 ', ' CDW40 ', ' CD40 ', ' Bp50 ', ' TNFRSF5 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Tobacco Epidemiology ', ' Tobacco Use Epidemiology ', ' Characteristics ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Affective ', ' evidence base ', ' population health ', ' arm ', ' health data ', ' mid-career faculty ', ' associate professor ', ' associate faculty ', ' Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos ', ' HCHS/SOL cohort ', ' HCHS/SOL Study ', ' Study of Latinos ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' Cuban ', ' ']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,82166,0.11660224081716487
"In Vivo Experience with NRT to Increase Adherence and Smoking Abstinence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking remains the leading cause of death and disability in the United States, resulting in death for 1 out of every 2 smokers. While smoking rates have declined to about 18% among the general population, smoking rates still remain disproportionately high among individuals in the criminal justice system (i.e., 70-80%). Despite this high rate of smoking, few interventions have been tested in this population. We were the first to investigate providing 12 weeks of bupropion to a sample of community corrections smokers and then randomizing them to either four sessions of smoking cessation counseling or no counseling to quit. No significant differences were found between our two groups, indicating no additional benefit from more intensive smoking cessation counseling. However, while only 5.8% were abstinent at the 6 month follow-up, abstinence rates were quadrupled among the minority of those who were adherent to medication. Developing interventions to increase medication adherence has been cited as the most important means to reducing disparities; however, the few interventions that have investigated increasing adherence have been psychoeducational only and have yielded poor results. But evidence from our previous work demonstrated that smokers who had previous experience using bupropion had higher subsequent cessation rates and this relationship was mediated by improved medication adherence. Thus, exposure to medication is very likely the critical factor in improving subsequent adherence. The current application proposes a randomized controlled trial to maximize medication adherence with this population of smokers by testing an In Vivo NRT experiential intervention. Participants randomized to the In Vivo intervention will try a nicotine patch in Session 1, try nicotine gum in Session 2, try combination nicotine replacement therapy (cNRT) in Session 3, and discuss any problems with use of cNRT for a quit attempt in Session 4. During each 30-minute session they will discuss their expectations for the medication as well as the In Vivo session effects of these medications on withdrawal symptomatology, including urge to smoke. Between sessions, participants will be given medication to use during that week to make practice quit attempts and to become familiar with the medication. Participants randomized to the control group will receive four 30-minute sessions of standard behavioral counseling. All participants will receive cNRT for 10 weeks. Follow-ups will occur up to six months post-intervention. Primary outcomes include 6 month point prevalence abstinence and abstinence across time as well as medication adherence. If successful, this intervention could provide an easily transportable, novel, and tailored intervention to increase medication adherence and improve smoking cessation rates among smokers in the criminal justice system to reduce health disparities and save lives.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Smoking is now concentrated in high risk and disadvantaged populations such as individuals in the criminal justice system. Novel intervention strategies have the potential to reduce the smoking rates and health disparities in a population with high rates of smoking but little access to traditional smoking cessation interventions.                    ",In Vivo Experience with NRT to Increase Adherence and Smoking Abstinence,9127430,R01DA039678,"['Cause of Death ', ' Charge ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Bupropion ', ' buproprion ', ' Wellbutrin ', ' Amfebutamone ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Mediating ', ' Withdrawal Symptom ', ' improved ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Legal Status ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' nicotine patch ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' nicotine gum ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Adherence ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' post intervention ', ' Instruction ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Expectancy ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Abstinence ', ' treatment effect ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' psychoeducational ', ' smoking intervention ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' successful intervention ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' symptomatology ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2016,513930,0.19500105391465386
"Understanding Disparities in Quitting in African American and White Smokers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial/ethnic differences in smoking are well documented; African Americans smoke fewer cigarettes per day than Whites but experience disproportionately greater smoking attributable morbidity and mortality. Well documented disparities also exist in smoking cessation with African Americans consistently quitting at lower rates than Whites. However, to-date, no adequately powered study, stratified on race, has been conducted to confirm this finding using a rigorous study design or to understand the mechanisms accounting for differential quit rates in African Americans relative to Whites. The objectives of this application are to 1) describe the differences in smoking cessation among AA and White smokers treated with varenicline, 2) identify the smoking, psychosocial, treatment process, and biological factors that independently explain the relationship between race/ethnicity and cotinine-verified 7-day abstinence in African American and White smokers, and 3) examine the side effect profile of varenicline by smoking level. These aims will be accomplished through a prospective cohort intervention study, stratified on race, age (< 40, > 40), and gender among 448 participants (224 African American, 224 White). All participants will receive 3 months of varenicline, the most effective of currently available smoking cessation medications, standard educational materials, and six sessions of smoking cessation counseling. This study is innovative. It will be the first known study to report on the use of varenicline in As, the first to examine varenicline in light smokers (<10 cpd) and among a wide range of smoking levels (3-20 cpd), the first head-to-head study, stratified on race, designed to prospectively compare pharmacotherapy in AAs versus Whites, and one of a few to explore mechanisms underlying disparities in quitting between AA and White smokers. The impact of these findings will be considerable, having ramifications for treatment, clinical practice, and policy. Significan knowledge will be gained about African American-White differences in quitting. Findings have the potential to improve tobacco use treatment by moving the field away from a generic focus on race/ethnicity toward a targeted focus on modifiable smoking, psychosocial, and treatment process factors most relevant to African Americans and to Whites. African Americans smoking fewer cigarettes per day and experience greater smoking-related disease and death, yet consistently quit smoking at lower rates than Whites. Little is known about the reasons for this disparity. This study will examine mechanisms explaining lower quit rates in African Americans relative to Whites and has the potential to significantly improve tobacco use treatment outcomes by identifying specific barriers and facilitators to quitting smoking for African Americans and for Whites.",Understanding Disparities in Quitting in African American and White Smokers,9277607,R01DA031815,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Scotine ', ' Cotinine ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Menthol ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Nicotine ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Tobacco ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Bupropion ', ' buproprion ', ' Wellbutrin ', ' Amfebutamone ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' improved ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Smoker ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' nicotine patch ', ' Knowledge ', ' psychosocial ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' experience ', ' nicotine gum ', ' cohort ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' Participant ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Intake ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' varenicline ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,61200,0.299361504356116
"Expanding the Reach of a Validated Smoking-Cessation Intervention: A Spanish-language RCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco smoking is the leading preventable cause of cancer mortality. Pharmacotherapy and behavioral counseling have demonstrated independent and additive effects toward aiding smoking cessation; however, counseling is rarely chosen by smokers. In contrast, minimal self-help interventions, such as smoking cessation pamphlets or booklets have much wider potential reach, yet their efficacy has been largely disappointing, with incremental abstinence rates averaging only 1 percent. Given the high dissemination potential, any significant improvement in the efficacy of self-help would have high public health impact with respect to smoking and smoking related illness and mortality. In contrast to traditional self-help, a notable exception to the historically poor efficacy of self-help has been extended self-help that provides evidence-based content over a prolonged period of time. A recently completed trial of such an intervention, comprising 18 months of contact with a written social support component, revealed high efficacy throughout the 24-month follow-up period, as well as high cost- effectiveness. Wide-scale implementation and public health impact would be enhanced by the availability of a Spanish-language version to reach the largest and fastest growing ethnic minority population of smokers. The current smoking prevalence among Hispanic/Latino adults varies by cultural subgroup, with prevalence above 30 percent, for example, among those of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent. Greater smoking prevalence is also associated with lower income and education, and greater US acculturation. Prior research has demonstrated that Hispanic/Latino smokers face unique challenges such as lower awareness and acceptability of pharmacotherapies and less assistance with smoking cessation from their health providers. The goal of this study is to address this gap in cessation by conducting a randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of a culturally appropriate Spanish-language version of the existing validated self-help intervention. The efficacy of this intervention will be tested against two control conditions. The first, Usual Care, will consist of a traditional self-help intervention in Spanish. The second, Contact Control, will match the novel intervention on time and contact. These two control conditions address external and internal validity, respectively. It is hypothesized that, compared to both the Usual Care and the Contact Control conditions, the intervention will produce higher abstinence rates throughout 24 months of outcome assessment. Potential moderator variables will be evaluated to guide further refinement and targeting of the intervention. This would be the first study to test a Spanish-language adaptation of a validated self-help smoking cessation intervention in a nation-wide RCT. If efficacy is demonstrated in this study, a low-cost, easily disseminated, evidence-based intervention would be available, with the potential to reduce ethnic health disparities associated with tobacco smoking.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Research is needed to develop and validate interventions for ethnic minority smokers. The aim of the proposed study is to test a Spanish-language adaptation of a validated and easily implemented self-help intervention in a nation-wide clinical trial.

"Impact of Retail Tobacco Advertising on Youth Smoking ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Flavored tobacco products are cheap, sweet, and appealing to youth. The Federal Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act banned flavored cigarettes other than menthol in 2009, but little cigars and cigarillos (referred to as small cigar) are still sold in a variety of fruit, sweet, and alcohol/cocktail flavors. Electronic cigarettes ar sold in more than 7,500 flavors, including Juicy Peach, Very Vanilla, and Tutti Frutti Gumballs. In addition, retail marketing of small cigars and e-cigarettes as low-cost alternatives to cigarette smoking likely contributes to their growing popularity among adolescents. This proposal seeks continued funding to better understand the impact of retail tobacco marketing on adolescent tobacco use, with a change in focus from studying cigarettes to cigarette substitutes/complements. Specifically, this longitudinal study aims to: (1) test whether adolescents' exposure to retail marketing for flavored small cigars and e-cigarettes is associated with higher odds of past-month and ever use of these products at two timepoints; (2) examine how promotion and price of flavored small cigars and e-cigarettes change over time and as a function of student demography at nearby schools and the proportion of school-age residents in the neighborhood; (3) characterize the strength of local tobacco retailer licensing and test whether stronger licensing predicts higher prices for flavored products; and (4) disseminate research results to federal, state and local stakeholders concerned with regulating tobacco products and marketing. To accomplish these aims, data about adolescents' use of small cigars and e- cigarettes will be obtained from the California Student Tobacco Survey (CSTS), a biennial surveillance survey conducted for the California Tobacco Control Program (in academic years 2015-16 and 2017-18). Each administration of the CSTS will yield responses from approximately 25,000 students (grades 6-12) attending 140 schools that are stratified by region. In conjunction with the CSTS surveys, trained observers will assess the availability, placement, promotion and price of flavored small cigars and e-cigarettes in a random sample of 500 licensed tobacco retailers within walking distance of the surveyed schools. The proximity of tobacco retailers to schools will be determined using a GIS dataset of campus boundary files that better reflects the school environment than previous methods. Multilevel modeling will test whether greater promotion and lower prices of flavored small cigars and e-cigarettes is associated with higher odds of current and ever use by students at nearby schools, adjusting for both individual-level characteristics and school-level demographics. The proposed research would inform tobacco control policy and regulatory science by advancing our understanding of the health risks associated with the retail availability and promotion of flavored tobacco products near schools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While the prevalence of cigarette smoking has declined among adolescents, use of electronic cigarettes has tripled in three years, and use of little cigars and cigarillos is increasing, particularly among African American youth. Our previous research found more advertising and lower prices for menthol cigarettes at stores near schools with more African American students, and identified exposure to retail marketing as a risk factor smoking initiation. To inform tobacco control policy and regulatory science of flavored tobacco products, the proposed research will test parallel hypotheses about the retail availability and promotion of flavored little cigars/cigarillos and e-cigarettes near schools and its impact on adolescent use of these products.",Impact of Retail Tobacco Advertising on Youth Smoking,9110228,R01CA067850,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Advertising ', ' Age ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' California ', ' Confection ', ' Candy ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Demography ', ' Environment ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Fruit ', ' Health ', ' Heating ', ' Household ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Marketing ', ' Menthol ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nicotine ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Perception ', ' Propanediols ', ' Propylene Glycols ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sales ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' Wales ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Walking ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Licensing ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Flavoring Agents ', ' Flavoring ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' Cigarette ', ' Cigar ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Reporting ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Advertisements ', ' Peach ', ' Vanilla ', ' Genus Vanilla ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cigar Smoking ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Smoking Prevention ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' tobacco control ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' tobacco use prevention ', ' prevent tobacco use ', ' tobacco prevention ', ' cost ', ' adolescent smoking ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' demographics ', ' surveillance data ', ' never smoker ', ' Middle School Student ', ' Junior High Student ', ' Junior High School Student ', ' High School Student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' e-cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' African American student ', ' black student ', ' ']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,316000,0.10409685999056667
"Gain-framed Messages and NRT Sampling to Promote Smoking Cessation in Lung Cancer Screening Programs PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lung cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in the U.S. In addition to primary prevention (tobacco control), secondary prevention through early detection with low-dose CT scans is recognized as a technique to identify earlier stage, more treatable lung cancers in high-risk patients. Evidence from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that lung cancer screening with low-dose CT scans for high risk individuals (>30 pack years of smoking, <15 yr quit-time, and 55-74 yrs of age) conferred a 20% reduction in mortality for those patients who received 3 annual low dose CT scans. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently issued a final recommendation for annual screening for lung cancer in these high risk individuals, and many insurers now cover the screening. The present study is thus timely and novel – we will investigate whether we can achieve higher rates of short- and long-term cessation in this high risk population. We will conduct a 2 x 2 (gain-framed intervention vs. unframed intervention, starter package of 2 weeks of nicotine patches and lozenges vs. no medication) study to evaluation methods to boost rates of smoking cessation for a high-risk group of smokers (N=616) with varying levels of motivation across 2 study sites (MUSC, Yale). Participants will be identified through the MUSC and Yale lung cancer screening programs at both sites. Randomization will be stratified by study site and level of motivation. The primary hypothesis is that rates of smoking cessation will be significantly higher at 6-months after lung screening for the smoking cessation strategy involving a gain-framed intervention + 2 weeks of nicotine patches and lozenges compared to a strategy of an unframed behavioral intervention + no medication. Our secondary hypothesis is that rates of smoking cessation will be higher for the gain-framed intervention group vs. the unframed intervention group and the starter package of 2 weeks of nicotine patches and lozenges group vs. the no medication group. On an exploratory basis we will also examine mediators and moderators of treatment. We hypothesize that changes in self-efficacy, smoking cessation outcome expectancy, familiarization with NRT, motivation, and autonomy will act as mechanisms for the smoking cessation effects (i.e., will act as mediators of treatment). We also hypothesize that lung screening findings (e.g., presence of a nodule, cancer, etc), nicotine dependence, and health disparities will modify treatment response (i.e., will act as baseline moderators of treatment). This project is designed to be translational (in that it can be transferable from our controlled efficacy study to other lung screening programs at other institutions) as all of our media will be digital files ready for sharing, the procedures for NRT sampling will be easily copied, and the print materials can be provided as fillable templates for personalization. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recently approved annual lung cancer screening as a benefit for individuals: (1) ages 55-77 years old; (2) asymptomatic (no signs of lung cancer illness); (3) tobacco smoking history of at least 30 pack-years; and (4) report current smoking or quit smoking within the past 15 years. While one might hypothesize that simply having a CT scan may promote cessation, evidence suggests that having a scan increases quit rates only slightly, if there is any increase at all. Most patients presenting for screening will have variable motivation to quit smoking, with many of them lacking motivation to quit. Studying smoking cessation interventions in the context of lung cancer screening has the potential to improve cessation rates for this high-risk group of smokers.",Gain-framed Messages and NRT Sampling to Promote Smoking Cessation in Lung Cancer Screening Programs,9162164,R01CA207229,"['catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer early detection ', ' Lung Cancer screening ', ' Screening for Lung Cancer ', ' Staging ', ' Smoker ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' nicotine patch ', ' programs ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Adherence ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Low dose CT ', ' Low-Dose Spiral CT ', ' beneficiary ', ' tobacco control ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' treatment effect ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' high risk ', ' group intervention ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' screening ', ' treatment group ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' Age ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Elements ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Insurers ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Nodule ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Printing ', ' Recommendation ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' Smoking ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' ']",NCI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2016,611518,0.2175451531997429
"A mobile intervention to promote cessation in HIV-infected smokers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are nearly one million persons living with confirmed HIV infection (PLWH) in the US, 60% of them smoke cigarettes, and 75% of them are interested in quitting. Almost none are currently accessing smoking cessation interventions designed to meet their specific needs and concerns.  Cigarette smoking is a leading contributor to mortality among PLWH in the HAART era, and it is the direct cause of 30% of non-AIDS defining malignancies. It is driving the alarming rise in cardiac events and lung cancers in this highly vulnerable population. The lack of access to proven, effective, culturally appropriate tobacco cessation services represents a health disparity of the first order. The psychosocial profile of the PLWH-smoker community, characterized by high rates of psychiatric comorbidity, drug and alcohol use, and low levels of social support, suggests that achieving high cessation rates will be a great challenge.  Positively Smoke Free is an intensive, multisession, cessation intervention specifically developed for PLWH smokers. It is currently available as a live, group therapy program and also as a web-based version designed for notebook or desktop computers. In its current form, the web-version is not adoptable to the smartphone platform. Pilot data from randomized, controlled, trials of both formats show promise.  The number of individuals in the US who own smartphones and who use them to access health information on the internet is steadily growing. This growth is most pronounced in the ethnic minority groups that make up the majority of the PLWH community in the US. Behavioral interventions delivered via smartphones offer the advantage of expansive reach, low cost, and immediacy of access to users. A burgeoning body of literature suggests that this may be an especially effective tool for tobacco treatment. mHealth tobacco treatment interventions for PLWH smokers have not yet been explored.  This proposal aims (1) to adapt Positively Smoke Free to the mobile format for smartphones (2) to test the feasibility (i.e. recruitment, adherence, retention, satisfaction, and cost) of mobile Positively Smoke Free (mPSF) in a cohort of 50 PLWH smokers, (3) to complete a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing biochemically confirmed 3-month abstinence rates in subjects (N=50) assigned to the mPSF condition versus those (N=50) assigned to standard care (all subjects will be offered a 3-month supply of nicotine replacement therapy) and (4) to conduct exploratory analyses of putative moderators and mediators of program efficacy.  If the mobile version of PSF is proven to be feasible and efficacious, the project will have short term impact by opening a new vista of tobacco (and other behavioral) treatment for a highly vulnerable group. Study data will provide crucial information for a definitive trial of the intervention. The long-term impact will be reduced tobacco-related morbidity and mortality among PLWH, and a clearer understanding of the role of mHealth in comprehensive HIV care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic of cigarette smoking is fueling an alarming rise in cardiovascular disease and tobacco-related cancers in persons living with HIV. Smokers living with HIV have few, if any, cessation resources available to them that address their particular needs, and HIV care providers have virtually no evidence-base to guide their approach to tobacco treatment. The proposal, if funded, will attempt to address this major public health issue by using mobile-web and smartphone technology to expand the reach of a promising, tailored cessation intervention.",A mobile intervention to promote cessation in HIV-infected smokers,9056549,R34DA037042,"['etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Computers ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Literature ', ' Marketing ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Web-based Smoking Cessation Program for Tribal College Students DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  American Indian tribal college students have the highest smoking rates of any racial/ethnic group in the young adult population and also are disproportionately burdened by smoking-related morbidity and mortality. There are very few effective culturally-tailored smoking cessation programs for AI smokers. Our research group has worked with the American Indian community for the past 8 years to develop a culturally-tailored smoking cessation program (All Nations Breath of Life - ANBL), for AI adult smokers. All Nations Breath of Life was developed using the community-based participatory research approach and is an in-person group based program that incorporates cultural issues throughout the program. We have produced 30% cessation rates at 6-month follow-up with adult American Indian smokers from tribes and nations in the Midwest. Due to limited studies with the tribal college population, we have already conducted a cross-sectional internet-based survey to collect information on their smoking behaviors as well as other health behaviors. This research experience and strong collaboration with the AI community leaves us well poised to adapt the ANBL program for the tribal college smoking population. However, this current program needs substantial modifications to meet the unique needs of the tribal college student population. It recognizes the sacred role of tobacco among many American Indians and how culture affects smoking cessation among AIs, while still addressing recreational smoking. However, preliminary data from our recent studies indicate that the internet may be more favorable and appropriate delivery method for reaching this younger and more mobile tribal college population due to the web interactivity, immediacy of feedback, and wide reach and accessibility. This current proposal reflects a natural progression to addressing the significant problem of smoking among tribal college students using our successful methods. In this study, we will adapt and test a culturally tailored internet-based smoking cessation (I-ANBL) program based on ANBL, which was developed through CBPR methods. For the current proposal, we will conduct an individual randomized controlled trial (N=242) to test the effectiveness of an internet-based culturally-tailored smoking cessation program (I-ANBL) in a tribal college student population. Data will be collected at baseline, 3 months and 6 months using salivary cotinine, as well as comprehensive set of environmental and psychosocial measures. We hypothesize that AI tribal college students randomized to the culturally-tailored smoking cessation internet arm (I-ANBL) will have significantly higher continuous abstinence rates at 6 months than those receiving the heart healthy diet intervention (I-FV), focusing on increasing fruit and vegetable consumption. We will also examine the costs of delivering the tailored intervention program and potential mediators and moderators of the intervention-cessation relationship. Such a high-reach, low-cost strategy for promoting smoking cessation in this at-risk and underserved population could have great potential for adoption on a larger scale and thus help reduce existing health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  American Indians (AI) have the highest rates of cigarette smoking of any major racial/ethnic group in the US, approaching 40% to 50%. Despite the overall decline in adult smoking prevalence during the past several decades, the young adult (18-29 year olds) age group has the highest prevalence of smoking.

"Implementing tobacco use treatment guidelines in dental public health clinics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. The 2008 Public Health Service Guideline (PHS), Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence provides strong evidence that brief advice combined with assistance such as counseling and pharmacotherapy, can significantly increase quit rates. Unfortunately, provider adherence to Guideline recommendations is poor. Inadequate implementation of the Guideline in practice settings, particularly those serving ethnic minorities and other vulnerable populations, has contributed to growing disparities in smoking prevalence and tobacco-related illness. This proposal addresses this research-to-practice gap by examining the effectiveness of three practical and highly replicable strategies for implementing evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of tobacco dependence in dental public health clinics. Dental providers have a credible and central role in providing tobacco cessation services. The majority of smokers see a dentist annually and tobacco use is a known risk factor for oral disease. Moreover, controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy and effectiveness of dental office-based cessation interventions. Yet dental care settings remain a relatively untapped venue for the treatment of tobacco dependence. In order to integrate evidence-based tobacco cessation treatment into routine dental practice, optimal implementation processes and strategies must be identified. We propose a 3-arm, cluster randomized controlled trial that will 1) Compare the effectiveness and cost of three promising strategies for implementation of the PHS tobacco use treatment guidelines: a) Staff training and current best practices (CBP); 2) CBP + provider performance feedback (PF) and 3) CBP + PF + provider reimbursement for delivery of tobacco cessation treatment (pay for performance) on provider adherence to recommended guidelines for tobacco use treatment; 2) Use a mixed-methods approach to examine potential theory-driven mechanisms at the organizational and provider level hypothesized to explain the comparative effectiveness of three strategies for implementation; and 3) Identify baseline organizational factors that influence the implementation of evidence-based tobacco use treatment practices in dental clinics. The trial will be conducted in 18 public dental care clinics and information about implementation outcomes and processes will be derived from multiple data sources (patient exit interviews, provider surveys and semi- structured interviews). Guided by a conceptual framework that emphasizes provider beliefs and organizational characteristics, we will identify factors that influence the implementation process in dental clinics. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to provide critical new knowledge to facilitate the widespread adoption, implementation, dissemination and sustained utilization of evidence-based tobacco use treatment strategies in dental practices across the U.S. ",Implementing tobacco use treatment guidelines in dental public health clinics,9039002,R01CA162035,"['Adoption ', ' Belief ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Sources ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' Dental Clinics ', ' Dental Offices ', ' Dentists ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Feedback ', ' dental practice ', ' Dental General Practice ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' mouth disorder ', ' Oral Disorder ', ' Oral Disease ', ' Oral Cavity Disorder ', ' Oral Cavity Disease ', ' Mouth Diseases ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoking ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Tobacco ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' United States ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' Reminder Systems ', ' Process Measure ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Structure ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' effectiveness research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' provider intervention ', ' research to practice ', ' research into practice ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' financial incentive ', ' brief advice ', ' arm ', ' trial design ', ' ']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2016,603479,0.08077871866484744
"Telephone-Delivered Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Smoking Cessation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Smoking cessation telephone quit lines (QLs), available in all 50 states; now serve over 500,000 smokers each year. On average, only 14% (range: 8% to 20%) of QL callers stop smoking by the 12 month follow-up even with the aid of traditional Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) combined with pharmacotherapy (typically nicotine replacement therapy; NRT). The low quit rates of QLs stifle their great potential public health impact. To address the low quit rate problem, and thereby start a new research paradigm focused on innovative QL behavioral intervention content, we propose to test a novel counseling approach, called Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), as a telephone-delivered quit smoking intervention. We recently completed a small (N = 121) NIDA R21 pilot randomized QL trial of proactively-delivered ACT vs. CBT in state QL callers that was underpowered due to R21 budget limits. Results showed that ACT: (1) was feasible to implement and evaluate in a state QL context, (2) had higher participant engagement and satisfaction than CBT, (3) had higher levels of acceptance of cravings than CBT, which in turn predicted quitting smoking, and (4) had higher (albeit non-significant) 6-month post randomization quit rates than CBT. Building on these promising and non- definitive results, a comparative effectiveness randomized trial with a large and fully-powered sample size (N = 1168) and longer term follow-up (i.e., 12 months) is now needed to definitively determine whether telephone- delivered ACT: (1) provides higher quit rates than CBT, (2) operates according to its theory-based mechanisms, and (3) is more cost-effective than CBT. Accordingly, we propose to conduct a randomized comparative effectiveness trial of telephone-delivered ACT counseling plus NRT (n=584) versus telephone-delivered traditional CBT counseling plus NRT (n=584) in state quit line callers, in order to demonstrate that telephone-delivered ACT: (1) has significantly higher 30-day point prevalence abstinence at 12 months post-randomization than telephone-delivered traditional CBT; (2) has smoking cessation outcomes significantly mediated by three psychological processes central to the theoretical model underlying ACT: acceptance of internal (a) sensations, (b) emotions, and (c) thoughts that cue smoking; (3) Will be significantly more cost-effective than telephone-delivered CBT, as measured by cost per additional quitter, incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER), and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The study, well-motivated by preliminary results, shows exciting promise for improving the success rates of quit lines and thereby lowering healthcare costs and reducing premature tobacco-related deaths. If shown to be efficacious and cost-effective, ACT would provide the scientific field a new conceptual model of QL intervention and quit lines a new treatment approach that could help 45,000 more (of the 500,000) quit line callers to stop smoking each year, thereby saving in medical costs and prolonging lives. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Smoking cessation telephone quit lines (QLs), available in all 50 states; now serve over 500,000 smokers each year. This randomized trial will definitively test a telephone-delivered Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT) intervention for adult smoking cessation.

"Financial Incentives for Smoking Cessation Among Disadvantaged Pregnant Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking during pregnancy is the leading preventable cause of poor pregnancy outcomes in the U.S.  Most pregnant smokers continue smoking through pregnancy producing serious immediate and longer-term adverse health consequences for the infant.    Smoking during pregnancy is highly associated  with  economic  disadvantage and a substantive contributor to health disparities.     Efficacious  interventions  are  available  but  cessation  rates  are  low  (<20 percent)  and  improvements  in  birth  outcomes often modest or absent.  Current treatments usually entail relatively brief, low-cost interventions (e.g. pregnancy-specific quit lines).  There is broad consensus that more effective interventions are sorely needed.    We  have  developed  a  novel  behavioral-economic  intervention  in  which  women  earn  financial  incentives contingent on smoking abstinence.  In a meta-analysis of treatments for smoking during pregnancy, effect sizes achieved with financial incentives were several-fold larger than those achieved with lower-intensity approaches or medications.    The  intervention  also  appears  to  improve  birth  outcomes  and  increase  breastfeeding duration.  While highly promising, further research is needed in at least three areas.  (1) The evidence on birth outcomes and breastfeeding is from studies that combined data across trials rather than a single prospective trial, (2) whether the intervention produces other postpartum improvements in health has not been investigated, and (3) the overall cost-effectiveness of this approach has not been examined.    To  examine  these  unanswered  questions,  we  are  proposing  a  randomized,  controlled  clinical  trial  comparing  the  efficacy  and  cost  effectiveness  throuh  one-year  postpartum  of  current  best  practices  for  smoking-cessation  during  pregnancy  vs.  best  practices  plus  financial  incentives  among  230  pregnant,  Medicaid  recipients.   We  will  also  include  a  third  condition  of  115  pregnant  non-smokers  matched  to  the  smokers on socio-demographic and health conditions to compare the extent to which the treatments reduce  the burden of smoking and to estimate how much more might be accomplished by further improvements in this  incentives intervention without exceeding cost-effectiveness.  We hypothesize that best practices plus financial  incentives will be more effective than best practices alone, that the incentives intervention will be cost effective,  and  that  while  adding the  incentives  reduces  a  greater  proportion  of  the  health  and  economic  burden  of  smoking than best practices alone, more can be done while remaining cost effective.     Overall, the proposed study has the potential to substantially advance knowledge on cost-effective smoking cessation for pregnant women.    Importantly,  because  of  the  strong  association  between  smoking  during  pregnancy  and  economic  disadvantage,  the  proposed  study  also  has  the  potential  to  contribute  new  knowledge relevant to reducing the serious challenges of health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We  will  examine  whether  adding  financial  incentives  to  current  best  practices  for  smoking  cessation  during  pregnancy  (i.e.,  counseling  using  a  telephone  quit-line)  increases cessation rates and improves infant health.  While more expensive upfront,  this  treatment  approach  may  be  economically  justified  by  the  later  cost  savings  associated  with  more  women  quitting,  having  healthier  babies,  and  needing  less  healthcare.  It should also help to reduce the greater risk for health problems often seen among those who less well off economically.",Financial Incentives for Smoking Cessation Among Disadvantaged Pregnant Women,9081629,R01HD075669,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Breastfeeding ', ' Breast Feeding ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Femur ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Gestational Age ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Hospital Records ', ' Incentives ', ' Infant ', ' low birthweight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birth weight ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' Medicaid ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy Complications ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' pregnancy care ', ' Prenatal care ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Illness Behavior ', ' Sick Role ', ' Smoking ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Woman ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' post-partum ', ' Postpartum ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Infant Health ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Policies ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Smoker ', ' nonsmoker ', ' Non-smoker ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' Visit ', ' infantile death ', ' infant demise ', ' death in first year of life ', ' infant death ', ' meetings ', ' novel ', ' Controlled Study ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' Reporting ', ' intrauterine growth ', ' Fetal Growth ', ' Fetal Body Weight ', ' Fetal Weight ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Smoking Status ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' tobacco use in pregnancy ', ' prenatally tobacco exposed ', ' prenatal tobacco exposure ', ' prenatal nicotine exposure ', ' prenatal cigarette smoking ', ' pregnant smoker ', ' pregnant cigarette smoker ', ' nicotine use in pregnancy ', ' Prenatal Tobacco Smoke ', ' Gestational cigarette smoke exposure ', ' Fetal Smoke Exposure ', ' fetal tobacco exposure ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' prospective ', ' Abstinence ', ' infant outcome ', ' trial comparing ', ' non-smoking ', ' high risk ', ' pregnant ', ' control trial ', ' effective intervention ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' financial incentive ', ' behavioral economics ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2016,729020,0.1482375636714988
"Using Mobile Technology to Understand and Encourage Mindfulness for Smoking Cessa DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Although most smokers indicate interest in quitting, only 6% quit each year. Mindfulness-based interventions show promise for improving smoking cessation; however, underlying mechanisms are unclear. Furthermore, there is a dearth of research on mindfulness and smoking cessation in underserved populations (i.e., members of racial/ethnic minority groups and individuals with low socioeconomic status [SES]), who often have greater difficulty quitting smoking and experience profound tobacco-related health disparities. Mobile health technology (""mHealth"") is revolutionizing healthcare and might be used to elucidate mechanisms underlying mindfulness and enhance mindfulness-based interventions for smoking cessation.  Claire Adams, Ph.D., an Assistant Professor of Psychology at the Catholic University of America (CUA), is seeking five years of support through the K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award for training and research related to mindfulness, mHealth, advanced statistics, and health disparities research. Dr. Adams' overarching career goals are to inform, develop, evaluate, and disseminate mindfulness- based interventions to promote smoking cessation, prevent cancer and other chronic diseases, and enhance well-being in diverse populations. Through the proposed training plan, Dr. Adams will expand her knowledge and skills with regard to mindfulness, smoking cessation, and health disparities research. In order to fill important gaps in her experience thus far, she will gain specialized training related to mHealth and the advanced statistics necessary for analyzing multi-level and longitudinal data. Dr. Adams will work with her mentoring team (led by Dr. David Wetter and comprising experts in fields of psychology, engineering, public health, and biostatistics) to complete formal coursework, specialized workshops, and directed readings.  Primary research aims are to: 1) utilize advanced statistics and mHealth technology to determine mechanisms through which mindfulness influences smoking cessation, and 2) design and test the feasibility of a mHealth-enhanced mindfulness-based intervention for smoking cessation. Toward the first aim, Dr. Adams will learn and apply advanced multilevel modeling techniques to determine mechanisms underlying mindfulness and smoking cessation in three existing datasets that include diverse samples of smokers. Toward the second aim, Dr. Adams will work with her mentoring team to develop and test the feasibility of a mindfulness-based smoking cessation treatment that is supplemented by between-session text messaging. This program aims to deliver personalized intervention to participants in their natural environments and in the moments when they might benefit most. Findings from this feasibility study will inform and provide pilot data for an R01 application of a larger randomized controlled trial. Dr. Adams will conduct the proposed work at CUA, which will provide space, time, equipment, and other resources for research and training.  The proposed research will be the first known to use mobile technology to examine mechanisms underlying mindfulness and smoking, as well as the first known study to use text messaging to enhance mindfulness- based smoking cessation. Furthermore, all proposed studies will target racially/ethnically diverse and low-SES populations (who are at disproportionate risk for tobacco-related health disparities and have not typically served as participants in mindfulness research). Research findings could be critical in moving forward the scientific study of mindfulness, improving patient outcomes in smoking cessation interventions, preventing cancer and other chronic diseases, and improving quality of life in diverse and underserved populations. The proposed training and research plan would launch Dr. Adams as an independent clinical scientist who conducts multidisciplinary research to inform, develop, evaluate, and disseminate innovative mindfulness- based interventions to improve health in diverse populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S., and mindfulness-based interventions show promise for improving smoking cessation. However, the mechanisms through which mindfulness impacts smoking are poorly understood. Approaches capitalizing on mobile health technology could be critical for increasing our understanding of mindfulness and improving mindfulness-based interventions to promote smoking cessation, prevent chronic disease, and enhance quality of life in diverse populations.",Using Mobile Technology to Understand and Encourage Mindfulness for Smoking Cessa,9278327,K23AT008442,"['post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Americas ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Engineering Psychology ', ' Environment ', ' Equipment ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Reading ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Smoking ', ' statistics ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Treatment Effectiveness ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Attenuated ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Techniques ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Cessation Research ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Text ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Affective ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' mindfulness ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' personalized intervention ', ' precision interventions ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' hands-on learning ', ' interactive learning ', ' interactive engagement ', ' applied learning ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' mindfulness intervention ', ' mindfulness-based intervention ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' ']",NCCIH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,K23,2016,125433,0.29435682992039836
"Exposure to flavored tobacco advertising and associations with future use in young adults: implications for health equity PROJECT SUMMARY A potential ban on flavored tobacco products is a policy option to reduce tobacco product initiation by youth and young adults. However, few studies examine its potential to reduce disparities in vulnerable populations due to tobacco advertising exposure, perceptions of flavored products, and differential use. The purpose of this study is to address how targeted marketing of FTPs may influence perceptions of, susceptibility to and initiation of tobacco in a vulnerable population (recruited from 3 wards within Washington, DC with the highest smoking rates, % African American, and lowest SES) (VP) vs. a non-vulnerable population (non-VP) of young adults in Washington, DC. It will address the potential of a policy ban or restrictions on flavored tobacco products to reduce tobacco and, ultimately, cancer disparities and enhance equity in the distribution of tobacco marketing risk. The current study will build on the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), a model of cognitive processing of how advertising results in persuasion. The ELM suggests that one way tobacco advertising works is by linking tobacco to `peripheral cues,' positive attributes including flavoring that may contribute to positive appraisal and lower harm perceptions of flavored products. Across a sample of n = 256 VP and non-VP young adult non-tobacco users, this multi-level study (store- and individual-level) will build on the ELM to examine differences in real-world exposure to FTP advertising, emphasizing point of sale (POS) exposure, using 14 days of ecological momentary assessment (EMA). It will examine the influence of exposure on self-reported perceptions of FTPs (lower harm, more appeal). Participants will be assessed at 2-weeks and 6- months post-baseline to examine differential impacts of FTP advertising and attitudes on susceptibility, intentions, and tobacco use patterns (for FTPs and non-FTPs) as a function of VP group status. POS exposure will be validated by photographs of tobacco advertising in stores visited by respondents. Our specific aims are to (1) Identify the frequency of FTP and non-FTP advertising, and number and types of products characterized by FTP descriptors (e.g., menthol, cherry) in tobacco retailers visited by VP and non-VP young adults, (2) Compare differences in harm perceptions and appeal of FTP vs non-FTP advertisements and descriptors across VP and non-VP young adults and (3) Examine the predictive utility of FTP advertising and descriptor exposure on susceptibility, intentions to use, and initiation of FTPs (and non-FTPs) at 6-month follow-up across VP and non-VP young adults. This unique approach to triangulate data at the store and individual cognitive level will yield timely information given the increase in use of FTPs and the need to identify new policies and approaches to combat tobacco disparities in vulnerable groups. Achieving the aims of this R21 will establish whether these associations exist and provide the foundation for a larger study developing interventions correcting FTP misperceptions, promoting FTP de-normalization among young adults , and examining the likely impact of local policies to restrict FTP availability and advertising particularly in vulnerable communities. This study can also provide a basis for examining targeted marketing of other harmful products at POS. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to address a potential cause of tobacco use and, ultimately, cancer disparities by examining targeted advertising of flavored tobacco products in vulnerable populations compared with a non-vulnerable population of young adults in Washington, DC. It also explores a potential solution through examination of a restriction or ban on flavored tobacco products (FTP) as a way to reduce disparities. This project links level of exposure to FTP advertising and descriptors to: perceptions of harm and attractiveness of FTPs, susceptibility to using FTPs, and initiation of FTP use and differences in these relationships across vulnerable group status.",Exposure to flavored tobacco advertising and associations with future use in young adults: implications for health equity,9314901,R21CA208206,"['Advertising ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Attitude ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Cues ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Marketing ', ' Menthol ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Persuasive Communication ', ' Persuasion ', ' Public Policy ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sales ', ' Smoking ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' African ', ' Policies ', ' Respondent ', ' Descriptor ', ' Exposure to ', ' Consensus ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' Flavoring ', ' Flavoring Agents ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' cancer risk ', ' authority ', ' Cigarette ', ' Cigar ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' hookah ', ' waterpipe ', ' water pipe ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cherry - dietary ', ' Cherries ', ' Advertisements ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Population Group ', ' ward ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' attributable death ', ' attributable mortality ', ' cost ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' combat ', ' health equity ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' e-cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NCI,TRUTH INITIATIVE FOUNDATION,R21,2017,168483,0.10821256550795359
"Web-based Smoking Cessation Program for Tribal College Students DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  American Indian tribal college students have the highest smoking rates of any racial/ethnic group in the young adult population and also are disproportionately burdened by smoking-related morbidity and mortality. There are very few effective culturally-tailored smoking cessation programs for AI smokers. Our research group has worked with the American Indian community for the past 8 years to develop a culturally-tailored smoking cessation program (All Nations Breath of Life - ANBL), for AI adult smokers. All Nations Breath of Life was developed using the community-based participatory research approach and is an in-person group based program that incorporates cultural issues throughout the program. We have produced 30% cessation rates at 6-month follow-up with adult American Indian smokers from tribes and nations in the Midwest. Due to limited studies with the tribal college population, we have already conducted a cross-sectional internet-based survey to collect information on their smoking behaviors as well as other health behaviors. This research experience and strong collaboration with the AI community leaves us well poised to adapt the ANBL program for the tribal college smoking population. However, this current program needs substantial modifications to meet the unique needs of the tribal college student population. It recognizes the sacred role of tobacco among many American Indians and how culture affects smoking cessation among AIs, while still addressing recreational smoking. However, preliminary data from our recent studies indicate that the internet may be more favorable and appropriate delivery method for reaching this younger and more mobile tribal college population due to the web interactivity, immediacy of feedback, and wide reach and accessibility. This current proposal reflects a natural progression to addressing the significant problem of smoking among tribal college students using our successful methods. In this study, we will adapt and test a culturally tailored internet-based smoking cessation (I-ANBL) program based on ANBL, which was developed through CBPR methods. For the current proposal, we will conduct an individual randomized controlled trial (N=242) to test the effectiveness of an internet-based culturally-tailored smoking cessation program (I-ANBL) in a tribal college student population. Data will be collected at baseline, 3 months and 6 months using salivary cotinine, as well as comprehensive set of environmental and psychosocial measures. We hypothesize that AI tribal college students randomized to the culturally-tailored smoking cessation internet arm (I-ANBL) will have significantly higher continuous abstinence rates at 6 months than those receiving the heart healthy diet intervention (I-FV), focusing on increasing fruit and vegetable consumption. We will also examine the costs of delivering the tailored intervention program and potential mediators and moderators of the intervention-cessation relationship. Such a high-reach, low-cost strategy for promoting smoking cessation in this at-risk and underserved population could have great potential for adoption on a larger scale and thus help reduce existing health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  American Indians (AI) have the highest rates of cigarette smoking of any major racial/ethnic group in the US, approaching 40% to 50%. Despite the overall decline in adult smoking prevalence during the past several decades, the young adult (18-29 year olds) age group has the highest prevalence of smoking. We will conduct a randomized trial to test the effectiveness of an internet-based culturally-tailored smoking cessation program among tribal college students.",Web-based Smoking Cessation Program for Tribal College Students,9247146,R01CA174481,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Alien ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Conceptions ', ' Scotine ', ' Cotinine ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Feedback ', ' Habits ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart ', ' Marketing ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Program Appropriateness ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Tribes ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' enhancing factor ', ' base ', ' Biochemical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' diet intervention ', ' Nutritional Interventions ', ' Nutrition Interventions ', ' Dietary Intervention ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Smoker ', ' Life ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' programs ', ' Salivary ', ' good diet ', ' Healthy diet ', ' psychosocial ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' university student ', ' college student ', ' high school ', ' intervention program ', ' Cigarette ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' twelfth grade ', ' high school senior ', ' 12th grade ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Reporting ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' tribal university ', ' tribal college ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,556175,0.21361444884608607
"Econometric Analysis of Cigarette Purchases on Native American Reservations PROJECT SUMMARY Cigarette taxation is a widely used tobacco control policy that can improve public health by discouraging smoking. Due to their legal status, Native American reservations (NARs) and First Nations reserves are important sources of lower- or un-taxed cigarettes in the U.S. and Canada. In some geographic areas and times, the prevalence of NAR purchases reaches over 40%. Data from the 2010-11 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Survey implies that 5.6 million smokers live in 7 states where the prevalence of NAR purchases is between 15% and 35%. The policy trend towards higher cigarette taxes means that tax avoidance through NARs is likely to grow substantially. The 2014 Surgeon General's Report, the CDC (2015), and the National Research Council Institute of Medicine (2015) stress the public health significance of, and need for additional research into, contraband cigarette markets including NARs. The project's broad goal is to study the impact of NAR cigarette availability on smoking, birth outcomes, and health disparities. Aim 1 is to conduct a quasi-experimental analysis of the impact of the availability of NAR cigarettes on adult smoking participation. We will analyze individual-level data on smoking from multiple large U.S. and Canada secondary data sets. Our econometric specification will test 4 hypotheses: 1) that state cigarette excise taxes reduce adult smoking; 2) that the impact of taxes on smoking varies depending upon the availability of NAR cigarettes; 3) that the availability of NAR cigarettes has a causal treatment effect to increase smoking; and 4) that the impacts of taxes and NAR cigarette availability on adult smoking varies with socioeconomic status. Aim 2 is to conduct a quasi-experimental analysis of the impact of the availability of NAR cigarettes on youth smoking participation, cigarettes smoked per day, and smoking initiation. We will test the 4 hypotheses listed under Aim 1 in the context of youth smoking. Aim 3 is to conduct a quasi-experimental analysis of the impact of the availability of NAR cigarettes on health outcomes and health disparities. We will test the 4 hypotheses listed under Aim 1 in the context of health outcomes. Aim 4 is to conduct a quasi-experimental analysis of the indirect effects of the availability of reservation cigarettes on the prices charged by off-reservation cigarette retailers. Our econometric analysis will test whether cigarette sales on nearby NARs is associated with lower cigarette prices and sales off-reservation. Aim 5 is to conduct a more structural econometric analysis of the impact of the availability of NAR cigarettes on individuals' joint decisions about smoking, purchase location, and cigarette price paid. We will estimate a structural endogenous switching regression model. The estimated model will directly estimate key mechanisms or links in the chain of causality: the impact of taxes and distance on the probability of NAR purchases; and the impact of NAR purchases on cigarette prices paid. X Cigarette taxation is a widely used tobacco control policy that can improve public health by discouraging smoking. Due to their special legal status, Native American reservations are an important source of un-taxed cigarettes. Beyond the significance for public health in general, this source of un-taxed cigarettes is especially significant for health disparities. This project proposes econometric studies of the impact of taxes and the availability of untaxed cigarettes on adult smoking, youth smoking, infant health, maternal smoking, and health disparities.

"RCT of An Internet Cessation Program Plus Online Social Network for HIV + Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are 1.1 million persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the US: 60% smoke cigarettes and 75% are interested in quitting. Two-thirds of PLWH use the Internet, making this a promising avenue to deliver smoking cessation treatment. Almost none are currently accessing smoking cessation interventions designed to meet their specific needs and concerns. Cigarette smoking is responsible for 24%--61% of deaths among PLWH, and 30% of non-AIDS defining malignancies. It is driving the alarming rise in lung cancers in this highly vulnerable population. The lack of access to proven, effective, culturally appropriate tobacco cessation services represents a health disparity of the first order.  Cessation websites offer smokers convenience, low (or no) cost, and anonymity; however, there are no publicly available web-based cessation programs specifically designed for PLWH smokers. Smokers living with HIV have high rates of nicotine dependence, anxiety, depression, loneliness, and substance use. We developed Positively Smoke Free on the Web (PSFW), a theory-driven, culturally tailored web-based program designed to address the specific needs of PLWH smokers. Our NCI-funded R21 pilot of PSFW demonstrated moderate-high levels of adherence and yielded higher 3-month abstinence rates compared to standard care (10% vs. 4%). Our prior research on web-based cessation interventions has shown that smokers who participate in an online community - whether passively reading posts by others or actively engaging in online discussions - are more than twice as likely to achieve abstinence even after controlling for a broad range of covariates. In preparation for the proposed study, our partners at the American Legacy Foundation have enhanced and modernized PSFW by integrating an online community platform (now ""PSFW+""), developing a training protocol for PLWH smoker seed users (to provide a critical mass of social network participants), and recruiting and training 11 PLWH smokers for this role. The prototype PSFW+ application has been successfully alpha- and beta-tested in anticipation of the randomized controlled trial.  We propose a study that will compare the efficacy of the PSFW+ smoking cessation website to an attention- matched website promoting cardiovascular health in a randomized controlled trial with repeated measures at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months. Participants will be N=550 PLWH smokers interested in quitting in the next 30 days. All participants will be offered nicotine replacement therapy. It is hypothesized that PSFW+ will outperform the control condition on the primary outcome of 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 months post-randomization. Secondary aims and exploratory analyses will examine theory-driven hypotheses about the mediators and moderators of treatment outcome (e.g., depression, anxiety, social support, loneliness, self-efficacy). Establishing the effectiveness of a web-based smoking cessation program for PLWH that has broad reach and could be scaled to reach PLWH smokers throughout the US would not only represent an enormous advance in the fight against tobacco use in PLWH, but would also provide a clearer understanding of the role of targeted, web-based health interventions in comprehensive HIV care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Smoking rates among persons living with HIV (PLWH) are triple those in the general adult population in the US, and there are few, if any, cessation resources available that address their particular needs. This study will examine the efficacy of a web-based smoking cessation program and online social network specifically developed for PLWH. As one of the first studies of its kind, the proposed research will yield important insights into an intervention approach that could be scaled nationally to reach PLWH smokers throughout the US.",RCT

"Intergenerational transmission of smoking in low SES and minority populations ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite vast public information about smoking's negative health consequences, and the proliferation of rules limiting access to cigarettes, smoking continues to be the leading preventable cause of death and disease in the United States. Moreover, after vast declines in smoking rates following the release of the Surgeon General's seminal report, regular smoking rates have leveled at about 18% among US adults, but reaching 41% among those with General Education Diplomas. There are also race/ethnic disparities in smoking and smoking related disease. While smoking rates are highest among Caucasian and Hispanic adolescents, rates among Blacks equal Caucasians and surpass Hispanics in adults. Further, the incidence of cancers of the lungs and bronchus is 23% higher for Black than White males. Moreover, density of tobacco outlets is highest in areas in which the poor and minorities live, placing the low SES and minorities at additional risk. Yet, despite knowledge of the disproportional risks to these populations, we know little about what factors predispose low socioeconomic status (SES) and minority populations to smoke, and why and how smoking rates among minorities change with age. The proposed study will take full advantage of an existing large and extensive nationally representative longitudinal dataset, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and its supplements to fill these research gaps. This PSID and its child development supplement and Transition to Adulthood extensions provide unparalleled rich data to identify the factors affecting behavior across generations, and critical o our purpose, oversample low income and Black participants. As such, using this tremendous data source will allow us to comprehensively assess smoking trajectories and the contextual and person factors influencing the initiation of smoking and progression to regular smoking in low SES and minority youth and young adults. Further, and critical for public health policy, with access to PSID neighborhood data, we will identify and map the density of tobacco outlets to establish an index of exposure to smoking influences, providing the most conclusive answer to date on the relative influence of contextual and person factors on smoking behavior. As such, our aims are to identify the various smoking trajectories among low SES and minority adolescents and young adults, and the specific contextual, behavioral, and person factors characterizing the different trajectories of smoking. The results of the proposed study will provide critical data to inform a future smoking prevention study tailored to reduce health disparities related to smoking. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disease in the United States, with its negative health consequences, however, felt most strongly among lower socioeconomic status (SES) individuals and minorities. Unfortunately, little is known about how smoking develops and progresses in these populations, and what personal, family, and community factors influence its developmental course from adolescence into young adulthood. We aim to fill this significant research gap using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a large ongoing nationally representative dataset spanning 45 years and multiple generations, and use the results of the proposed study to provide the necessary data to inform an innovative smoking prevention trial tailored to low SES and minority adolescents and young adults.",Intergenerational transmission of

"Ovarian Hormones Effect on Smoking Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco smoking is a leading cause of preventable death and disability in the U.S. Although women compared to men are at a greater risk of smoking-related disease morbidity and mortality, research suggests they may smoke for different reasons than men and have a harder time quitting than men. Research identifying female-specific factors underlying addiction is critical for: (a) addressing sex-related health disparities; (b) informing female-specific treatments; and (c) discovering addiction processes that are overrepresented among females yet applicable to both sexes. Ovarian hormones represent a female specific factor implicate in the maintenance of nicotine addiction and success following a quit attempt. This proposal aims to advance this line of research by combining ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with daily hormonal sampling across an entire menstrual cycle to further examine the patterns and mechanisms of ovarian hormone variation effects on smoking in women in real time. The use of prospective daily recordings and hormonal sampling will allow us to test whether smoking will be higher on days with high estrogen and lower on days with high progesterone (Aim 1), that women with greater estrogen to progesterone ratios compared to women with lower estrogen to progesterone ratios across the entire menstrual cycle will smoke more and be more nicotine dependent (Aim 2), and that days with higher estrogen will be marked by greater nicotine reward and worse cognitive control, which will mediate relations between higher estrogen and increased smoking (Aim 3). Secondary aims will explore variability of hormonal effects across the menstrual cycle (Aim 4). As the first comprehensive study investigating daily changes in ovarian hormones, drug reward, cognitive control, and smoking behavior, this project will pave the way for a program of research involving more intensive laboratory and field-based studies of psychoneuroendocrinological underpinnings of smoking in women.  Through expert mentoring, directed readings, formal coursework and seminars, onsite training, attending national scientific meetings, manuscript and grant preparation, mentorship of students in the USC Health, Emotion, and Addiction Laboratory, and the completion of the proposed investigation expertise will be gained in: (a) Naturalistic field assessment of nicotine addiction; (b) EMA design and implementation; and (c) Use of advanced statistical methodology to test the aims outlined by the project. Thus, by the end of the proposed training period, the applicant will be uniquely positioned to run an independent interdisciplinary line of research incorporating both lab and field based studies in investigating female specific factors in addiction. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clarifying the role of ovarian hormones on smoking may aid cessation treatment in women and could provide further evidence for the use of hormone-based medications for smoking cessation in both sexes.

"Promoting Smoking Cessation among Individuals with Food Insecurity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite overall declines in the prevalence of cigarette smoking, smoking remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death. Smoking prevalence is also disproportionately concentrated among population groups that are economically disadvantaged, contributing to an uneven burden of tobacco-related health problems. Socioeconomic disparities in tobacco use persist largely because economically disadvantaged smokers are less likely to succeed in quitting than non-economically disadvantaged smokers. Many economically disadvantaged smokers are motivated to quit, but various life stressors pose significant barriers to cessation. One of the most stressful conditions in the experience of poverty is food insecurity, or the inability to afford adequate and appropriate foods needed to live an active and healthy life. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that food insecurity is independently associated with increased odds of smoking. However, proximal factors linking food insecurity and smoking are not well understood, and research has not extended this association towards informing cessation. Extant literature suggests that there are shared psychological (e.g., stress) and physiological (e.g., hunger) factors that may predispose food insecure smokers to encountering difficulties with quitting smoking. The overall goal of this proposal is to build the candidate's research expertise on the intersection of food insecurity, smoking, and quitting. This award will support the candidate's career development as a social and health psychologist whose research addresses social determinants of health to promote smoking cessation among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. The career development plan includes advanced training and mentorship in (1) social epidemiology, (2) qualitative research methods, (3) food insecurity and nutrition policy, and (4) smoking cessation intervention research. Aim 1 of the proposed study will determine whether the experience of food insecurity is associated with continued smoking among a nationally representative sample of low-income smokers, using extant longitudinal data from the 2001-2013 Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Aim 2 will target a subset of the local population with food insecurity—individuals seeking federal food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in San Francisco, California—to conduct surveys and in-depth interviews on the lived experience of food insecurity and its association with smoking behaviors and quitting. Aim 3 will develop and pilot test a smoking cessation outreach program that is delivered to 100 smokers with food insecurity in the context of SNAP, which provides a novel venue for smoking cessation and health promotion research. Taken together, this research and training plan will lay the foundation for a planned community-based randomized controlled trial of a smoking cessation intervention targeting households with food insecurity. This work has the potential to inform reductions in tobacco-related health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will identify how a key aspect of socioeconomic stress—the experience of food insecurity—is associated with smoking behaviors and smoking cessation among smokers who are economically disadvantaged. This study will also develop a smoking cessation promotion outreach program that is delivered in the context of a federal nutrition assistance program. Taken together, this research has the clear potential to address disproportionately high rates of smoking in economically disadvantaged populations by leveraging existing social service infrastructures for smoking cessation and health promotion.",Promoting Smoking Cessation among Individuals with Food Insecurity,9386375,K01DA043659,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Household ', ' Hunger ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' nutrition ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychologist ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' San Francisco ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Work ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' base ', ' career ', ' community planning ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Development Plans ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Nutrition Policy ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' Smoker ', ' Non-smoker ', ' nonsmoker ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' outreach ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' psychological distress ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Population Group ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Smoking and Health ', ' Smoking and Health Research ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' pilot trial ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' safety net ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' evidence base ', ' social health determinants ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Secure ', ' food environment ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' panel study of income dynamics ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,K01,2017,163638,0.1549178453754755
"A Facebook intervention for young sexual and gender minority smokers ABSTRACT  Sexual and gender minority (SGM) young adults (those who identify with a sexual orientation that is non- heterosexual such as gay, lesbian, or bisexual; or those who have a gender identity different from the sex assigned to them at birth) are disproportionately affected by tobacco use and associated health conditions; yet they face significant barriers to treatment participation and lower levels of satisfaction with treatment than others. Despite consensus that SGMs fare better when programs are tailored to address their specific needs, there is an extreme lack of such services available. Social media offer phenomenal opportunity to engage young people in intervention to treat tobacco use. Our group has developed the Facebook Tobacco Status Project (TSP), a stage-matched smoking cessation intervention for young adults based on US Clinical Practice Guidelines for smoking cessation, with evidence of short-term efficacy with young adult smokers. A culturally- tailored intervention may improve quit rates with SGM young adults. With pilot funds from UC San Francisco, our team has conducted mixed-methods formative work with SGM young adult smokers to inform the development of the Put It Out Project (POP) - an adaptation of TSP for SGM young adults. This project will bring together an interdisciplinary team with experience in the areas of SGM tobacco use, social media intervention, social media analytics, and clinical trials testing interventions for tobacco use, to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of POP. We will evaluate POP against the original TSP intervention in a randomized design with 120 SGM young adults throughout the United States who have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes and smoke cigarettes on 4 or more days per week. Participants will be recruited online and randomized to either POP with tailored content or the original TSP intervention. Both conditions will assign SGM participants to a private Facebook group and deliver a 90-day intervention including Facebook postings and weekly “The Dr. Is In” sessions with a trained counselor to guide group sessions. Two historical control conditions from our current clinical trial include assignment to TSP with non-SGM participants and referral to the NCI smokefree.gov program. All participants will complete baseline, 3-, and 6-month follow-up assessments online. Primary outcome will be biochemically-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence from tobacco. Within the TSP-SGM and TSP conditions, analyses will examine features of Facebook posts and user communications that are most strongly related to tobacco outcomes. This is the first project involving the target community to use Facebook to treat tobacco dependence among SGM young adults. Results will be used to design a clinical trial powered to detect significant effects across groups, thereby determining optimal intervention for a priority population. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will test a novel social media intervention targeting tobacco use among sexual and gender minority young adults. A tailored intervention that is delivered through the highly accessible and widely used medium of Facebook is expected to be engaging to a marginalized population, thereby reducing a key health inequity.

"Evaluating how licensing-law strategies will change neighborhood disparities in tobacco retailer density PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Adding or modifying tobacco licensing laws is becoming an increasingly popular tobacco control approach, but the implications for health disparities is unknown. Currently, it is well-documented that the density of tobacco retailers is greater in low-income, African American, and Hispanic neighborhoods. Marketing at these retailers' points of sale impacts the social environment and can have powerful effects on promoting initiation and inhibiting cessation. With licensing-law strategies, communities can not only require stores to obtain a license to sell tobacco, but can set stipulations to granting these licenses (e.g., capping the number of retailers in an area, or banning retailers from within 1000 feet of a school). Research suggests this public policy approach is an effective means for reducing the number of tobacco retailers and their corresponding point-of-sale marketing. However, some of these strategies could be more beneficial for affluent, low-minority areas than for low-income, high-racial/ethnic minority areas—what the proposal is referring to as “high risk” areas. This potential outcome is particularly troubling given that low-income, African American, and Hispanic populations also exhibit some of the highest rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the purpose of this R21 proposal is to evaluate in Ohio the equality-impact of the four major licensing-law strategies that have been proposed to restrict tobacco retailers. Aim 1 will test whether reducing the number and/or density of tobacco retailers will reduce inequalities in the distribution of tobacco retailers. Aim 2 will test whether restricting tobacco retailers from being close to schools will reduce current inequalities in the distribution of tobacco retailers. Aim 3 will test whether banning tobacco sales in pharmacies will exacerbate inequalities in the distribution of tobacco retailers. Analyses will be conducted using spatial modeling techniques, which have rarely been used in tobacco control research. With a list that has already been acquired of all 10,722 tobacco retailers in Ohio, analyses will begin by establishing the current, pre-policy state of tobacco retailer density, at the census-tract level. Each aim will then model the effects of a licensing-law restriction and estimate the post- policy retailer density. Finally, each policy will be evaluated in terms of its equality-impact (whether it will provide less, equal, or greater benefit to vulnerable groups). Three benchmarks will be used: the % reduction in retailer density is not greater for low-risk census tracts; the strength of the relation between tobacco retailer density and sociodemographics has diminished; and the post-policy density of tobacco retailers is not greater in low-risk census tracts. This novel project will provide much-need information on the relative equality-impact of the major licensing-law strategies. Findings will guide state and community efforts away from licensing-law strategies that will inadvertently widen the nation's cancer disparities and toward licensing-law strategies that will have a positive equality-impact. As the first project to integrate licensing-law research with disparities research, this project could significantly change the direction of tobacco control research and policy. PROJECT NARRATIVE: RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH An increasingly popular tobacco control approach is licensing-law strategies, whereby communities set stipulations to granting tobacco-retail licenses (e.g., capping the number of retailers in an area, or banning retailers from within 1000 feet of a school). Our research is relevant to public health because it will provide the first information on which licensing-law strategies are effective for low-income, high-racial/ethnic minority areas, compared to affluent, low-minority areas. The project is relevant to NCI's mission because it will help guide tobacco control efforts toward licensing-law strategies that will reduce income- and race/ethnicity-based cancer disparities.",Evaluating how licensing-law strategies will change neighborhood disparities in tobacco retailer density,9225350,R21CA212308,"['Advertising ', ' Boston ', ' Budgets ', ' California ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' foot ', ' Gases ', ' Grant ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interest Group ', ' Laws ', ' Marketing ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Ohio ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sales ', ' Schools ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' sound ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Specialist ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' density ', ' rural area ', ' Area ', ' Licensing ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Modeling ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Street Address ', ' ST-ADDR ', ' Legal ', ' Low income ', ' Tobacco Control Research ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' tobacco control ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' ']",NCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,161508,0.12679982670830442
"Telephone-Delivered Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Smoking Cessation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Smoking cessation telephone quit lines (QLs), available in all 50 states; now serve over 500,000 smokers each year. On average, only 14% (range: 8% to 20%) of QL callers stop smoking by the 12 month follow-up even with the aid of traditional Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) combined with pharmacotherapy (typically nicotine replacement therapy; NRT). The low quit rates of QLs stifle their great potential public health impact. To address the low quit rate problem, and thereby start a new research paradigm focused on innovative QL behavioral intervention content, we propose to test a novel counseling approach, called Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), as a telephone-delivered quit smoking intervention. We recently completed a small (N = 121) NIDA R21 pilot randomized QL trial of proactively-delivered ACT vs. CBT in state QL callers that was underpowered due to R21 budget limits. Results showed that ACT: (1) was feasible to implement and evaluate in a state QL context, (2) had higher participant engagement and satisfaction than CBT, (3) had higher levels of acceptance of cravings than CBT, which in turn predicted quitting smoking, and (4) had higher (albeit non-significant) 6-month post randomization quit rates than CBT. Building on these promising and non- definitive results, a comparative effectiveness randomized trial with a large and fully-powered sample size (N = 1168) and longer term follow-up (i.e., 12 months) is now needed to definitively determine whether telephone- delivered ACT: (1) provides higher quit rates than CBT, (2) operates according to its theory-based mechanisms, and (3) is more cost-effective than CBT. Accordingly, we propose to conduct a randomized comparative effectiveness trial of telephone-delivered ACT counseling plus NRT (n=584) versus telephone-delivered traditional CBT counseling plus NRT (n=584) in state quit line callers, in order to demonstrate that telephone-delivered ACT: (1) has significantly higher 30-day point prevalence abstinence at 12 months post-randomization than telephone-delivered traditional CBT; (2) has smoking cessation outcomes significantly mediated by three psychological processes central to the theoretical model underlying ACT: acceptance of internal (a) sensations, (b) emotions, and (c) thoughts that cue smoking; (3) Will be significantly more cost-effective than telephone-delivered CBT, as measured by cost per additional quitter, incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER), and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The study, well-motivated by preliminary results, shows exciting promise for improving the success rates of quit lines and thereby lowering healthcare costs and reducing premature tobacco-related deaths. If shown to be efficacious and cost-effective, ACT would provide the scientific field a new conceptual model of QL intervention and quit lines a new treatment approach that could help 45,000 more (of the 500,000) quit line callers to stop smoking each year, thereby saving in medical costs and prolonging lives.

"A Family-Focused Intervention for Asian American Male Smokers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Family-Focused Intervention for Asian American Male Smokers Smoking prevalence remains high in subgroups of Asian American men, particularly among those with low English proficiency (LEP) and immigrants from cultures where smoking prevalence is high, including Chinese and Vietnamese. The 2011-12 California Health Interview Survey estimates that nearly half (46%) of all Asian male smokers in California are either Chinese or Vietnamese. The smoking prevalence's among LEP Chinese and Vietnamese men were 32% and 43%, respectively, compared to 16% of the general California male population. We developed a family-focused intervention utilizing lay health worker (LWH) outreach that integrates formative qualitative research and selected constructs from Social Network Theory, Social Cognitive Theory, and the Trans-theoretical Model. The intervention involves 2 small group education sessions with dyads of smokers and family members, and 2 follow-up individual telephone calls delivered by LHWs over 2 months. Our single-group pilot trial with 96 dyads of Chinese and Vietnamese male daily smokers and their family members showed a high feasibility of recruiting unmotivated smokers (42% were at ""precontemplation""), and a promising 7-day point prevalence abstinence rate of 30% at 3 months with independent corroboration from family members. The first aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the family-focused intervention in promoting smoking cessation in Chinese and Vietnamese male smokers. The second aim is to explore mediators to identify key psychosocial and behavioral processes that underlie how the intervention affects the processes of quitting and maintaining abstinence. We will conduct a 2-arm cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with assessments at baseline, 6 and 12 months following intervention initiation. The RCT involves 60 lay health workers (LHWs); each recruits and delivers interventions to 6 dyads of one male daily smoker and one family member from his household, for a total 360 smoker-family dyads. Half of the LHWs, stratified by Asian subgroup and smoking history, will be randomized to the family-focused intervention group and the other half will be assigned to an attention control condition receiving education on healthy eating. All participants will receive written information on smoking cessation resources. We hypothesize that, at 6 and 12 month follow-up, the intervention smokers will be more likely to achieve biochemically verified smoking abstinence (7-day point prevalence), to report having made at least one 24-hour quit attempt, and to report using at least one evidence-based smoking cessation resource (quitline, medication, health professional advice) than smokers in the control condition. Using prospective quantitative data obtained from the RCT, and post-trial dyadic and individual interviews of 30 smokers and 30 family members selected based on abstinence experiences, we will explore mediators at individual, family and social network levels that explain how the intervention affects quitting and maintaining abstinence. The long-term goal is to understand effective ways to utilize family-based and social outreach strategies to reduce tobacco use disparities in hard-to-reach populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will examine the use of an innovative strategy that involves lay health worker outreach to mobilize smokers and their families to promote smoking cessation in Chinese and Vietnamese American men. This project will yield a significant public health impact as it addresses gaps in knowledge about effective strategies for treating tobacco dependence in underrepresented populations where smoking prevalence is disproportionately high such as among Chinese and Vietnamese American men.",A Family-Focused Intervention for Asian American Male Smokers,9276635,R01DA036749,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Asian Americans ', ' California ', ' Chinese American ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Household and Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Household ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Family member ', ' Social Network ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' Biochemical ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Immigrant ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Smoking History ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' post intervention ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' pilot trial ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' Network-based ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' FDA approved ', ' group intervention ', ' population based ', ' arm ', ' attentional control ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' ']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2017,638304,0.20319047704545187
"Assessing Smoking Dependence Among Spanish-speaking Latino Smokers Project Summary/Abstract  While prominent theories of addiction implicate physical dependence as a key predictor of drug use and relapse, the limited available research among Latinos has generally found that physical dependence has limited utility for predicting cessation. Further, Spanish-language instruments for measuring dependence multidimensionally have demonstrated poor psychometric structure among Spanish-speaking Latino smokers. These studies suggest that the mere translation of existing measures may not be adequate for developing effective assessments of tobacco dependence for Spanish-speaking smokers. Rather, there is critical need for an in-depth examination of the appropriateness of dependence scale translations and the relevance of item content for Spanish-speaking Latino smokers. As such, the aim of the current study is to use a mixed-methods approach to develop a theoretically grounded, multidimensional measure of smoking dependence and motives for smoking based on established measures but that is appropriate, reliable, and valid for Spanish-speaking smokers. We propose a four-phase study. Phase 1 will consist of cognitive testing of Spanish translations of the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM) and Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale (NDSS) items to identify potential problems with the items as currently translated. Phase 2 will consist of in-depth interviews of the lived experience of dependence among Spanish-speaking smokers of Mexican origin to inform item refinement and development of additional items. Phase 3 will consist of item refinement and development informed by data gathered in Phases 1 and 2. Phase 4 will consist of validation of the resulting refined Brief WISDM and NDSS scales, as well as an examination of the entire pool of resulting items for potential development of a different and possibly more appropriate measure. Such a project stands to significantly impact research among Latinos across the tobacco continuum by allowing for more valid assessments of dependence among Latinos, which could lead to novel culturally relevant knowledge of the processes involved in smoking initiation, maintenance, cessation and relapse. Project Narrative/Public Health Impact The smoking pattern of Latino smokers differs notably from that of non-Latino White smokers in a manner that suggests physical dependence may not be a strong motivator of tobacco use and smoking relapse among Latino smokers. Multidimensional measures of dependence may be more useful, but research on dependence among Spanish-speaking smokers is hampered by a lack of psychometrically sound Spanish-language measures of dependence. Development of valid, multidimensional assessments of dependence among Spanish-speaking Mexican-origin smokers, who represent the largest proportion of Latino smokers, would allow for the conduct of research that could lead to novel, culturally relevant knowledge of the processes involved in smoking initiation, maintenance, cessation and relapse. It stands to improve interventions tailored to or targeted at Latino smokers by informing more culturally appropriate assessment of nicotine dependence. Advancing knowledge in these areas would help to identify treatment targets, improve current smoking cessation interventions, and ultimately aid in eliminating tobacco-related health disparities among Latinos.",Assessing Smoking Dependence Among Spanish-speaking Latino Smokers,9388081,R21MD011431,"['Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Nicotine ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' sound ', ' Syndrome ', ' Tobacco ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Mexican ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Physical Dependence ', ' Smoker ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' experience ', ' Proxy ', ' Cigarette ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cessation Research ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' drug relapse ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' smoking relapse ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Drug Modelings ', ' Interview ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2017,241550,0.14549790157878856
"e-Decidete: Mobile Cessation Support for Latino Smokers Project Summary - eDecídete: Mobile Cessation Support for Latino Smokers  Latinos are less likely than non-Hispanic whites to have access to health, to have knowledge of existing smoking cessation resources, to receive advice to stop smoking, and to participate in smoking cessation programs. Mobile technologies can dramatically enhance the reach of effective smoking cessation interventions. However, the reach of mobile interventions among Latinos remains minimal despite the fact that Latinos utilize smartphones at a higher rate. The primary aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of eDecídete (Spanish for “you can choose”), an innovative 12 week mobile smoking cessation intervention based on this work that incorporates two elements: 1) a tablet-based e-health educational session that collects personal smoking-related information to develop an individualized quit plan and guide automated and interactive text messaging; and 2) a text messaging program that includes educational information, behavioral strategies, motivational and supportive messaging, and prompts to use pharmacotherapy to support smoking cessation. Aim 1. To evaluate the impact of the culturally accommodated eDecídete program versus standard care on smoking abstinence at Month 6 among Latino smokers. At Month 6, smokers in eDecídete will have significantly higher cotinine-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence (no cigarettes in the past 7 days) than smokers in the control arm. Aim 2. To assess therapeutic alliance, pharmacotherapy utilization, and self-efficacy as mediators of the presumed treatment effect on cotinine-verified 7-day smoking abstinence at Month 6 among Latino smokers. Our hypothesis is that eDecídete will have greater efficacy for smoking cessation than standard care by increasing therapeutic alliance, utilization of pharmacotherapy, and self-efficacy to quit. Aim 3. To conduct a process evaluation that can inform findings and future improvements. The evaluation will assess 1) satisfaction with the program and its components; 2) text-message system utilization patterns and common content themes in text message interactions among eDecídete participants. Project Narrative Latinos are the largest and fastest growing population in the U.S., and tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease and death among U.S. Latinos. Although enhancing tobacco use treatment for this at-risk, underserved group is a critical public health priority, little is known about effectively treating Latino smokers. This innovative study will directly evaluate a culturally-enhanced technology-driven, smoking cessation intervention for Latino smokers, with the long-term goal of reducing tobacco-related health disparities, disease and death among Latinos.",e-Decidete: Mobile Cessation Support for Latino Smokers,9218746,R01CA212189,"['Adoption ', ' Communities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Scotine ', ' Cotinine ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Smoking ', ' Tablets ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Services ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Enhancement Technology ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' community based service ', ' Abstinence ', ' treatment effect ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' community setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' successful intervention ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' public health priorities ', ' follow up assessment ', ' arm ', ' eHealth ', ' e-Health ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,644889,0.19552421322662938
"Minority Stress and Cigarette Smoking among Sexual Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Health disparities in tobacco and other substance use are well documented between sexual minorities (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer) and heterosexual individuals across the lifespan. In particular, sexual minority youth (SMY) initiate tobacco use at younger ages and smoke cigarettes at higher rates than their heterosexual counterparts. Stigma and discrimination-related stressors specific to their minority sexual orientation (i.e., minority stressors) contribute to our understanding of health disparities among SMY. Minority stressors are often experienced daily by SMY. As such, SMY may smoke cigarettes as a way to cope with negative affect elicited by these stigma-based stressors. In fact, cross-sectional research shows that minority stressors are correlated with cigarette smoking and other substance use among SMY. Important limitations of the extant literature, however, include overreliance on cross-sectional and retrospective self-report data, failure to account for within- and between-individual differences in minority stressors and smoking behaviors, and lack of discernment of unique contributions of minority stressors on smoking beyond individual differences in daily general stressors, lifetime cumulative stress, and mental health. In addition, we know very little about the mediating mechanisms between minority stressors and cigarette smoking. Consistent with Institute of Medicine and the NIH Sexual and Gender Minority Research Coordinating Committee's call to expand our understanding of factors contributing to SMY’s higher levels of tobacco and other substance use, and in response to NIH PA-15-263’s focus on sexual minority health research, we propose an innovative exploratory study (R21). We propose a rigorous examination of the effects of minority stressors on cigarette smoking in real time in the natural environment among SMY using electronic experience sampling methods, specifically ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Our primary aims are to examine: a) the relationship between minority stressors and proximal changes in smoking in real time in the natural environment among 60 SMY who are regular smokers using EMA over a 30-day period; b) the effects of minority stressors on proximal changes in affect and craving; and, c) the mediating effects of affect and craving on the relationship between minority stressors and cigarette smoking. Our secondary aims of this study are to examine the effects of minority stressors on proximal changes in other substance use as well as to test resilience resources and contextual risk factors that might be associated with smoking. Findings from this exploratory study would have important theoretical implications for minority stress theory and inform the development of culturally sensitive smoking prevention and cessation interventions for SMY, targeting specific within-individual mechanisms as well as contextual factors. The proposed R21 will also provide pilot data for large scale research to more rigorously test the fine-grained psychosocial resilience and risk mechanisms associated with SMY’s smoking. PROJECT NARRATIVE: PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT  Sexual minority youth (SMY; i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer) are at increased risk for cigarette smoking and other substance use than their heterosexual peers. Cigarette smoking is a major public health concern, especially among adolescents, given the economic, societal, mortality, and morbidity burdens. The project will address how SMY’s experiences with stigma-related stressors related to their sexual orientation (i.e., minority stressors) are associated with cigarette smoking in order to inform and develop smoking interventions and improve the well-being of SMY.",Minority Stress and Cigarette Smoking among Sexual Minority Youth,9316310,R21MD010761,"['Accounting ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Attention ', ' Buffers ', ' Grain ', ' Cereals ', ' Communities ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' permissiveness ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Translations ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Failure ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Smoker ', ' Cigarette Smoker ', ' bullying ', ' bully ', ' psychosocial ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Cigarette ', ' peer ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Smoking Prevention ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' minority health ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' smoking intervention ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' sexual minority ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' queer ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' prospective test ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' ']",NIMHD,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,254999,0.07438908135913051
"A trial of Positively Smoke Free group therapy for HIV-infected smokers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are 1.1 million persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the US, 60% of them smoke cigarettes, and 75% of these are interested in quitting. Almost none are currently accessing smoking cessation interventions designed to meet their specific needs and concerns.  Cigarette smoking is responsible for 24% of deaths among PLWH, and 30% of non-AIDS defining malignancies. It is driving the alarming rise in cardiac events and lung cancers in this highly vulnerable population. The lack of access to proven, effective, culturally appropriate tobacco cessation services represents a health disparity of the first order. The psychosocial profile of the PLWH-smoker community, characterized by high rates of psychiatric comorbidity, drug and alcohol use, and low levels of social support, suggests that achieving high cessation rates will be a great challenge.  Positively Smoke Free (PSF) is an intensive, multisession, group cessation program specifically developed for PLWH smokers. A pilot study of PSF yielded promising results. This proposal aims (1) to perform a definitive efficacy study of PSF by comparing 6-month biochemically confirmed abstinence rates in subjects randomized to PSF vs. standard care in a cohort of 450 PLWH smokers, (2) to determine the sociobehavioral moderators and mediators associated with successful cessation, and (3) to complete a careful cost analysis of PSF in order to estimate the incremental cost per quit associated program participation.  If PSF is proven to be effective it will establish a new treatment option for PLWH smokers. Determination of moderators and mediators of program success will provide insight into the mode of action of the intervention and will help guide the development of additional treatment strategies in the future. Finally, the cost analyses will provide critical information abut the feasibility of program dissemination and implementation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epidemic of cigarette smoking is fueling an alarming rise in lung and other cancers in persons living with HIV (PLWH). Smokers living with HIV have few, if any, cessation resources available to them that address their particular needs, and HIV care providers have virtually no evidence base to guide their approach to tobacco treatment. The proposal, if funded, will conduct a definitive study of a group therapy intervention for PLWH smokers that showed promise in a pilot trial.",A trial of Positively Smoke Free group therapy for

"Small Financial Incentives to Promote Smoking Cessation in Safety Net Hospital Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. Although the prevalence of smoking has declined to 18.1 percent among U.S. adults, 27.9 percent of those living in poverty report current smoking. Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking cessation. There is mounting evidence that offering incentives for abstinence (i.e., Contingency Management [CM]) may be an effective approach for promoting short-term smoking cessation, though few studies have demonstrated longer-term effectiveness. In addition, little attention has been paid to socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers specifically (e.g., safety- net hospital populations) in CM intervention studies. Our preliminary work indicates that offering small escalating financial incentives for smoking abstinence dramatically increases short-term cessation rates among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers when incentives are included as an adjunct to standard clinic- based smoking cessation treatment. However, additional work is needed to evaluate the influence of this CM approach in the longer-term with a rigorous and adequately powered trial. Thus, the aims of the proposed study are to: 1) evaluate the longer-term impact of an adjunctive, low-cost CM intervention (relative to usual care) on smoking abstinence rates among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals participating in a safety-net hospital smoking cessation program, and 2) identify treatment mechanisms and contextual factors associated with cessation outcomes among intervention participants using both traditional and ecological momentary assessment approaches. Participants seeking smoking cessation treatment at an urban safety net hospital (N = 320) will be randomly assigned to 1) usual care (UC; n = 160) or 2) UC plus financial incentives for biochemically-confirmed abstinence (CM; n = 160). Those randomized to the CM intervention will have the opportunity to earn small gift cards for biochemically-verified abstinence through 12 weeks post-quit. Specifically, participants may earn $20 for abstinence on the quit date, and this amount will increase by $5 with each successive abstinent visit through 4 weeks post-quit ($150 total). Participants may additionally earn $50 gift cards for abstinence at 8 and 12 weeks post-quit. Biochemically-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks post-quit (longer-term abstinence) will be the primary outcome variable, though smoking status will be assessed at all visits. We also hope to gain a better understanding of CM treatment mechanisms and to identify other factors that directly influence cessation via traditional questionnaire and smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment approaches. Smartphone technology allows for ""real-time"" data collection to more accurately capture important cessation-related variables, and will be used to deliver gain-framed messages to support and strengthen the CM intervention. Findings will provide insight about new treatment targets for intervention research, and will demonstrate an effective, inexpensive, and easily implementable means by which to improve longer-term smoking cessation rates among economically disadvantaged smokers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking cessation. Offering incentives for abstinence is an effective approach for promoting short-term smoking cessation, though the longer-term effectiveness of this approach has not been established and little attention has been paid to socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers. The proposed study will evaluate the longer-term impact of offering adjunctive, low- cost financial incentives on smoking cessation among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals participating in a safety-net hospital smoking cessation program, and identify treatment mechanisms and contextual factors associated with cessation using both traditional and ecological momentary assessment approaches.",Small Financial Incentives to Promote Smoking Cessation in Safety Net Hospital Patients,9317447,R01CA197314,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Attention ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Larynx ', ' Malignant Laryngeal Tumor ', ' Malignant Laryngeal Neoplasm ', ' Larynx Cancer ', ' Laryngeal Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of larynx ', ' Financial cost ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' oral cavity cancer ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' psychosocial ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Visit ', ' Malignant neoplasm of esophagus ', ' oesophageal cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Esophagus ', ' Malignant Esophageal Tumor ', ' Malignant Esophageal Neoplasm ', ' Esophagus Cancer ', ' Esophageal Cancer ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' stressor ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' contingency management ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Gifts ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Renal carcinoma ', ' Renal Cancer ', ' Kidney Carcinoma ', ' Kidney Cancer ', ' Adherence ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Smoking Status ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' safety net ', ' Abstinence ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' treatment adherence ', ' clinical practice ', ' financial incentive ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,R01,2017,303797,0.28968693142061597
"Using Mobile Technology to Understand and Encourage Mindfulness for Smoking Cessa DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Although most smokers indicate interest in quitting, only 6% quit each year. Mindfulness-based interventions show promise for improving smoking cessation; however, underlying mechanisms are unclear. Furthermore, there is a dearth of research on mindfulness and smoking cessation in underserved populations (i.e., members of racial/ethnic minority groups and individuals with low socioeconomic status [SES]), who often have greater difficulty quitting smoking and experience profound tobacco-related health disparities. Mobile health technology (""mHealth"") is revolutionizing healthcare and might be used to elucidate mechanisms underlying mindfulness and enhance mindfulness-based interventions for smoking cessation.  Claire Adams, Ph.D., an Assistant Professor of Psychology at the Catholic University of America (CUA), is seeking five years of support through the K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award for training and research related to mindfulness, mHealth, advanced statistics, and health disparities research. Dr. Adams' overarching career goals are to inform, develop, evaluate, and disseminate mindfulness- based interventions to promote smoking cessation, prevent cancer and other chronic diseases, and enhance well-being in diverse populations. Through the proposed training plan, Dr. Adams will expand her knowledge and skills with regard to mindfulness, smoking cessation, and health disparities research. In order to fill important gaps in her experience thus far, she will gain specialized training related to mHealth and the advanced statistics necessary for analyzing multi-level and longitudinal data. Dr. Adams will work with her mentoring team (led by Dr. David Wetter and comprising experts in fields of psychology, engineering, public health, and biostatistics) to complete formal coursework, specialized workshops, and directed readings.  Primary research aims are to: 1) utilize advanced statistics and mHealth technology to determine mechanisms through which mindfulness influences smoking cessation, and 2) design and test the feasibility of a mHealth-enhanced mindfulness-based intervention for smoking cessation. Toward the first aim, Dr. Adams will learn and apply advanced multilevel modeling techniques to determine mechanisms underlying mindfulness and smoking cessation in three existing datasets that include diverse samples of smokers. Toward the second aim, Dr. Adams will work with her mentoring team to develop and test the feasibility of a mindfulness-based smoking cessation treatment that is supplemented by between-session text messaging. This program aims to deliver personalized intervention to participants in their natural environments and in the moments when they might benefit most. Findings from this feasibility study will inform and provide pilot data for an R01 application of a larger randomized controlled trial. Dr. Adams will conduct the proposed work at CUA, which will provide space, time, equipment, and other resources for research and training.  The proposed research will be the first known to use mobile technology to examine mechanisms underlying mindfulness and smoking, as well as the first known study to use text messaging to enhance mindfulness- based smoking cessation. Furthermore, all proposed studies will target racially/ethnically diverse and low-SES populations (who are at disproportionate risk for tobacco-related health disparities and have not typically served as participants in mindfulness research). Research findings could be critical in moving forward the scientific study of mindfulness, improving patient outcomes in smoking cessation interventions, preventing cancer and other chronic diseases, and improving quality of life in diverse and underserved populations. The proposed training and research plan would launch Dr. Adams as an independent clinical scientist who conducts multidisciplinary research to inform, develop, evaluate, and disseminate innovative mindfulness- based interventions to improve health in diverse populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S., and mindfulness-based interventions show promise for improving smoking cessation. However, the mechanisms through which mindfulness impacts smoking are poorly understood.

"Defining the urban-rural continuum and distinguishing rural differences to prevent tobacco use ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substantial health disparities exist between rural and urban regions of the US. Adults in rural areas have among the highest smoking rates in the country: consuming more cigarettes and using more smokeless/spit tobacco when compared to their urban counterparts. Rural populations have worse health outcomes and lower cancer survival rates and have been historically underserved by tobacco control programs, lack access to prevention and cessation services and are less likely to have implemented protective tobacco control policies. In addition, rural areas have been treated as homogenous and the differences among these divergent areas have not been adequately researched. A further complication for research is the lack of a consistent definition of what is meant as rural so there are multiple measures of the urban-rural continuum. To assure that limited resources are appropriately targeting subgroups most at risk of smoking-related morbidity and mortality, we propose to develop an innovative methodology to define and measure this urban-rural continuum and apply this as a proof of concept to improve tobacco epidemiology and tobacco control research. Developing better measures will allow for a more comprehensive investigation of cancer risk factors that exist in rural regions. To accomplish this, we propose first to use the Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) at the individual level to develop and test an innovative methodology for urban-rural continuum measures. Second, we propose to use selected survey items from the TUS- CPS and link this data at the tract level to other Census data sets to investigate selected underlying factors that can identify specific rural differences. We will convene a panel of rural practitioners and academic experts to provide key stakeholder perspectives to validate and elucidate the findings. This innovative methodology will advance cancer research in an understudied topic and help explore differences in tobacco use across rural regions and populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rural residents face fewer tobacco control regulations than urban counterparts and rural tobacco use rates are significantly higher than urban rates, with direct linkages to poorer health outcomes. This project will examine government and methodological categorizations of rural isolation and apply the refined measures to improve the targeting of rural subgroups most at risk of smoking-related morbidity and mortality. Results will strengthen research methodology and inform public health campaigns and tobacco control policy and regulatory efforts, reducing the burden of tobacco-attributable diseases among rural populations.",Defining the urban-rural continuum and distinguishing rural differences to prevent tobacco use,9301499,R21CA205589,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Air ', ' Appalachian ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Behavior ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Larynx ', ' Malignant Laryngeal Tumor ', ' Malignant Laryngeal Neoplasm ', ' Larynx Cancer ', ' Laryngeal Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of larynx ', ' Censuses ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Spit Tobacco ', ' Chewing Tobacco ', ' Oral Tobacco ', ' Complication ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Laws ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Sex Differences in the Mechanisms that Promote Nicotine Reward and Withdrawal DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use remains a major public health and economic concern, particularly in women who are more vulnerable to the long-term health consequences of smoking than men. Despite the magnitude of the problem, there is a fundamental knowledge gap in our understanding of the mechanisms that promote tobacco use in females. If this knowledge gap is not filled, then reducing tobacco use and developing specialized medications for female smokers will remain largely incomprehensible. The long-term goal of our research program is to identify the mechanisms that mediate tobacco use among different clinical populations that are uniquely susceptible to this problem. The objective of this renewal is to determine the neural mechanisms that promote tobacco use in females. The central hypothesis is that females are more susceptible to tobacco use than males because of stronger rewarding effects of nicotine and heightened anxiety produced by withdrawal from this drug. Our mechanistic hypothesis is that estradiol (E2) promotes the rewarding effects of nicotine and magnifies the stress produced by nicotine withdrawal in females. More specifically, we postulate that sex differences in response to nicotine are modulated within the neural circuits of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), where dopamine is increased following nicotine administration and decreased during withdrawal from this drug. Thus, females experience greater rewarding effects of nicotine in the presence of E2, which promotes dopamine release in the NAcc. Following repeated nicotine exposure, opponent processes develop to counteract the chronic over-activation of dopamine release. We suggest that the emergence of these opponent processes is evident during withdrawal from chronic nicotine as an increase in the stress hormone, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in the NAcc. This increase in CRF levels enhances the inhibitory tone in the NAcc, which results in a decrease in dopamine release during nicotine withdrawal. Thus, females experience greater anxiety during nicotine withdrawal in the presence of E2, which promotes the recruitment of opponent stress systems that suppress dopamine release in the NAcc. The proposed studies reflect a multi- disciplinary approach involving neurochemical, behavioral, and gene transfer techniques to compare sex differences in the rewarding effects of nicotine (Aim 1) and the aversive states produced by withdrawal (Aim 2) because both of these factors are believed to promote tobacco use in females. The approach to studying sex differences involves comparisons of male, female, and OVX female rats. If the removal of ovarian hormones reverses the proposed measures in females, then the role of E2 will be assessed in OVX rats that will receive E2 supplementation and will be tested following E2 or vehicle administration. At the completion of this project, our findings will help us develop a unifying hypothesis regarding the factors that promote tobacco use in females. This exemplifies the significance of this research because a better understanding of the mechanisms that fuel tobacco use in females will lead to more effective treatments to reduce health disparities in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because our findings will be an important step toward elucidating the neural substrates that promote addiction pathology in women. Thus, our studies are relevant to the mission of NIH to support research aimed at reducing the burden of tobacco abuse, especially in women who are most vulnerable to the long-term effects of tobacco use.",Sex Differences in the Mechanisms that Promote Nicotine Reward and Withdrawal,9262890,R01DA021274,"['Anxiety ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' corticotropin releasing hormone ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticoliberin ', ' CRF-41 ', ' ACTH-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Dopamine ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estradiol ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' neurochemistry ', ' neurochemical ', ' Nicotine ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Withdrawal ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Self Administration ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' drug withdrawal ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Microdialysis ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Technology Transfer ', ' tobacco abuse ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dependence ', ' System ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' Infusion ', ' experience ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' novel ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Ovarian hormone ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' response ', ' Gene Transfer Techniques ', ' Transgenesis ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' Supplementation ', ' transfer of a gene ', ' Gene Transfer ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' health economics ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' anxiety-like behavior ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO,R01,2017,454076,0.09801115594627277
"Health Literacy and Smoking Cessation in Low-SES, Diverse Smokers ABSTRACT Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death and disability in the U.S., and is becoming increasingly concentrated among individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES) and racial/ethnic minorities. Nearly half of U.S. adults have difficulties with health literacy (HL), and lack the ability to obtain, understand, and use basic health information to make important decisions about healthcare. As with smoking, low HL is common among racial/ethnic minorities and those with low SES. Low HL is associated with negative health behaviors, less engagement in preventive services, and poor health outcomes. It is also associated with current smoking, key established predictors of smoking relapse, and smoking relapse, even after controlling for sociodemographic indicators. Thus, low HL appears to be an independent risk factor for poor cessation outcomes among low- SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers. Efforts are needed to elucidate mechanisms of the association between low HL and relapse, and to develop smoking cessation interventions targeting low HL smokers.  This project aims to: 1) investigate mechanisms through which HL influences smoking cessation in low- SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers enrolled in cessation treatment using secondary analyses of traditional questionnaire and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data from 2 smoking cessation treatment studies; 2) conduct a qualitative investigation with low HL smokers to further elucidate mechanisms of the association between HL and cessation and inform the development of a theoretically-based, cessation treatment targeting the specific needs of low HL smokers; 3) develop and evaluate the preliminary efficacy of a smoking cessation intervention targeting low HL smokers compared to standard treatment; and 4) examine treatment effects on secondary outcomes of interest (e.g., differential dropout, treatment satisfaction, intention to quit smoking). Results will elucidate the complex relations between HL and cessation in underserved smokers, guide treatment for low HL smokers, and contribute to reducing tobacco-related health disparities.  Diana Stewart Hoover, Ph.D. is seeking 5 years of support through a NIDA K23 Career Development Award for the proposed training and research. In order to fill critical gaps in her experience, she will obtain specialized training in behavioral intervention development targeting underserved populations, advanced statistics for analyzing longitudinal and EMA data, and qualitative methods, particularly mixed methods. She will also expand her knowledge and skills related to HL, tobacco cessation, health disparities, and research ethics. Her training and research plans will support her long-term goal of establishing an independently-funded research program in cancer prevention and tobacco cessation, with a focus on reducing tobacco-related health disparities for individuals with low HL. A comprehensive training plan is described, combining mentored research, structured mentorship activities guided by established researchers in the field, formal coursework and workshops, and participation in seminars at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Nearly half of United States adults have difficulty with health literacy, defined as ""the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions."" Individuals with health literacy difficulties are more likely to be current smokers and to have less knowledge about smoking health risks and more trouble quitting smoking, putting them at risk for poor health (e.g., more frequent diagnoses of advanced stage cancer) and premature mortality. Efforts are needed to understand mechanisms through which health literacy influences smoking cessation in order to help identify treatment targets for smokers with health literacy difficulties, improve current smoking cessation interventions, and ultimately reduce the burden of tobacco-related health disparities.","Health Literacy and Smoking Cessation in Low-SES, Diverse Smokers",9336284,K23DA040933,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dropout ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Occupational Status ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Services ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Preventing postpartum smoking relapse: a twitter-enabled supportive intervention Project Summary/Abstract An estimated 40% of women who smoke quit during their pregnancy, however, up to 80% of these women relapse in the postpartum period, despite the health risks for themselves and their children. Relapse prevention in the postpartum period offers a unique opportunity to capitalize on a positive behavioral change. Yet, the design of effective smoking interventions for postpartum relapse prevention is challenging, due in large part to the competing needs and stressors in this population, especially among low income women. New, innovative intervention delivery models are needed to provide high levels of social support for ongoing behavioral change, while simultaneously addressing the new demands associated with young babies. Twitter, one of the most popular microblogging social media platforms that facilitate an instant mode of communication via tweets (short texts), seems especially promising for delivering smoking cessation interventions among underserved populations. Guided by the Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing (C-SHIP) framework, as well as by health communication best practices, the proposed study will develop and test an evidence- based, cognitive-behavioral twitter-enabled system-generated and participant-driven intervention (Tweet2commit) designed to reduce postpartum smoking relapse among low-income minority women who have quit immediately before or during their pregnancies. The Tweet2commit will be developed through a systematic formative evaluation process that includes literature and evidence-based content review, followed by an iterative cycling of text drafting, health literacy evaluation of texts, review by targeted focus group and pre-test through usability testing. The overarching goal of Tweet2commit is to provide evidence-based information and cognitive-behavioral coping strategies, as well as to harness the potential of peer-mediated social interaction, for supporting smoking abstinence. The intervention will consist of: 1) system-generated tweets targeting C-SHIP-based relapse factors and 2) user-generated tweets: participants will be asked to tweet when commenting on the system-generated tweets or when experiencing needs for coping with lapse or relapse so their peer can respond accordingly. We will also use a combination of best practice strategies to engage online participation and peer-support exchange. A pilot RCT will be conducted to explore the efficacy of the Tweet2commit intervention on reducing postpartum relapse rates, compared to a Usual Care control. A mixed-methods approach including the analysis of objective Twitter usage data will be conducted to measure participant’s engagement and satisfaction as well as perceived barriers. The proposed research will be the first randomized controlled study that leverages the potential of Twitter for disseminating evidence-based smoking cessation strategies and harnessing the participatory nature of tweeting for live interactive mobile support groups among underserved postpartum women. The approach is innovative, evidence-based, highly transportable for wide scale dissemination, and can readily be applied to other substance abuse contexts. Project Narrative Tobacco smoking, the leading preventable cause of premature morbidity and mortality, is one of the most pressing public health issues that we face as a society, particularly among those who are from lower socio- economic minority communities. The proposed study is designed to develop and evaluate a theory-guided and social media-enabled intervention (Tweet2commit) to reduce postpartum smoking relapse among underserved women in order to improve both their health and the health of their children. The intervention has the potential for wide-scale dissemination into the current social media and health care delivery infrastructure, as it is evidence-based, highly transportable, and low-cost.",Preventing postpartum smoking relapse: a twitter-enabled supportive intervention,9337409,R21CA198036,"['Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Infant ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Postpartum Women ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expecting mother ', ' expectant mother ', ' Program Appropriateness ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Support Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Societies ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Emotional Stress ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' post-partum ', ' Postpartum ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Personality Traits ', ' satisfaction ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Smoker ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' disorder later incidence prevention ', ' relapse prevention ', ' recurrence prevention ', ' disorder recurrence prevention ', ' disease recurrence prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Childbirth ', ' child birth ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Community Health ', ' Text ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' social communication ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' usability ', ' smoking intervention ', ' pregnant ', ' information processing ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' efficacy testing ', ' smoking relapse ', ' public health priorities ', ' peer support ', ' social media ', ' formative assessment ', ' formative evaluation ', ' community partnership ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NCI,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R21,2017,238815,0.1360822972424939
"Expanding the Reach of a Validated Smoking-Cessation Intervention: A Spanish-language RCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco smoking is the leading preventable cause of cancer mortality. Pharmacotherapy and behavioral counseling have demonstrated independent and additive effects toward aiding smoking cessation; however, counseling is rarely chosen by smokers. In contrast, minimal self-help interventions, such as smoking cessation pamphlets or booklets have much wider potential reach, yet their efficacy has been largely disappointing, with incremental abstinence rates averaging only 1 percent. Given the high dissemination potential, any significant improvement in the efficacy of self-help would have high public health impact with respect to smoking and smoking related illness and mortality. In contrast to traditional self-help, a notable exception to the historically poor efficacy of self-help has been extended self-help that provides evidence-based content over a prolonged period of time. A recently completed trial of such an intervention, comprising 18 months of contact with a written social support component, revealed high efficacy throughout the 24-month follow-up period, as well as high cost- effectiveness. Wide-scale implementation and public health impact would be enhanced by the availability of a Spanish-language version to reach the largest and fastest growing ethnic minority population of smokers. The current smoking prevalence among Hispanic/Latino adults varies by cultural subgroup, with prevalence above 30 percent, for example, among those of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent. Greater smoking prevalence is also associated with lower income and education, and greater US acculturation. Prior research has demonstrated that Hispanic/Latino smokers face unique challenges such as lower awareness and acceptability of pharmacotherapies and less assistance with smoking cessation from their health providers. The goal of this study is to address this gap in cessation by conducting a randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of a culturally appropriate Spanish-language version of the existing validated self-help intervention. The efficacy of this intervention will be tested against two control conditions. The first, Usual Care, will consist of a traditional self-help intervention in Spanish. The second, Contact Control, will match the novel intervention on time and contact. These two control conditions address external and internal validity, respectively. It is hypothesized that, compared to both the Usual Care and the Contact Control conditions, the intervention will produce higher abstinence rates throughout 24 months of outcome assessment. Potential moderator variables will be evaluated to guide further refinement and targeting of the intervention. This would be the first study to test a Spanish-language adaptation of a validated self-help smoking cessation intervention in a nation-wide RCT. If efficacy is demonstrated in this study, a low-cost, easily disseminated, evidence-based intervention would be available, with the potential to reduce ethnic health disparities associated with tobacco smoking. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Research is needed to develop and validate interventions for ethnic minority smokers. The aim of the proposed study is to test a Spanish-language adaptation of a validated and easily implemented self-help intervention in a nation-wide clinical trial. Efforts aimed at promoting tobacco abstinence among this underserved population could have significant public health implications, including the potential reduction of ethnic health disparities associated with tobacco smoking.",Expanding the Reach of a Validated Smoking-Cessation Intervention: A Spanish-language RCT,9337417,R01CA199143,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Awareness ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Moderator Variables ', ' Epidemiologic Effect Modifiers ', ' Conditional Variables ', ' Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology) ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Language ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Letters ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Smoker ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' self help ', ' trait ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disorder later incidence prevention ', ' relapse prevention ', ' recurrence prevention ', ' disorder recurrence prevention ', ' disease recurrence prevention ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Dominican ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' High Prevalence ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' tobacco abstinence ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Abstinence ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' smoking intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' efficacy testing ', ' smoking relapse ', ' arm ', ' Preventable cancer cause ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' Cuban ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"A guided imagery tobacco cessation intervention delivered by a quitline and website ABSTRACT  Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of death accounting for more than 480,000 deaths each year, and 16 million Americans suffer from one or more diseases caused by smoking. Cessation of tobacco use can significantly reduce the risk of disease. Telephone quitlines are an effective and highly scalable way to help individuals quit smoking. However quitlines are an underutilized resource, and do not reach certain segments of the population, including males and racial/ethnic minorities. Guided imagery is a form of mind-body therapy that involves controlled visualization of specific mental images, and shares similarities with mindfulness meditation. Multiple studies have shown that exposure to mindfulness and imagery training results in significantly increased smoking abstinence rates. Also, imagery is used by a significant number of racially diverse male and female athletes. Although imagery is an effective tool for smoking  cessation, the mode of delivery has generally been in person, limiting the dissemination to large populations. We hypothesize that guided mental imagery delivered using the uitline “coaching model” combined with an interactive website could be an effective and disseminable intervention strategy. In addition, this model may be more readily accepted by underrepresented smokers, and may increase the reach and effectiveness of telephone quitlines. Therefore, the objective of this three year R34 application is to develop and test the feasibility of a theory-driven, telephone plus web-based, guided mental imagery intervention for smoking cessation. We will develop the intervention and attention-control condition, study procedures, training protocols, and competency testing models with input from quitline personnel, and focus and user groups of smokers in preparation for a randomized clinical trial. We will conduct a feasibility trial (N=100) to gather preliminary data on recruitment, retention, and preliminary estimates of the potential effects of the guided mental imagery intervention on quitline callers’ tobacco use, cravings, and self-efficacy to quit smoking. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the Imagery Intervention or a matched control condition delivered by project imagery coaches. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6-weeks and 6-months post-enrollment. Primary outcomes will be self-reported point prevalence and prolonged abstinence of tobacco use. A subsample of 20 quitters will be tested for salivary cotinine as biochemical validation of self-report in this population.  Secondary outcomes will be self-reported cravings and self-efficacy. A manual of procedures will be developed to prepare us to conduct a future randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of the imagery intervention. The proposed project has the potential to advance the science of tobacco cessation through the addition of guided mental imagery, and improve public health through increased reach of telephone quitlines. It is innovative in that it uses guided imagery to address theory-driven targets of self-efficacy for abstinence and cravings. If successful, this model could be expanded to address other health behaviors such as diet, physical activity and other substance use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tobacco use is still the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States. Tobacco quitlines are effective at helping smokers to quit, but they are underutilized, especially by men and racial/ethnic minorities. Guided imagery is effective at helping people quit smoking, and is appealing to males and diverse racial groups, but has limited reach. The proposed study will develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of a guided imagery tobacco cessation intervention that is delivered by a combination of quitline coaches and an interactive website.",A guided imagery tobacco cessation intervention delivered by a quitline and website,9352781,R34AT008947,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Scotine ', ' Cotinine ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Persons ', ' Nicotine ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Phonation ', ' Population Control ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Sports ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' buproprion ', ' Wellbutrin ', ' Amfebutamone ', ' Bupropion ', ' Competence ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Psychotherapeutic Imagery ', ' Guided imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Biochemical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' satisfaction ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Salivary ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' high school ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Devices ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Mind-Body Intervention ', ' mind body wellness ', ' mind body treatments ', ' mind body therapy ', ' mind body techniques ', ' mind body medicine skills ', ' mind body approach ', ' Mind-Body Medicine ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Validity of Self Report ', ' Preparation ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' tobacco abstinence ', ' tobacco control ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' mental imagery ', ' usability ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' mindfulness ', ' mindfulness meditation ', ' attentional control ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' ']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R34,2017,232980,0.2423780967475508
"Geographic variation in the diverse tobacco retail environment and its impact on tobacco use disparities ABSTRACT Amid declining cigarette consumption, sales of non-cigarette tobacco products remain strong. Importantly, the diverse products available in the current tobacco marketplace pose different levels of harm to the user. Combustible products such as cigarettes and cigars are higher on the tobacco risk continuum than non- combustible products such as smokeless tobacco and electronic cigarettes (e-cigs). Conceivably, smokers who switch to a non-combustible product may reduce their risk of smoking-related disease. This behavior, however, is significantly more common among whites compared to blacks, who have the highest rates of combustible tobacco use of any racial or ethnic group. Indeed, cigarette smoking rates are declining faster among whites than blacks, potentially driven by e-cig uptake. Differential rates of quitting smoking by switching to e-cigs or other non-combustible products may exacerbate existing health disparities between whites and blacks. Although tobacco use is influenced by several individual, interpersonal, and societal factors, the retail environment is known to play a critical role in shaping smoking behaviors, particularly among racial minorities, whom the tobacco industry has historically exploited. Despite the growing popularity of e-cigs and other non- cigarette tobacco products, little is known about the promotion of these products at the point-of-sale. This project will examine how the retail of diverse tobacco products varies across the U.S. and the extent to which it is associated with use behaviors of community residents. Specifically, this study will 1) investigate the relationship between regional tobacco product sales, tobacco control policies, and community demographics using Nielsen market scanner data and census data, 2) document the association between the local tobacco retail environment and tobacco product use using geocoded data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and store audits, and 3) model smoking-related disparities attributed to changes in tobacco use behaviors using repeated cross-sectional NHIS data and longitudinal data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study. PROJECT NARRATIVE The current tobacco marketplace in the United States is more diverse than ever, with consumption of cigars, smokeless tobacco, and electronic cigarettes remaining strong amid declining cigarette consumption.

"Optimizing remotely delivered Smoking Cessation Services for Low-Income Smokers ABSTRACT Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of cancer and many other deadly diseases, and the burden of tobacco use is greatest among those with limited socioeconomic resources. Although we have driven down population smoking rates, and with them, cancer rates, roughly 28% of the socioeconomically disadvantaged still smoke regularly. Low-income (L-I) smokers also develop cancer at higher rates and struggle more to quit than do higher-income smokers. These disparities in tobacco use and its burdens must be addressed. Highly effective cessation treatment services that can be delivered remotely, flexibly, and conveniently with few cost or logistical barriers have the potential to achieve this aim. Tobacco quitline and SmokefreeTXT services are such treatment resources with demonstrated attractiveness and reach among L-I smokers. The current proposal will use an efficient factorial design to evaluate 4 smoking cessation interventions with vast reach and dissemination potential. The target population will be N=1,408 Medicaid-eligible or uninsured smokers who have recently enrolled in the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line (WTQL), but who report continued smoking 4- months following engagement in standard WTQL services. These treatment non-responders will be invited to participate in an experiment that will randomize them to 1 of 2 levels of each of the following 4 factors in a 2X2X2X2 design: WTQL counseling intensity (1 session vs. 4 sessions), medication intensity (2-week nicotine patch monotherapy vs. 4-week nicotine patch and lozenge combination therapy), a supportive text messaging program (SmokefreeTXT vs. none), and financial incentives (rewards of up to $150 for treatment engagement vs. no treatment incentives). The primary outcome will be 26-week biochemically confirmed point-prevalence abstinence. Analyses will examine the main and interactive effects of these 4 treatment components on 26- week and secondary abstinence outcomes to identify the components and combinations of components that significantly enhance success in quitting in this high-risk population. This experiment will identify especially effective combinations of highly scalable interventions of modest cost and few barriers that could be disseminated nationally to reduce socioeconomic disparities in smoking cessation among those seeking to quit. Additional analyses will: compare intervention components and promising component combinations in terms of cost-effectiveness, examine whether or not treatment engagement differs across component combinations, examine baseline variables that may moderate treatment response, and identify mediators of treatment effects on abstinence outcomes. Because delivery of the study interventions can be centralized through established and efficient services (WTQL and SmokefreeTXT), the potential for both scalable dissemination and cost-effectiveness of the interventions tested is great. The proposed research will help identify ways to reduce tobacco cessation disparities in L-I smokers who have tried to quit smoking but relapsed and may benefit from improved assistance. NARRATIVE This experiment will identify scalable interventions that can be delivered to low-income smokers, a high-risk group with high smoking and low smoking-cessation rates, by phone or through the mail to help them quit smoking after a recent failed attempt to quit smoking. This research will suggest ways to most efficiently combine convenient interventions to improve success in quitting among low-income smokers who bear a disproportionate burden of tobacco use, relative to higher-income smokers.",Optimizing remotely delivered Smoking Cessation Services for Low-Income Smokers,9369617,R01CA218156,"['Policies ', ' Smoker ', ' nicotine patch ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Smoking History ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Abstinence ', ' treatment effect ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' smoking intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' intervention effect ', ' smoking relapse ', ' financial incentive ', ' follow up assessment ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Preventable cancer cause ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' cost-effectiveness evaluation ', ' evaluate cost-effectiveness ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' multimodality therapy ', ' combined treatment ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' Multimodality Treatment ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Engineering ', ' Incentives ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' Phonation ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Target Populations ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' falls ', ' Uninsured ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Biochemical ', ' Individual ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Logistics ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,608321,0.3020784884563009
"Addressing Psychological Risk Factors Underlying Smoking Persistence in COPD Patients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is caused primarily by smoking and smoking cessation is the first-line treatment for slowing disease progression. Despite this, nearly 50% of COPD patients continue to smoke following diagnosis. Smokers with COPD report high rates of co-occurring conditions – nicotine dependence, depression, and anxiety – which serve as barriers to quitting. The proposed research will develop and pilot test a behavioral intervention designed to target the common psychological factors underlying these co-occurring conditions and foster smoking cessation among COPD patients.  Primary aims of the proposed research are to: 1) Refine behavioral treatment components through qualitative interviews with patients and providers, 2) Develop a tailored behavioral treatment to address psychological risk factors among COPD patients using single case design experiments, and 3) Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effects of the multi-component intervention on smoking outcome, as compared to minimally-enhanced usual care. The proposed project will be the first to adapt a behavioral treatment to specifically target psychological risk factors among COPD patients who smoke. By addressing core psychological risk factors, the behavioral treatment may help buffer against stress associated with disease progression and increase COPD patients' exercise tolerance, engagement in pulmonary rehabilitation, and quality of life. Thus, this intervention has potential to obviate a large number of health burdens among COPD patients, and ultimately to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with COPD.  Amanda Mathew, PhD, a Research Assistant Professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, is seeking five years of support through the K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award for training and research related to development and testing of smoking cessation interventions targeted to psychological risk factors among COPD patients. Dr. Mathew's overarching career goals are to elucidate the mechanisms by which psychological factors impact cigarette smoking, develop novel interventions for smokers with medical and psychiatric comorbidities, and reduce tobacco-related health disparities. Through the proposed training plan, Dr. Mathew will expand her knowledge and skills related to intervention development; behavioral RCT design, conduct, and analysis; and smoking cessation and treatment needs specific to individuals with COPD. Dr. Mathew's multidisciplinary mentorship team has demonstrated expertise in these content areas, and is committed to Dr. Mathew's career development. Dr. Mathew's proposed work is also well-aligned with behavioral medicine research priorities within the Department of Preventive Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Although individuals diagnosed with COPD have high rates of nicotine dependence, depression, and anxiety, there is very limited understanding of the psychological risk factors that commonly drive these conditions and how they can be addressed through targeted treatment.

"Yale SCOR on Gender-Sensitive Treatment for Tobacco Dependence     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Yale-SCOR is bringing together leading basic and clinical science experts to establish an interdisciplinary, translational, cross-species program of research aimed at identifying novel therapeutics to address the critical health disparity that female smokers face. Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States. Women, compared to men, have poorer rates of smoking cessation, exacerbated health risks, and FDA-approved medications for smoking cessation may not be as effective for women or have emerging limits due to side effects. However, few attempts have been made to develop gender-sensitive smoking cessation treatments. The considerable body of data suggesting that women are more likely to smoke to regulate negative affect and stress while men are more likely to smoke for the reinforcing properties of nicotine suggests an important direction in the development of a new approach to smoking cessation treatments. Using both preclinical and clinical strategies, our interdisciplinary team will probe te noradrenergic system's effects on stress-reactivity and nicotine reinforcement -hypothesizing that (a) different brain systems modulated by noradrenergic activity are activated by smoking in women and men, and (b) guanfacine (an alpha-2a noradrenergic agonist) can preferentially target these gender-sensitive systems to improve smoking cessation outcomes. Using a translational approach with an interdisciplinary team effort, we are proposing three projects that will have inter-related and shared goals, with each providing unique contributions to the development of gender-sensitive therapeutics. This new application will catalyze Yale's significant resources to support interdisciplinary and translational science in women's health to pursue extremely timely scientific findings that could represent a breakthrough in our understanding of treatments for a public health problem that affects millions daily. Our specific aims and objectives of the Yale-SCOR are to:    AIM 1: Evaluate the role of the noradrenergic system and its interactions with cholinergic and dopaminergic systems, in stress-induced smoking relapse and nicotine-based reinforcement, and use these findings to inform and expedite the development of gender-sensitive therapeutics for smoking cessation.    AIM 2: Mentor junior investigators in conducting interdisciplinary translational research on tobacco use and women's health through training opportunities, including ""clerkships"" with SCOR PIs, and pilot funding.    AIM 3: Be a national resource to invigorate and galvanize the study of sex and gender differences in relation to smoking by providing expert consultation; supporting faculty training awards; mining national data on gender, smoking and health outcomes to inform health policy; and expanding our current program of local and national community outreach.          Women compared to men, have poorer rates of smoking cessation and exacerbated health risks yet few attempts have been made to develop gender-sensitive smoking cessation treatments. This research will contribute to the public health by providing a neurobiologically-informed approach to the development of gender-sensitive therapeutics for smoking cessation, mentoring the next generation of interdisciplinary and translational researchers, and providing a national resource for women's health and tobacco use.            ",Yale SCOR on Gender-Sensitive Treatment for Tobacco Dependence,9476462,P50DA033945,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' California ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' CellLine ', ' Cell Line ', ' Cities ', ' Consultations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Coloring Agents ', ' Dyes ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' London ', ' Los Angeles ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Names ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Public Health ', ' Registries ', ' Psychological reinforcement ', ' Reinforcement ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Guanfacine ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Funding ', ' Agonist ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Smoker ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Consult ', ' Services ', ' Church ', ' cholinergic ', ' noradrenergic ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Property ', ' Withholding Treatment ', ' Cessation of Treatment ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' human embryonic stem cell ', ' human ESC ', ' human ES cell ', ' hESC ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Province ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' First Name ', ' Last Name ', ' Smoking and Health ', ' Smoking and Health Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Instruction ', ' performance site ', ' next generation ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' translational approach ', ' translational strategy ', ' translation strategy ', ' FDA approved ', ' smoking relapse ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' teacher development ', ' instructor training ', ' faculty professional development ', ' faculty development ', ' Teacher Training ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Faculty Education ', ' stress reactivity ', ' faculty support ', ' training opportunity ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' translational scientist ', ' translational researcher ', ' translational investigator ', ' ']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,P50,2017,525000,0.2871159896441585
"Gain-framed Messages and NRT Sampling to Promote Smoking Cessation in Lung Cancer Screening Programs PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lung cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in the U.S. In addition to primary prevention (tobacco control), secondary prevention through early detection with low-dose CT scans is recognized as a technique to identify earlier stage, more treatable lung cancers in high-risk patients. Evidence from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that lung cancer screening with low-dose CT scans for high risk individuals (>30 pack years of smoking, <15 yr quit-time, and 55-74 yrs of age) conferred a 20% reduction in mortality for those patients who received 3 annual low dose CT scans. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently issued a final recommendation for annual screening for lung cancer in these high risk individuals, and many insurers now cover the screening. The present study is thus timely and novel – we will investigate whether we can achieve higher rates of short- and long-term cessation in this high risk population. We will conduct a 2 x 2 (gain-framed intervention vs. unframed intervention, starter package of 2 weeks of nicotine patches and lozenges vs. no medication) study to evaluation methods to boost rates of smoking cessation for a high-risk group of smokers (N=616) with varying levels of motivation across 2 study sites (MUSC, Yale). Participants will be identified through the MUSC and Yale lung cancer screening programs at both sites. Randomization will be stratified by study site and level of motivation. The primary hypothesis is that rates of smoking cessation will be significantly higher at 6-months after lung screening for the smoking cessation strategy involving a gain-framed intervention + 2 weeks of nicotine patches and lozenges compared to a strategy of an unframed behavioral intervention + no medication. Our secondary hypothesis is that rates of smoking cessation will be higher for the gain-framed intervention group vs. the unframed intervention group and the starter package of 2 weeks of nicotine patches and lozenges group vs. the no medication group. On an exploratory basis we will also examine mediators and moderators of treatment. We hypothesize that changes in self-efficacy, smoking cessation outcome expectancy, familiarization with NRT, motivation, and autonomy will act as mechanisms for the smoking cessation effects (i.e., will act as mediators of treatment). We also hypothesize that lung screening findings (e.g., presence of a nodule, cancer, etc), nicotine dependence, and health disparities will modify treatment response (i.e., will act as baseline moderators of treatment). This project is designed to be translational (in that it can be transferable from our controlled efficacy study to other lung screening programs at other institutions) as all of our media will be digital files ready for sharing, the procedures for NRT sampling will be easily copied, and the print materials can be provided as fillable templates for personalization. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recently approved annual lung cancer screening as a benefit for individuals: (1) ages 55-77 years old; (2) asymptomatic (no signs of lung cancer illness); (3) tobacco smoking history of at least 30 pack-years; and (4) report current smoking or quit smoking within the past 15 years. While one might hypothesize that simply having a CT scan may promote cessation, evidence suggests that having a scan increases quit rates only slightly, if there is any increase at all. Most patients presenting for screening will have variable motivation to quit smoking, with many of them lacking motivation to quit. Studying smoking cessation interventions in the context of lung cancer screening has the potential to improve cessation rates for this high-risk group of smokers.",Gain-framed Messages and NRT Sampling to Promote Smoking Cessation in Lung Cancer Screening Programs,9349467,R01CA207229,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Elements ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nodule ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Smoking ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer early detection ', ' Lung Cancer screening ', ' Screening for Lung Cancer ', ' Smoker ', ' nicotine patch ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' programs ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' low-dose helical computed tomography ', ' low-dose CT ', ' low dose computed tomography ', ' low-dose spiral CT ', ' Smoking History ', ' beneficiary ', ' tobacco control ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' treatment effect ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' high risk ', ' group intervention ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' screening ', ' Patient risk ', ' treatment group ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' efficacy study ', ' ']",NCI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2017,592850,0.2175451531997429
"LGBT Adults and Tobacco Stigma: A Qualitative Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary focus of this proposed study is to consider the potential unintended consequences of tobacco denormalization strategies for LGBT adults. In particular, we will examine the processes of stigmatization as they relate to tobacco denormalization, tobacco use, and sexual and gender identities. This project expands our research portfolio on tobacco-related stigma. Currently we are funded to examine perceptions of tobacco denormalization among African American young adults in California. We will address the following aims: 1. Understand perceptions of tobacco denormalization strategies and related beliefs and attitudes about the stigmatization of tobacco among LGBT smokers and former smokers in California; 2. Examine the ways in which the stigmatization of tobacco use may intersect with sexual and gender identity stigmas; 3. Explore alternative strategies that may be more effective in reducing the prevalence of smoking among  LGBT adults in California. This study includes 2 phases. In Phase 1, we will conduct asynchronous online group interviews in 10 forums where LGBT adults meet and engage online. Phase 2 will consist of 240 in-depth qualitative interviews conducted with LGBT adults who live in California. The sample will be stratified by sexual/gender identity status, smoking status (current smoker/former smoker), and age (young adults/adults) with 15 participants included in each cell. Complementing online group interviews with in-person individual interviews will help to reveal group norms and beliefs as well as the plurality of beliefs within the group to yield a more holistic understanding of study aims. Using a pattern-level approach to the analysis of the narrative data from phases 1 and 2, we will investigate the processes of tobacco-related stigmatization and its relationship to tobacco denormalization for LGBT adults, as well as how the overlapping stigmas of other social identities may shape the experience of tobacco-related stigma for LGBT adults. Results from the study will be disseminated through traditional conference presentations and academic journal publications, as well as through a project website that includes an accessible presentation of study findings and a social media forum to solicit feedback from study participants and people concerned about the high prevalence of smoking among LGBT adults. This application has important implications for developing an alternative and more equitable tobacco prevention strategy that minimizes rather than exacerbates health inequities for LGBT adults. Moreover, this project is situated within a broader public health framework that investigates reasons for unresponsiveness and/or resistance to social norming policies among marginalized minority groups. Findings from this study may have important implications for other types of public health policies as well as implications for researching the persistence of smoking among other minority groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will consider the potential unintended consequences of tobacco denormalization strategies for LGBT adults in California. In particular, we will examine the processes of stigmatization as they relate to tobacco denormalization, tobacco use, and sexual and gender identities. Results from this project will shed light on why tobacco denormalization strategies are less effective for LGBT adults as well as to conceptualize and develop alternative approaches that may be more effective for reducing the prevalence of smoking among LGBT adults.",LGBT Adults and Tobacco Stigma: A Qualitative Study,9320528,R01CA190238,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Attitude ', ' Belief ', ' California ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Feedback ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Interview ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Change ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Societies ', ' Stigmatization ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Woman ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policies ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Funding ', ' Shapes ', ' Smoker ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' behavior change ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Iatrogenesis ', ' iatrogenicity ', ' iatrogenically ', ' iatrogenic ', ' Smoking Status ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' tobacco control ', ' tobacco use prevention ', ' prevent tobacco use ', ' tobacco prevention ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' public health relevance ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex ', ' LGBTI ', ' transgender women ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' transgender men ', ' transmen ', ' transman ', ' trans-men ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' social media ', ' ']",NCI,PACIFIC INSTITUTE FOR RES AND EVALUATION,R01,2017,455448,0.16029002379011903
"Use and Effectiveness of Tobacco Pharmacotherapy: A Phase IV Sex Difference Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women experience significant disparities with regards to smoking cessation, and research has identified key factors underlying poor treatment response including differential response to smoking cessation medications. Despite this knowledge, findings have yet to translate into improved clinical outcomes for smoking cessation, and current guidelines provide little information on sex-based practices. One critical barrier for the translation to clinical practice is the lack of evidence from Phase-IV population-based studies. To date, evidence has exclusively emerged from Phase-III clinical trial data; sex differences in real-world effectiveness of stop smoking medications remain unknown. We will conduct a Phase-IV pharmacoepidemiologic study of sex differences in smoking cessation effectiveness in a U.S. nationally representative sample. [[[E-cigarette use during cessation attempts and associations with quitting will also be examined.]]] Our study will be a secondary analysis of the first wave of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study (scheduled to be released in the Fall of 2015), which was initiated and funded by NIDA and the FDA. The study's large sample size (~59,000) and its inclusion of information on medication/e-cigarette use during attempts to stop smoking will present a unique and unprecedented opportunity to address the study's aims. The project will also serve as the foundation for an R01 application for subsequent analyses of longitudinal waves of PATH data. [[[Our primary aim will be to examine sex differences in the real world comparative effectiveness of smoking cessation medications, using both regression and propensity score approaches, and following published guidelines for medication effectiveness studies using secondary data sources.]]] Data from current and former smokers who attempted to quit smoking (either successfully or unsuccessfully) at least once during the 12 months prior to their interview (n~8,215; 4,240 men and 3,975 women) will be analyzed. The investigation will examine the comparative effectiveness of the following medications: nicotine replacement therapy (the patch, oral NRT, nasal spray), varenicline/Chantix, and bupropion/Wellbutrin/Zyban. We will explore whether sex differences in medication effectiveness are moderated by education level, annual income, race/ethnicity, nicotine dependence level, and mental health. [[[We will also explore sex differences in associations between use of e-cigarettes during cessation attempts and likelihood of successful cessation.]]] This study addresses the National Institute on Drug Abuse's (NIDA) call for projects that ""assess the differential effectiveness of current drug abuse treatments in males and females"" (PA-14-037: Women & Sex/Gender Differences in Drug and Alcohol/Dependence). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Evidence from clinical trials suggests smoking cessation medications (e.g., nicotine patch, varenicline/Chantix, bupropion/Wellbutrin/Zyban) may be more or less effective depending on the sex of the smoker. However, these differences in medication effectiveness have not been studied among smokers trying to quit in real world contexts.

"Development of a Telephone-Based Individual Smoking Cessation Program for American Indians ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians (AI) have the highest rates of smoking of any racial/ethnic group in the United States (41% versus 23% for whites and blacks). Consequently, they suffer the highest mortality from tobacco-related illnesses of any racial/ethnic group; two of every five AI die from a tobacco-related illness. Despite the abysmal rates of smoking and tobacco-related illness among AI, few researchers have addressed this important issue, in part because tobacco is a sacred plant to many AI and, as such, cannot be treated completely negatively, as most smoking cessation programs do. Researchers at the University of Kansas Medical Center, Center for American Indian Community Health have been using community-based participatory research (CBPR) to address recreational tobacco use in the AI community since 2003 and have developed a successful culturally-tailored smoking cessation program, All Nations Breath of Life (ANBL), that respects tobacco as a sacred plant and promotes honoring it rather than abusing it recreationally. Our in- person program currently has quit rates of 31% at 6-months post-baseline (P<0.001 compared to the best previously reported program for a multi-tribal population). Though we have experienced success through an intensive, in-person program, we are unable to reach the entire AI community with this program. Therefore, we propose the development and pilot testing of a telephone-based program with an accompanying interactive website to reach a larger AI population. We will address the following specific aims: (1) To develop an individual telephone-based version of ANBL and accompanying interactive website; (2) To conduct a formative test of the program (N=10) to determine modifications needed for the pilot; and (3) To pilot test tANBL in 80 AI smokers and estimate effect size of the intervention. Our primary endpoint will be 30-day point prevalence abstinence from recreational smoking biochemically verified by salivary cotinine level at 6 months post- baseline. We hypothesize that quit rates in tANBL will be significantly better than those currently reported in the literature for AI in untailored programs (30% versus 10%). We will address the following secondary aims: (1) To maximize and assess the cultural relevance of the intervention program and all of its components; (2) To examine the acceptability and feasibility of implementing an individual telephone-based ANBL; (3) To examine reasons for relapse among those smokers who were quit at 12 weeks and relapsed at 6 months; (4) To examine continuous abstinence rates for tANBL; and (5) To examine reduction in cigarettes per day among non-quitters. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: American Indians suffer greater tobacco-related health disparities than any other ethnic group in the United States due to their high rates of smoking. By targeting tobacco use, this project addresses both the leading cause of cancer death and the overall leading cause of death among American Indians through the implementation and testing of an individual telephone-based, culturally tailored smoking cessation program based on our successful All Nations Breath of Life in-person, group-based program. If successful, this project has the potential to greatly reduce cigarette smoking and the resulting negative health outcomes among American Indians by reaching a greater number of smokers than our in-person program.",Development of a Telephone-Based Individual Smoking Cessation Program for American Indians,9275930,R21CA203568,"['American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Scotine ', ' Cotinine ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Kansas ', ' Literature ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Missouri ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Plants ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoking ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Biochemical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Smoker ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Salivary ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' intervention program ', ' Cigarette ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Reporting ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Smoking Status ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' tobacco control ', ' urban Indian ', ' urban American Indian ', ' urban Native American ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Abstinence ', ' community organizations ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' public health relevance ', ' arm ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2017,164213,0.1725946034621307
"Rescuing Cognitive and Emotional Regulatory Processes to Aid Smoking Prevention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research to date provides overwhelming evidence that low socio-economic status (SES) youth are at an increased risk for smoking. Converging evidence from developmental studies, psychopathology studies, intervention studies, and basic research on self-control abilities, have identified working memory and distress tolerance as potential crucial modifiable risk factors to prevent smoking onset in this cohort. To confirm the value of these targets, this study is designed to evaluate the individual and combined influence of working memory and distress tolerance interventions on risk of smoking initiation. We are targeting a high-risk (low SES adolescents) population at a highly relevant period (high school) for smoking onset, and studying crucial covariates--parental smoking, peer smoking, and sensation seeking -- of particular relevance to the study cohort in order to provide more-precise estimates of the influence of the experimental variables and to more fully characterize variables of influence for the population under study. The effects of the interventions are studied against a backdrop of a standard antismoking informational intervention - the sort of intervention that has shown less success with low SES adolescents. Overall, we propose to randomize at least 150 adolescents to one of three intervention conditions: (1) a control condition offering health education combined with a smoking prevention informational intervention (C+SPII), (2) a working memory intervention delivered prior to a smoking prevention informational intervention (WM+SPII), and (3) a distress tolerance training intervention delivered prior to a smoking prevention informational intervention (DI+SPII). The effect of these conditions on proximal smoking risk variables as well as one-year smoking outcomes will be assessed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most smokers begin smoking before the age of 18 years, and rates of smoking initiation are higher for low-income youth. This project is designed to provide fundamental knowledge to inform drug prevention interventions by attending to working memory and distress tolerance as crucial risk factors for smoking initiation among low-income youth. We will study the usefulness of interventions designed to enhance working memory capacity and distress tolerance for reducing proximal risk for smoking and actual smoking behavior among low-income high school students.",Rescuing Cognitive and Emotional Regulatory Processes to Aid Smoking Prevention,9247772,R21DA041531,"['Advertising ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Maintenance ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Nicotine ', ' Poverty ', ' Probability ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Self-control as a personality trait ', ' self control ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Reporting ', ' emotional distress ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' brief intervention ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Low income ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' anti-smoking ', ' Antismoking ', ' Cognitive ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Smoking Prevention ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' discount ', ' virtual ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' discounting ', ' Population ', ' 18 year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' 18 years of age ', ' modifiable risk ', ' Affective ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' intervention effect ', ' brief prevention intervention ', ' brief preventive intervention ', ' distress tolerance ', ' coping mechanism ', ' High School Student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' affective disturbance ', ' mindfulness intervention ', ' mindfulness-based intervention ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' ']",NIDA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R21,2017,201279,0.18261269411930536
"Smoke-free Air Coalitions in Georgia and Armenia: A Community Randomized Trial SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Public health efforts in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) could be catalyzed by bolstering ways to optimally leverage local talents and resources, such as civil society. Developing effective models for aligning civil society and governmental public health at the local level in LMICs has the potential to impact a range of chronic diseases and risk factors, including tobacco. Local coalitions have been a dominant strategy in tobacco control in the US, with well-documented success in establishing smoke-free policies specifically. However, this approach has not been widely leveraged or well-studied in LMICs or those with less democratic traditions than the US. Instead, in many LMICs, smoke-free policy progress is largely initiated at the national level. Parallel civil society movements at the local level may be needed to build support for and compliance with policies. Given their sociopolitical histories and high tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) rates, Georgia (GE) and Armenia (AM) are two strategic settings for the proposed work. The smoking prevalence is 57.7% and 52.3% in men (6th and 11th highest in the world) and 5.7% and 1.5% in women, respectively. Moreover, our findings indicate extremely high rates of SHSe. However, we also documented high receptivity to public smoke-free policies despite high use rates, particularly in worksites and restaurants. This proposal is a well-justified extension of the literature and our prior work. We will build the capacity of GE and AM researchers to conduct high-quality mixed methods tobacco research and test the Community Coalition Action Theory as a framework for impacting local community-driven policy change. Researchers from the GE National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) and AM National Institute of Health (NIH) will collaborate with Emory to execute the proposed research, train tobacco control researchers within their organizations and partnering universities, and train practitioners within local communities to build local coalitions for tobacco control policy. We aim to: 1) conduct a matched-pair community randomized controlled trial in 28 municipalities in GE and AM to examine the impact of local coalitions promoting the adoption of smoke-free policies in worksites and restaurants, with the primary outcome of changes in SHSe over time; 2) assess how community context and coalition factors influence adoption of organizational and municipal smoke-free policies to provide an evidence- base for public health practice; 3) disseminate research findings regarding both the effectiveness and the process of establishing and maintaining coalitions, and consequently increasing smoke-free policies and reducing SHSe, to key stakeholders in GE and AM; and 4) capitalize on the proposed research and dissemination opportunities to build tobacco control research capacity within the GE NCDC, AM NIH, and partnering universities, as well as practice capacity within local public health centers and their civil society partners. Ultimately, the activities outlined in this proposal will serve as a catalyst for future action-oriented science and evidence-based practice to support tobacco control progress in this region more broadly. PROJECT NARRATIVE Developing effective models for aligning civil society and governmental public health at the local level in LMICs has the potential to impact a range of chronic diseases and risk factors, including tobacco. In this proposal, we will partner with the national public health agencies in Georgia and Armenia – two countries with extremely high rates of smoking and secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) and with sociopolitical histories not conducive to local activism; we will examine: 1) the impact of local coalitions promoting smoke-free policies in worksites and restaurants on SHSe in these challenging environments and 2) how community context and coalition factors influence adoption of organizational and municipal smoke-free policies. We will capitalize on the proposed research to build tobacco control research capacity in our partnering institutions, as well as practice capacity within local communities; results will be disseminated in order to serve as a catalyst for future action- oriented science and evidence-based practice to support tobacco control progress in this region.",Smoke-free Air Coalitions in Georgia and Armenia: A Community Randomized Trial,9372431,R01TW010664,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Air ', ' Armenia ', ' Attention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Influentials ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Talents ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Workplace ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Policies ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Municipalities ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' research data dissemination ', ' research dissemination ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Advocate ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Tobacco Control Research ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' tobacco control ', ' Population ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' civil society ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' smoke-free policy ', ' environmental tobacco smoke exposure ', ' secondhand smoke exposure ', ' second hand smoke exposure ', ' exposure to tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to cigarette smoke ', ' exposure to SHS ', ' exposure to ETS ', ' cigarette smoke exposure ', ' model building ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' sex disparity ', ' disparities in sex ', ' ']",FIC,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,331181,0.10357744783394394
"Behavioral Economic Approach to Reducing Maternal Smoking in Disadvantaged Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking among women is a substantial U.S. public health problem that is highly associated with socioeconomic status, especially low educational attainment. It is also a direct contributor to health disparities. For example, smoking prevalence in the U.S. exceeds 30 percent among women with < 12 years of education compared to less than 6 percent for women with graduate degrees. Smoking prevalence among disadvantaged mothers is at strikingly high levels (40-60 percent). Disadvantaged women begin smoking at an earlier age, are heavier smokers, and are more likely to be nicotine dependent and to fail at smoking cessation. Not surprisingly, disadvantaged women are also at increased risk for smoking-related adverse health outcomes, including adversely impacting the health of their children through in-utero and second-hand smoke exposure (SHSe). Despite widespread awareness of the adverse health consequences of SHSe, almost 85 percent of U.S. children from low-income families are chronically exposed. SHSe, especially from maternal smoking, increases risk for infant death, chronic respiratory infections, asthma, and other longer-term medical problems, and is estimated to increase direct medical and life-lost costs in the U.S. by > $5 billion annually. Efficacious interventions to increase maternal smoking cessation and reduce childhood SHSe are sorely needed. In this application we are proposing to test the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an intervention for promoting smoking-cessation among economically disadvantaged mothers of young children (< 11 yrs) that is based in the conceptual framework of behavioral economics and uses financial incentives to motivate behavior change. We are proposing to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing (1) usual care for smoking cessation and reducing SHSe among children, (2) usual care combined with financial incentives for objectively verified smoking abstinence and (3) usual care combined with financial incentives and also with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) using innovative procedures to enhance medication efficacy. We hypothesize that both interventions involving financial incentives will increase biochemically-verified smoking abstinence in mothers and decrease SHSe in their children, but that the largest and most cost-effective treatment effects will be achieved by combining financial incentives with NRT. Behavioral-economic measures of decision-making biases and cigarette-price sensitivity will be examined as predictors of treatment response. Overall, the proposed study has the potential to advance knowledge on efficacious, cost-effective smoking cessation for maternal smokers and protection against SHSe in children. The study also has the potential to impact policies and clinical practices regarding recommended care for combating chronic SHSe in disadvantaged children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are proposing to examine new strategies for helping economically disadvantaged mothers of young children to quit smoking and better protect their children from the harmful effects of being regularly exposed to cigarette smoke. We are especially interested in whether offering financial incentives for quitting and medications to reduce nicotine withdrawal might increase the proportion of mothers who successfully quit smoking and reduce smoke exposure and related illnesses among their children.",Behavioral Economic Approach to Reducing Maternal Smoking in Disadvantaged Women,9272274,R01HD078332,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Scotine ', ' Cotinine ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Health ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mothers ', ' Nicotine ', ' Nicotine Withdrawal ', ' Pregnancy Complications ', ' pregnancy-related complications ', ' complications during pregnancy ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Respiratory Tract Infections ', ' Respiratory Infections ', ' Risk ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' smoke of cigarettes ', ' cigarette smoke ', ' Policies ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' infant death ', ' infantile death ', ' infant demise ', ' death in first year of life ', ' Services ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Cigarette ', ' Participant ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Reporting ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effectiveness analyses ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Intake ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Community Practice ', ' Process ', ' discount ', ' in utero ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' motivated behavior ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' maternal smoking ', ' maternal cigarette smoking ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' discounting ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' treatment effect ', ' trial comparing ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' clinical practice ', ' efficacy testing ', ' financial incentive ', ' follow up assessment ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' behavioral economics ', ' environmental tobacco smoke exposure ', ' secondhand smoke exposure ', ' second hand smoke exposure ', ' exposure to tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to cigarette smoke ', ' exposure to SHS ', ' exposure to ETS ', ' cigarette smoke exposure ', ' Community of Practice ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictive of treatment response ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' lower income families ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2017,586995,0.20551022567533364
"Randomized Trial of an Innovative Smartphone Intervention for Smoking Cessation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is tremendous need for smoking cessation intervention technologies with strong potential population-level impact at the lowest possible cost. That potential can be found in the newest technological innovation in quit smoking interventions: smartphone-based smoking cessation software applications (""apps""). There are over 400 smoking cessation apps, which were downloaded in the United States 3.2 million times during the two-year period 2012 to 2013. No trials of any app's effectiveness for general adult cessation have been published and no NIH-funded cessation intervention trials are in progress-despite the fact this is a high priority NIH funding topic. The enormous usage of smoking cessation apps contrasted with their unknown effectiveness creates a serious scientific gap that could stifle their population-level impact.  Research on US Clinical Practice Guidelines (USCPG) apps begins to address that research gap. But only following the USCPG has had limitations in other modalities of delivery. An approach, called Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), addresses these limitations with both innovative intervention content and highly promising results from six published trials. ACT's innovation is its dual focus on increasing willingness to experience physical cravings, emotions, and thoughts that cue smoking while making values-guided committed behavior changes. We recently developed the first ACT app for smoking cessation, called ""SmartQuit,"" and tested it in a pilot randomized controlled trial (N  196), comparing it with an app that follows USCPG (National Cancer Institute's ""QuitGuide""). Results showed that SmartQuit had: (1) higher participant engagement and satisfaction than QuitGuide, (3) higher levels of acceptance of cravings than QuitGuide, and (3) descriptively higher quit rates (albeit non-significant) than QuitGuide at the two-month follow-up.  Building on these promising results, we propose a fully-powered three-arm randomized controlled trial (n = 811 per arm) that compares SmartQuit to QuitGuide and each app to the NCI's Clearing the Air booklet, which follows the USCPG, to definitively determine whether (1) an USCPG app is more efficacious than a USCPG self-help booklet; (2) an ACT app is more efficacious than a USCPG booklet; (3) an ACT app is more efficacious than a USCPG app.  As millions of people are choosing smartphone apps to help them quit smoking, this innovative study shows exciting promise for improving the success rates of quit smoking apps and thereby lowering healthcare costs and reducing premature tobacco-related deaths. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over the two-year period of 2012-2013, smartphone applications for smoking cessation reached 3.2 million people in the United States and their reach is climbing rapidly. This randomized trial will definitively test a smartphone application-delivered Acceptance & Commitment Therapy intervention for adult smoking cessation.

"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 African American smokers attempting to quit.",Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers,9537132,R01MD010362,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Poverty ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Volition ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Letters ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' interest ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' demographics ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' public health relevance ', ' mindfulness ', ' distress tolerance ', ' social health determinants ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' built environment ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' data to knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2017,810198,0.2244692431251016
"In Vivo Experience with NRT to Increase Adherence and Smoking Abstinence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking remains the leading cause of death and disability in the United States, resulting in death for 1 out of every 2 smokers. While smoking rates have declined to about 18% among the general population, smoking rates still remain disproportionately high among individuals in the criminal justice system (i.e., 70-80%). Despite this high rate of smoking, few interventions have been tested in this population. We were the first to investigate providing 12 weeks of bupropion to a sample of community corrections smokers and then randomizing them to either four sessions of smoking cessation counseling or no counseling to quit. No significant differences were found between our two groups, indicating no additional benefit from more intensive smoking cessation counseling. However, while only 5.8% were abstinent at the 6 month follow-up, abstinence rates were quadrupled among the minority of those who were adherent to medication. Developing interventions to increase medication adherence has been cited as the most important means to reducing disparities; however, the few interventions that have investigated increasing adherence have been psychoeducational only and have yielded poor results. But evidence from our previous work demonstrated that smokers who had previous experience using bupropion had higher subsequent cessation rates and this relationship was mediated by improved medication adherence. Thus, exposure to medication is very likely the critical factor in improving subsequent adherence. The current application proposes a randomized controlled trial to maximize medication adherence with this population of smokers by testing an In Vivo NRT experiential intervention. Participants randomized to the In Vivo intervention will try a nicotine patch in Session 1, try nicotine gum in Session 2, try combination nicotine replacement therapy (cNRT) in Session 3, and discuss any problems with use of cNRT for a quit attempt in Session 4. During each 30-minute session they will discuss their expectations for the medication as well as the In Vivo session effects of these medications on withdrawal symptomatology, including urge to smoke. Between sessions, participants will be given medication to use during that week to make practice quit attempts and to become familiar with the medication. Participants randomized to the control group will receive four 30-minute sessions of standard behavioral counseling. All participants will receive cNRT for 10 weeks. Follow-ups will occur up to six months post-intervention. Primary outcomes include 6 month point prevalence abstinence and abstinence across time as well as medication adherence. If successful, this intervention could provide an easily transportable, novel, and tailored intervention to increase medication adherence and improve smoking cessation rates among smokers in the criminal justice system to reduce health disparities and save lives. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Smoking is now concentrated in high risk and disadvantaged populations such as individuals in the criminal justice system.

"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 African American smokers attempting to quit.",Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers,9390493,R01MD010362,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' indexing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Poverty ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Volition ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Letters ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' interest ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' demographics ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' public health relevance ', ' mindfulness ', ' distress tolerance ', ' social health determinants ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' built environment ', ' BD2K ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' data to knowledge ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable device ', ' smoking abstinence ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2018,740378,0.2244692431251016
"Precision message approaches to combating late stage COPD diagnosis among rural adults Project Summary/Abstract Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death and fourth leading cause of disability in the United States (US). Nearly 12 million adults live with its progressively worsening symptoms but have yet to be diagnosed. Significant disparities in late stage diagnosis exist in rural patient populations, specifically those in the southeastern region of the US where tobacco use is highest. Alleviating the burden of late stage COPD diagnosis through smoking cessation and screening is a national priority, as outlined in the 2017 National COPD Action Plan. Health communication campaigns have been effective in promoting both smoking cessation and health screening behaviors in the general US population, but their efficacy in rural regions of the nation is unknown. Moreover, these campaigns rarely bring attention to the mild symptoms of tobacco-associated diseases and the benefits of early detection. Culturally adapting messages to the unique needs and preferences of rural adults at-risk for COPD and experiencing its mild symptoms has important implications for enhancing proactive health behaviors against poor outcomes associated with its late stage diagnosis. The purpose of this NRSA F32 Fellowship proposal is to receive mentored training that will allow me to identify and test the combination of message attributes that are most likely to promote smoking cessation and screening behaviors among subgroups of rural adults at-risk for COPD in a southeastern region of the US. In Specific Aim 1, I will conduct a sequential exploratory mixed-method (qual-quant) to explore the psychosocial attributes of smoking cessation and COPD screenings. In Specific Aim 2, I will design and conduct an intervention to test how preferences for message attributes related to smoking cessation and screening behaviors vary among rural adults at-risk for COPD, by gender and race. Throughout this NRSA F32 Fellowship, I will receive structured and intensive didactic, experiential, and professional development training from a transdisciplinary panel of experts in targeted health message design interventions, tobacco control research, experimental design methodology, and rural health disparities in smoking cessation and health screening behaviors. My long-term career goal is to become a leading mixed-methods transdisciplinary researcher with expertise in developing, implementing, and evaluating strategic health messages to support proactive tobacco-associated lung disease behaviors among medically underserved populations. This NRSA F32 Fellowship training experience will allow me to conduct a mentored and applied transdisciplinary research study that advances my potential as an independent researcher. The mentored research study will also address a national priority to improve the lives of all those affected by COPD, specifically by examining factors that contribute to late stage COPD diagnosis in vulnerable populations. Project Narrative Rural adults report high rates of tobacco use and delayed diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), increasing the risk of poor health outcomes. Culturally adapting health communication messages to the preferences of rural adults at-risk for and experiencing mild COPD symptoms has important implications for alleviating the prevalence of late stage diagnosis.

"The Impact of Tobacco Control Policies on Health Equity in the United States Project Summary Abstract Since the mid-1900s, tobacco control policies have effectively decreased smoking prevalence in the United States. However, important disparities by socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity in smoking prevalence and tobacco-related health outcomes persist. People with relatively lower education and income are more likely to smoke than their more affluent counterparts. In addition, although non-Hispanic Blacks and non-Hispanic Whites have a similar prevalence of smoking, Blacks have lower quit rates and higher lung cancer incidence and mortality than Whites. Hispanics, on the other hand, smoke less than Blacks or Whites. This suggests that current tobacco control policies do not adequately reduce, let alone eliminate, smoking disparities in vulnerable subgroups. However, few policy evaluations address smoking disparities, and the effects of policies across different SES and racial/ethnic subgroups are mostly unknown. Moreover, tobacco control policies are generally designed with broad populations in mind, without a focus on reducing the prevalence of smoking among specific populations. As a consequence, some policies may actually be exacerbating smoking disparities, even if their net population effect is positive. The objective of this study is to determine the health equity impact of established and emerging tobacco control policies in the US. The proposed project will: (1) determine how tobacco control policies influence disparities in smoking initiation among youth; (2) determine how tobacco control policies influence disparities in smoking cessation among adults; and (3) predict which combination of policies are needed to reduce health disparities in tobacco- attributable mortality over time using a tobacco policy simulation model. Aims 1 and 2 will systematically analyze two large, nationally-representative surveys over time to determine the extent to which tobacco control policies in the US affect disparities for smoking initiation and cessation, focusing on the differential impact of policies by education, income, and race/ethnicity (i.e., Whites, Blacks, Hispanics), and their possible intersection with gender. Aim 3 will integrate the evidence developed in Aims 1 and 2 into a simulation model to predict how policies, individually and in combination, will affect smoking disparities and future downstream tobacco-attributable deaths. The proposed study will take the field beyond describing smoking disparities to producing concrete, actionable evidence informing which tobacco control policies may be most effective in simultaneously reducing both overall smoking and tobacco-related health disparities. Knowledge gained from this study will guide policy-makers’ decisions regarding implementation of specific tobacco control policies by highlighting the importance of considering their contribution to tobacco-related health disparities. Project Narrative The proposed study will examine how tobacco control policies in the US affect disparities by socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity in smoking initiation and cessation. Findings from this research will provide critical evidence to policy makers and public health professionals at the local, state, and national levels as they consider the implications of tobacco control policy choices on tobacco-related health disparities.",The Impact of Tobacco Control Policies on Health Equity in the United States,9443026,R37CA214787,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Canada ', ' Data Sources ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Investments ', ' Laws ', ' Mass Media ', ' mass information media ', ' mortality ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Sales ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Taxation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Workplace ', ' population survey ', ' Label ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' named group ', ' Special Population ', ' success ', ' Media Campaign ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' movie ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Tobacco Control Research ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' attributable death ', ' attributable mortality ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' prospective ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' comparative ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' health equity ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R37,2018,568400,0.27332454784652616
"Biomarker of Lung Disease in African Americans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the 3rd leading cause of death in the US1,2. Although COPD occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develops chronic airflow limitation or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). Identification molecular profiles from current or former smokers who are likely to progress is a crucial step in understanding the pathogenesis of COPD and emphysema. There are very few publications that describe COPD biomarkers in large, well phenotyped cohorts that include a significant number of African Americans. This study will leverage large NIH- supported cohorts (COPDGene, SPIROMICS, and MESA-Lung) that have large number of well-characterized African Americans subjects with or at risk for COPD. Since the subjects have stored plasma and have been followed for 7-10 years with extensive clinical, physiologic, and imaging, we can very cost-effectively apply a proteomic approach. Furthermore, because the cohorts have other valuable Omics data, we can integrate the proteomic findings with whole genome sequencing and other advanced molecular studies such as genomics. This knowledge may help develop novel diagnostic tests and therapies for early prevention and treatment of COPD and will identify any markers that are specific to smoking-related lung disease in African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third most common cause of death in the United States. The major risk factor is smoking; however, most smokers do not develop COPD and the factors that identify who goes from normal to abnormal lung function are unknown. Most of the studies on COPD have been in non-Hispanic Whites and Asians and there are very few studies, which address risk factors and molecular pathogenesis in African Americans. This proposal will use three existing NHLBI cohorts to identify blood signatures that can identify who will be at risk for developing smoking related lung disease in African Americans.

"Assessing Smoking Dependence Among Spanish-speaking Latino Smokers Project Summary/Abstract  While prominent theories of addiction implicate physical dependence as a key predictor of drug use and relapse, the limited available research among Latinos has generally found that physical dependence has limited utility for predicting cessation. Further, Spanish-language instruments for measuring dependence multidimensionally have demonstrated poor psychometric structure among Spanish-speaking Latino smokers. These studies suggest that the mere translation of existing measures may not be adequate for developing effective assessments of tobacco dependence for Spanish-speaking smokers. Rather, there is critical need for an in-depth examination of the appropriateness of dependence scale translations and the relevance of item content for Spanish-speaking Latino smokers. As such, the aim of the current study is to use a mixed-methods approach to develop a theoretically grounded, multidimensional measure of smoking dependence and motives for smoking based on established measures but that is appropriate, reliable, and valid for Spanish-speaking smokers. We propose a four-phase study. Phase 1 will consist of cognitive testing of Spanish translations of the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM) and Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale (NDSS) items to identify potential problems with the items as currently translated. Phase 2 will consist of in-depth interviews of the lived experience of dependence among Spanish-speaking smokers of Mexican origin to inform item refinement and development of additional items. Phase 3 will consist of item refinement and development informed by data gathered in Phases 1 and 2. Phase 4 will consist of validation of the resulting refined Brief WISDM and NDSS scales, as well as an examination of the entire pool of resulting items for potential development of a different and possibly more appropriate measure. Such a project stands to significantly impact research among Latinos across the tobacco continuum by allowing for more valid assessments of dependence among Latinos, which could lead to novel culturally relevant knowledge of the processes involved in smoking initiation, maintenance, cessation and relapse. Project Narrative/Public Health Impact The smoking pattern of Latino smokers differs notably from that of non-Latino White smokers in a manner that suggests physical dependence may not be a strong motivator of tobacco use and smoking relapse among Latino smokers. Multidimensional measures of dependence may be more useful, but research on dependence among Spanish-speaking smokers is hampered by a lack of psychometrically sound Spanish-language measures of dependence. Development of valid, multidimensional assessments of dependence among Spanish-speaking Mexican-origin smokers, who represent the largest proportion of Latino smokers, would allow for the conduct of research that could lead to novel, culturally relevant knowledge of the processes involved in smoking initiation, maintenance, cessation and relapse. It stands to improve interventions tailored to or targeted at Latino smokers by informing more culturally appropriate assessment of nicotine dependence. Advancing knowledge in these areas would help to identify treatment targets, improve current smoking cessation interventions, and ultimately aid in eliminating tobacco-related health disparities among Latinos.",Assessing Smoking Dependence Among Spanish-speaking Latino Smokers,9544304,R21MD011431,"['Drug Modelings ', ' Interview ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Nicotine ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' sound ', ' Syndrome ', ' Tobacco ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' tobacco dependent ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Mexican ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Physical Dependence ', ' Smoker ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' Tobacco smoking behavior ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' experience ', ' Proxy ', ' Cigarette ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cessation Research ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' drug relapse ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' smoking relapse ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' smoking dependent ', ' smoking dependence ', ' smoke addiction ', ' smoking addiction ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2018,188416,0.14549790157878856
"Econometric Analysis of Cigarette Purchases on Native American Reservations PROJECT SUMMARY Cigarette taxation is a widely used tobacco control policy that can improve public health by discouraging smoking. Due to their legal status, Native American reservations (NARs) and First Nations reserves are important sources of lower- or un-taxed cigarettes in the U.S. and Canada. In some geographic areas and times, the prevalence of NAR purchases reaches over 40%. Data from the 2010-11 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Survey implies that 5.6 million smokers live in 7 states where the prevalence of NAR purchases is between 15% and 35%. The policy trend towards higher cigarette taxes means that tax avoidance through NARs is likely to grow substantially. The 2014 Surgeon General's Report, the CDC (2015), and the National Research Council Institute of Medicine (2015) stress the public health significance of, and need for additional research into, contraband cigarette markets including NARs. The project's broad goal is to study the impact of NAR cigarette availability on smoking, birth outcomes, and health disparities. Aim 1 is to conduct a quasi-experimental analysis of the impact of the availability of NAR cigarettes on adult smoking participation. We will analyze individual-level data on smoking from multiple large U.S. and Canada secondary data sets. Our econometric specification will test 4 hypotheses: 1) that state cigarette excise taxes reduce adult smoking; 2) that the impact of taxes on smoking varies depending upon the availability of NAR cigarettes; 3) that the availability of NAR cigarettes has a causal treatment effect to increase smoking; and 4) that the impacts of taxes and NAR cigarette availability on adult smoking varies with socioeconomic status. Aim 2 is to conduct a quasi-experimental analysis of the impact of the availability of NAR cigarettes on youth smoking participation, cigarettes smoked per day, and smoking initiation. We will test the 4 hypotheses listed under Aim 1 in the context of youth smoking. Aim 3 is to conduct a quasi-experimental analysis of the impact of the availability of NAR cigarettes on health outcomes and health disparities. We will test the 4 hypotheses listed under Aim 1 in the context of health outcomes. Aim 4 is to conduct a quasi-experimental analysis of the indirect effects of the availability of reservation cigarettes on the prices charged by off-reservation cigarette retailers. Our econometric analysis will test whether cigarette sales on nearby NARs is associated with lower cigarette prices and sales off-reservation. Aim 5 is to conduct a more structural econometric analysis of the impact of the availability of NAR cigarettes on individuals' joint decisions about smoking, purchase location, and cigarette price paid. We will estimate a structural endogenous switching regression model. The estimated model will directly estimate key mechanisms or links in the chain of causality: the impact of taxes and distance on the probability of NAR purchases; and the impact of NAR purchases on cigarette prices paid. X Cigarette taxation is a widely used tobacco control policy that can improve public health by discouraging smoking. Due to their special legal status, Native American reservations are an important source of un-taxed cigarettes. Beyond the significance for public health in general, this source of un-taxed cigarettes is especially significant for health disparities.

"Adoption, diffusion, and implementation of Tobacco 21 policies to address health disparities ABSTRACT Raising the minimum age of legal access (MLA) to tobacco products to 21 decreases access and would likely prevent or delay initiation of tobacco use by adolescents and young adults. However, modern tobacco behavior use among young people is increasingly complex and is characterized by decreased cigarette use, increased use of non-cigarette tobacco product use and, poly tobacco use. In addition, tobacco use patterns and tobacco sales to minors vary based on race/ethnicity. While there has been recent and rapid diffusion of Tobacco 21 policies, little data exist on the process, content, or outcomes of Tobacco 21 laws. The existing evidence for increasing the MLA to 21 holds promise to further reduce tobacco use among young people but the extent to which such policies will be effective for all tobacco products as well as all racial/ethnic groups is largely unknown. Using the Multiple Streams Framework and the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework as our conceptual frames we operationalize and assess health policy factors that impact Tobacco 21 Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance. This project uses a mixed methods approach to understand the implementation and impact of policies that raise the MLA to 21, seeking to expand the evidence base with a focus on racial/ethnic groups in the context of a diverse tobacco environment. Specifically, we will: (1) carry out a comparative case study of 15 states using document analysis of Tobacco 21 bills, news media content analysis, and key informant interviews to identify factors that may contribute to the adoption or rejection of Tobacco 21 legislation; (2) conduct a repeated cross sectional tobacco product purchase study to examine implementation of a statewide Tobacco 21 law in New Jersey; and, (3) describe the impact of Tobacco 21 laws by modeling tobacco use behavior among 13 to 25 year olds in states with and without Tobacco 21 laws using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. The relevance of the proposed research to public health is its ability to improve existing and future Tobacco 21 policies and reduce tobacco use disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this research project is to better understand the implementation and impact of policies to raise the legal age of tobacco sales to 21, with a focus on racial/ethnic groups in the context of a diverse tobacco environment. The relevance of the proposed research to public health is its ability to improve existing and future Tobacco 21 policies and reduce tobacco use disparities.","Adoption, diffusion, and implementation of Tobacco 21 policies to address health disparities",9590308,R01CA231139,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Cities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Laws ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' Modernization ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Local Government ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New Jersey ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Sales ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' State Government ', ' Provincial Government ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Smokeless Tobacco ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' news ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' tobacco company ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Stream ', ' Pattern ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' success ', ' Cigarette ', ' Cigar ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' informant ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' comparative ', ' evidence base ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' ecigarette ', ' ecig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' poly-tobacco use ', ' polytobacco use ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCI,RBHS-SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2018,639671,0.14715888197179075
"Using mobile technology to understand the impact of socioeconomic and neighborhood factors on smoking cessation PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, including accounting for 30% of all cancers and approximately 90% of lung cancer. Additionally, recent estimates place the annual economic burden of smoking at $96 billion in medical costs with an additional $97 billion in lost worker productivity. The majority of individuals who smoke indicate they want to quit, and although half of all smokers make a quit attempt every year, only 6% successfully do so. Poverty, lower education, unemployment, uninsurance, and other factors related to low socioeconomic status (SES) are potent predictors of greater difficulty quitting smoking and SES-related tobacco disparities have widened over the last several decades. Neighborhood-level factors such as poverty, social trust, and density of tobacco outlets, while clearly linked to individual-level SES, present unique factors that are disadvantageous for smoking cessation. Furthermore, health behavior models posit that low SES and disadvantageous neighborhood factors can impact intrapersonal experiences (e.g. negative affect, low motivation to quit, low self-efficacy, high stress) and social experiences (e.g. greater cigarette availability, more time spent with smokers or in places that allow smoking) that, in turn, increase risk for smoking lapse during a quit attempt. Advanced research approaches using mobile health technology (“mHealth”) offer an exciting path to gathering real-time, real-world measures on the dynamics of intrapersonal and social experiences during a quit attempt. These data can help elucidate how SES and neighborhoods connect to smoking cessation through intrapersonal and social experiences.  This project hypothesizes that 1) SES and neighborhood environments are connected to smoking lapse/abstinence during a quit attempt; 2) the dynamic features of intrapersonal and social experiences (e.g. mean levels, trajectories over time, stability/volatility) are connected to smoking lapse/abstinence during a quit attempt; and 3) the associations of SES and neighborhoods with smoking lapse/abstinence are in part mediated by the dynamic features of intrapersonal and social experiences during a quit attempt. Increased knowledge regarding the dynamic features of intrapersonal and social experiences that inhibit individuals from successfully staying quit is key to eliminating smoking-related disease and disability. A deeper understanding of the extent to which the dynamics of intrapersonal and social experiences operate as mechanisms connecting SES and neighborhood environments to smoking cessation will provide a wealth of new information that can be used to help low SES populations successfully stay quit and drive programs and policies to encourage smoking cessation. Findings from this project will be critical in continuing to propel the scientific study of health disparities, smoking cessation, and the prevention of cancer and other chronic diseases; and, ultimately, can help improve the health and well-being of underserved populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project will provide novel information on associations between socioeconomic status (SES), neighborhood environments, intrapersonal lived and social experiences, and smoking cessation. Using mHealth technology to examine of how SES and neighborhoods operate through lived experiences (e.g. affect, stress, craving, motivation, cigarette availability, and contact with other smokers) during a quit attempt will provide a wealth of new information for smoking cessation programs. Moreover, the results of this project will be key in propelling efforts to address tobacco-related health disparities.",Using mobile technology to understand the impact of socioeconomic and neighborhood factors on smoking cessation,9611052,F32CA232796,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Poverty ', ' Productivity ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Mediating ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Policies ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Health Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Smoking Status ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' restricting smoking ', ' smoking restriction ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Population ', ' Abstinence ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile computing ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F32,2018,58282,0.21209603537535324
"Geographic variation in the diverse tobacco retail environment and its impact on tobacco use disparities ABSTRACT Amid declining cigarette consumption, sales of non-cigarette tobacco products remain strong. Importantly, the diverse products available in the current tobacco marketplace pose different levels of harm to the user. Combustible products such as cigarettes and cigars are higher on the tobacco risk continuum than non- combustible products such as smokeless tobacco and electronic cigarettes (e-cigs). Conceivably, smokers who switch to a non-combustible product may reduce their risk of smoking-related disease. This behavior, however, is significantly more common among whites compared to blacks, who have the highest rates of combustible tobacco use of any racial or ethnic group. Indeed, cigarette smoking rates are declining faster among whites than blacks, potentially driven by e-cig uptake. Differential rates of quitting smoking by switching to e-cigs or other non-combustible products may exacerbate existing health disparities between whites and blacks. Although tobacco use is influenced by several individual, interpersonal, and societal factors, the retail environment is known to play a critical role in shaping smoking behaviors, particularly among racial minorities, whom the tobacco industry has historically exploited. Despite the growing popularity of e-cigs and other non- cigarette tobacco products, little is known about the promotion of these products at the point-of-sale. This project will examine how the retail of diverse tobacco products varies across the U.S. and the extent to which it is associated with use behaviors of community residents. Specifically, this study will 1) investigate the relationship between regional tobacco product sales, tobacco control policies, and community demographics using Nielsen market scanner data and census data, 2) document the association between the local tobacco retail environment and tobacco product use using geocoded data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and store audits, and 3) model smoking-related disparities attributed to changes in tobacco use behaviors using repeated cross-sectional NHIS data and longitudinal data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study. PROJECT NARRATIVE The current tobacco marketplace in the United States is more diverse than ever, with consumption of cigars, smokeless tobacco, and electronic cigarettes remaining strong amid declining cigarette consumption.

"Menthol Tobacco Sales Restrictions and Smoking Disparities Project Summary and Abstract The plummeting prevalence of cigarette smoking in the US in the last decade is a profound and ongoing public health accomplishment. This has been largely driven by policies, such as taxation, which effectively make tobacco more costly or otherwise difficult to obtain. However, while consumption of non-menthol cigarettes has declined, menthol cigarette use has actually increased in recent years, suggesting that these policies may have had a lesser impact on groups that overwhelmingly favor menthol cigarettes, such as African American smokers. African Americans bear a highly disproportionate burden from various smoking-related conditions including heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer when compared to other racial/ethnic groups in the US. Given the central role that menthol cigarettes play in causing tobacco-related disease disparities, and acknowledging that policy has been the critical lever for reducing smoking prevalence in the general population, there is an urgent need to better understand how emerging policy opportunities might influence cigarette consumption among African Americans. In recent years, policies that would fully or partially remove menthol-flavored tobacco from the market have been considered at both the local and federal level, however it is unclear what kind of real-world impact a menthol tobacco sales restriction might have on tobacco use prevalence and disparities. The objective of this application is to determine how a city-wide restriction on the sale of menthol tobacco products impacts smoking among African American adults living in the metropolitan area. Presently there is a unique opportunity to evaluate a city-initiated menthol tobacco sales restriction policy. Starting on August 1, 2018, a menthol tobacco sales restriction goes into effect in Minneapolis, MN. We propose an innovative case-cohort study design, utilizing online recruitment and surveying, to measure this policy's impact on African American's smoking. One year after the policy goes into effect, we will recruit, from the population of Twin Cities, MN metropolitan area African Americans, “cases” who have smoked in the previous two years but not recently, as well as “controls” who are current smokers. The main exposures of interest will be geographic (i.e. residing within vs. outside of Minneapolis, distance to city border, etc.) We will accomplish the proposal's objective through these specific aims: 1) Determine how a policy banning menthol-flavored tobacco relates to cigarette consumption among African American smokers in the Twin Cities, MN metropolitan region. 2) Identify how the impact of a policy banning menthol flavored tobacco within Minneapolis may be modified by factors related to geography and individuals' life patterns. It is anticipated that these aims will yield the following expected outcomes. First, they will illuminate the effects of a menthol-ban policy on African American adults' smoking. Second, they will provide direction for how such a policy could be optimized to prevent disease and reduce disparities. These aims are expected to have positive impact because an evidence basis is critical for implementing prudent tobacco control policies. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to the public's health because it will provide evidence for whether policies that restrict the sale of cigarettes with menthol flavoring impact tobacco use among African American adults. The discovery of policy options that promote tobacco-free lifestyles, reduce chronic disease risk, and thus enhance health in populations that bear a disproportionate burden of disease is relevant to the NIH's mission.",Menthol Tobacco Sales Restrictions and Smoking Disparities,9581342,R21CA229297,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cities ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Evaluation Methodology ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Marketing ', ' Menthol ', ' Minnesota ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sales ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Taxation ', ' Tobacco ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' distilled alcoholic beverage ', ' liquor ', ' Smoker ', ' non-smoker ', ' nonsmoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' tobacco company ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Flavoring ', ' Flavoring Agents ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' interest ', ' metropolitan ', ' Municipalities ', ' Cigarette ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Portraits ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Smoking History ', ' Output ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' recruit ', ' tobacco-free ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2018,200970,0.2134351719642851
"A guided imagery tobacco cessation intervention delivered by a quitline and website ABSTRACT  Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of death accounting for more than 480,000 deaths each year, and 16 million Americans suffer from one or more diseases caused by smoking. Cessation of tobacco use can significantly reduce the risk of disease. Telephone quitlines are an effective and highly scalable way to help individuals quit smoking. However quitlines are an underutilized resource, and do not reach certain segments of the population, including males and racial/ethnic minorities. Guided imagery is a form of mind-body therapy that involves controlled visualization of specific mental images, and shares similarities with mindfulness meditation. Multiple studies have shown that exposure to mindfulness and imagery training results in significantly increased smoking abstinence rates. Also, imagery is used by a significant number of racially diverse male and female athletes. Although imagery is an effective tool for smoking  cessation, the mode of delivery has generally been in person, limiting the dissemination to large populations. We hypothesize that guided mental imagery delivered using the uitline “coaching model” combined with an interactive website could be an effective and disseminable intervention strategy. In addition, this model may be more readily accepted by underrepresented smokers, and may increase the reach and effectiveness of telephone quitlines. Therefore, the objective of this three year R34 application is to develop and test the feasibility of a theory-driven, telephone plus web-based, guided mental imagery intervention for smoking cessation. We will develop the intervention and attention-control condition, study procedures, training protocols, and competency testing models with input from quitline personnel, and focus and user groups of smokers in preparation for a randomized clinical trial. We will conduct a feasibility trial (N=100) to gather preliminary data on recruitment, retention, and preliminary estimates of the potential effects of the guided mental imagery intervention on quitline callers’ tobacco use, cravings, and self-efficacy to quit smoking. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the Imagery Intervention or a matched control condition delivered by project imagery coaches. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6-weeks and 6-months post-enrollment. Primary outcomes will be self-reported point prevalence and prolonged abstinence of tobacco use. A subsample of 20 quitters will be tested for salivary cotinine as biochemical validation of self-report in this population.  Secondary outcomes will be self-reported cravings and self-efficacy. A manual of procedures will be developed to prepare us to conduct a future randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of the imagery intervention. The proposed project has the potential to advance the science of tobacco cessation through the addition of guided mental imagery, and improve public health through increased reach of telephone quitlines. It is innovative in that it uses guided imagery to address theory-driven targets of self-efficacy for abstinence and cravings. If successful, this model could be expanded to address other health behaviors such as diet, physical activity and other substance use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tobacco use is still the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States. Tobacco quitlines are effective at helping smokers to quit, but they are underutilized, especially by men and racial/ethnic minorities. Guided imagery is effective at helping people quit smoking, and is appealing to males and diverse racial groups, but has limited reach. The proposed study will develop and test the feasibility and acceptability of a guided imagery tobacco cessation intervention that is delivered by a combination of quitline coaches and an interactive website.",A guided imagery tobacco cessation intervention delivered by a quitline and website,9546507,R34AT008947,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Cotinine ', ' Scotine ', ' Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Persons ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Population Control ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Sports ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Woman ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Bupropion ', ' buproprion ', ' Wellbutrin ', ' Amfebutamone ', ' Competence ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Guided imagery ', ' Psychotherapeutic Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Biochemical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' satisfaction ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Salivary ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' high school ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Mind-Body Intervention ', ' mind body wellness ', ' mind body treatments ', ' mind body therapy ', ' mind body techniques ', ' mind body medicine skills ', ' mind body approach ', ' Mind-Body Medicine ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Validity of Self Report ', ' Preparation ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' tobacco abstinence ', ' tobacco control ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' mental imagery ', ' usability ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' mindfulness ', ' mindfulness meditation ', ' attentional control ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' electronic nicotine delivery device ', ' Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems ', ' recruit ', ' Cost efficiency ', ' tobacco user ', ' tobacco cessation treatment ', ' tobacco cessation intervention ', ' cigarette smoke ', ' smoking abstinence ', ' feasibility trial ', ' ']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R34,2018,191504,0.2423780967475508
"Telephone-Delivered Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Smoking Cessation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Smoking cessation telephone quit lines (QLs), available in all 50 states; now serve over 500,000 smokers each year. On average, only 14% (range: 8% to 20%) of QL callers stop smoking by the 12 month follow-up even with the aid of traditional Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) combined with pharmacotherapy (typically nicotine replacement therapy; NRT). The low quit rates of QLs stifle their great potential public health impact. To address the low quit rate problem, and thereby start a new research paradigm focused on innovative QL behavioral intervention content, we propose to test a novel counseling approach, called Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), as a telephone-delivered quit smoking intervention. We recently completed a small (N = 121) NIDA R21 pilot randomized QL trial of proactively-delivered ACT vs. CBT in state QL callers that was underpowered due to R21 budget limits. Results showed that ACT: (1) was feasible to implement and evaluate in a state QL context, (2) had higher participant engagement and satisfaction than CBT, (3) had higher levels of acceptance of cravings than CBT, which in turn predicted quitting smoking, and (4) had higher (albeit non-significant) 6-month post randomization quit rates than CBT. Building on these promising and non- definitive results, a comparative effectiveness randomized trial with a large and fully-powered sample size (N = 1168) and longer term follow-up (i.e., 12 months) is now needed to definitively determine whether telephone- delivered ACT: (1) provides higher quit rates than CBT, (2) operates according to its theory-based mechanisms, and (3) is more cost-effective than CBT. Accordingly, we propose to conduct a randomized comparative effectiveness trial of telephone-delivered ACT counseling plus NRT (n=584) versus telephone-delivered traditional CBT counseling plus NRT (n=584) in state quit line callers, in order to demonstrate that telephone-delivered ACT: (1) has significantly higher 30-day point prevalence abstinence at 12 months post-randomization than telephone-delivered traditional CBT; (2) has smoking cessation outcomes significantly mediated by three psychological processes central to the theoretical model underlying ACT: acceptance of internal (a) sensations, (b) emotions, and (c) thoughts that cue smoking; (3) Will be significantly more cost-effective than telephone-delivered CBT, as measured by cost per additional quitter, incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER), and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The study, well-motivated by preliminary results, shows exciting promise for improving the success rates of quit lines and thereby lowering healthcare costs and reducing premature tobacco-related deaths. If shown to be efficacious and cost-effective, ACT would provide the scientific field a new conceptual model of QL intervention and quit lines a new treatment approach that could help 45,000 more (of the 500,000) quit line callers to stop smoking each year, thereby saving in medical costs and prolonging lives.

"Ovarian Hormones Effect on Smoking Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco smoking is a leading cause of preventable death and disability in the U.S. Although women compared to men are at a greater risk of smoking-related disease morbidity and mortality, research suggests they may smoke for different reasons than men and have a harder time quitting than men. Research identifying female-specific factors underlying addiction is critical for: (a) addressing sex-related health disparities; (b) informing female-specific treatments; and (c) discovering addiction processes that are overrepresented among females yet applicable to both sexes. Ovarian hormones represent a female specific factor implicate in the maintenance of nicotine addiction and success following a quit attempt. This proposal aims to advance this line of research by combining ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with daily hormonal sampling across an entire menstrual cycle to further examine the patterns and mechanisms of ovarian hormone variation effects on smoking in women in real time. The use of prospective daily recordings and hormonal sampling will allow us to test whether smoking will be higher on days with high estrogen and lower on days with high progesterone (Aim 1), that women with greater estrogen to progesterone ratios compared to women with lower estrogen to progesterone ratios across the entire menstrual cycle will smoke more and be more nicotine dependent (Aim 2), and that days with higher estrogen will be marked by greater nicotine reward and worse cognitive control, which will mediate relations between higher estrogen and increased smoking (Aim 3). Secondary aims will explore variability of hormonal effects across the menstrual cycle (Aim 4). As the first comprehensive study investigating daily changes in ovarian hormones, drug reward, cognitive control, and smoking behavior, this project will pave the way for a program of research involving more intensive laboratory and field-based studies of psychoneuroendocrinological underpinnings of smoking in women.  Through expert mentoring, directed readings, formal coursework and seminars, onsite training, attending national scientific meetings, manuscript and grant preparation, mentorship of students in the USC Health, Emotion, and Addiction Laboratory, and the completion of the proposed investigation expertise will be gained in: (a) Naturalistic field assessment of nicotine addiction; (b) EMA design and implementation; and (c) Use of advanced statistical methodology to test the aims outlined by the project. Thus, by the end of the proposed training period, the applicant will be uniquely positioned to run an independent interdisciplinary line of research incorporating both lab and field based studies in investigating female specific factors in addiction. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clarifying the role of ovarian hormones on smoking may aid cessation treatment in women and could provide further evidence for the use of hormone-based medications for smoking cessation in both sexes.

"Applying mHealth to Tobacco-related Health Disparities: Enhancing aspects of Resiliency to aid Cessation Efforts ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and is the leading cause of lung cancer. The majority of individuals who smoke indicate they want to quit, and although half of all smokers make a quit attempt every year, only 6% successfully do so. Lower education levels, poverty, and unemployment are potent predictors of greater difficulty quitting smoking. Additionally, SES-related tobacco disparities have increased over the last several decades. Increased knowledge regarding those factors that allow individuals to be successful in staying quit is key to eliminatig smoking-related cancers and illnesses in these populations. One promising factor related to increased cessation success is mindfulness, which is the ability to attend to the present moment with purpose (e.g., not on autopilot) and without labeling thoughts/emotions/sensations as good or bad (e.g., an attitude of nonjudgment). Mindfulness is associated with increased cessation success and with key mechanisms influencing cessation such as affect and self-regulatory capacity. However, there is a distinct lack of data on real-time, real-world measures of smoking, the underlying mechanisms associated with abstinence (particularly those that may be unique among low SES populations), and how mindfulness impacts those potential mechanisms. The objective of this application is to utilize real-time, real-world measurement approaches (i.e., ecological momentary assessment [EMA] and AutoSense) to examine the impact of mindfulness on key mechanisms underlying smoking cessation among low SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers. Christine Vinci, Ph.D. is a postdoctoral fellow at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and is seeking 5 years of support through the K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award through the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, in order to examine the role of mindfulness on key mechanisms implicated in cessation among low SES, diverse populations. This proposal directly addresses the mission of NIMHD to ""lead scientific research to improve minority health and eliminate health disparities."" Dr. Vinci's research broadly focuses on cognitive and affective mechanisms (e.g., affect regulation, expectancies, self- efficacy) implicated in the development, maintenance, and treatment of substance use disorders. More specifically, her work aims to understand the mechanisms underlying smoking and alcohol use among underserved populations, with a specific focus on mindfulness. A better understanding of the effects of mindfulness on smoking and problematic drinking, and the mechanisms through which mindfulness-based interventions impact these disorders could help in the development of new and more effective interventions. For this award, the primary research aims are twofold. First, the examination of trait and state mindfulness on momentary mechanisms gathered via advanced technology (EMA and AutoSense) among low SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers will be conducted via secondary data analysis of existing datasets of Dr. Vinci's primary mentor, Dr. David Wetter. Second, the feasibility of providing mindfulness strategies in real-time to low SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers attempting to quit smoking, based on objective data collected via AutoSense technology, will be examined. The first aim will take place during the K99 phase of the award, where Dr. Vinci will be provided with guidance by expert mentors in their respective fields. The training and guidance received during the K99 phase will directly inform the implementation of the second aim, which will take place during the R00 phase of the award. This project is highly innovative because 1) to date, no studies have examined these constructs via real-world, real-time data among low SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers through combined approaches such as EMA and AutoSense, and 2) findings can directly inform treatment development to specify how mindfulness impacts underlying mechanisms, leading to the reduction of tobacco- related health disparities. Dr. Vinci's training goals include learning how to design and implement research protocols that utilize advanced technology to collect participant data (EMA and AutoSense), how to conduct advanced statistical analyses on multi-level, longitudinal data, and how to combine knowledge and strategies from diverse areas of research (i.e., models linking social determinants and SES to health outcomes, tobacco use and dependence, resiliency and mindfulness, self-regulation) to create intervention approaches to reduce health disparities. Both the training received through this award and the preliminary data Dr. Vinci will collect and analyze, will aid her in the transition to an independent clinical researcher, where she will examine relevant mechanisms via mobile technology and implement mindfulness-based strategies to reduce problematic health behaviors and improve quality of life among diverse populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cigarette smoking is one of the leading causes of preventable death in the US, the primary cause of lung cancer, and is one of the leading causes of health disparities. Assisting individuals in staying quit is vital to eliminating smoking-related cancers, particularly among low SES, racial/ethnic populations, as these groups are most impacted by cancer-related health disparities. This research will build upon and expand what we know about smoking relapse and can potentially contribute to enhancing smoking cessation treatments, specifically targeting the prevention of relapse once an individual successfully quits smoking.",Applying mHealth to Tobacco-related Health Disparities: Enhancing aspects of Resiliency to aid Cessation Efforts,9431063,R00MD010468,"['Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Emotions ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Randomized Trial of an Innovative Smartphone Intervention for Smoking Cessation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is tremendous need for smoking cessation intervention technologies with strong potential population-level impact at the lowest possible cost. That potential can be found in the newest technological innovation in quit smoking interventions: smartphone-based smoking cessation software applications (""apps""). There are over 400 smoking cessation apps, which were downloaded in the United States 3.2 million times during the two-year period 2012 to 2013. No trials of any app's effectiveness for general adult cessation have been published and no NIH-funded cessation intervention trials are in progress-despite the fact this is a high priority NIH funding topic. The enormous usage of smoking cessation apps contrasted with their unknown effectiveness creates a serious scientific gap that could stifle their population-level impact.  Research on US Clinical Practice Guidelines (USCPG) apps begins to address that research gap. But only following the USCPG has had limitations in other modalities of delivery. An approach, called Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), addresses these limitations with both innovative intervention content and highly promising results from six published trials. ACT's innovation is its dual focus on increasing willingness to experience physical cravings, emotions, and thoughts that cue smoking while making values-guided committed behavior changes. We recently developed the first ACT app for smoking cessation, called ""SmartQuit,"" and tested it in a pilot randomized controlled trial (N  196), comparing it with an app that follows USCPG (National Cancer Institute's ""QuitGuide""). Results showed that SmartQuit had: (1) higher participant engagement and satisfaction than QuitGuide, (3) higher levels of acceptance of cravings than QuitGuide, and (3) descriptively higher quit rates (albeit non-significant) than QuitGuide at the two-month follow-up.  Building on these promising results, we propose a fully-powered three-arm randomized controlled trial (n = 811 per arm) that compares SmartQuit to QuitGuide and each app to the NCI's Clearing the Air booklet, which follows the USCPG, to definitively determine whether (1) an USCPG app is more efficacious than a USCPG self-help booklet; (2) an ACT app is more efficacious than a USCPG booklet; (3) an ACT app is more efficacious than a USCPG app.  As millions of people are choosing smartphone apps to help them quit smoking, this innovative study shows exciting promise for improving the success rates of quit smoking apps and thereby lowering healthcare costs and reducing premature tobacco-related deaths. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over the two-year period of 2012-2013, smartphone applications for smoking cessation reached 3.2 million people in the United States and their reach is climbing rapidly. This randomized trial will definitively test a smartphone application-delivered Acceptance & Commitment Therapy intervention for adult smoking cessation.

"Exposure to flavored tobacco advertising and associations with future use in young adults: implications for health equity PROJECT SUMMARY A potential ban on flavored tobacco products is a policy option to reduce tobacco product initiation by youth and young adults. However, few studies examine its potential to reduce disparities in vulnerable populations due to tobacco advertising exposure, perceptions of flavored products, and differential use. The purpose of this study is to address how targeted marketing of FTPs may influence perceptions of, susceptibility to and initiation of tobacco in a vulnerable population (recruited from 3 wards within Washington, DC with the highest smoking rates, % African American, and lowest SES) (VP) vs. a non-vulnerable population (non-VP) of young adults in Washington, DC. It will address the potential of a policy ban or restrictions on flavored tobacco products to reduce tobacco and, ultimately, cancer disparities and enhance equity in the distribution of tobacco marketing risk. The current study will build on the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), a model of cognitive processing of how advertising results in persuasion. The ELM suggests that one way tobacco advertising works is by linking tobacco to `peripheral cues,' positive attributes including flavoring that may contribute to positive appraisal and lower harm perceptions of flavored products. Across a sample of n = 256 VP and non-VP young adult non-tobacco users, this multi-level study (store- and individual-level) will build on the ELM to examine differences in real-world exposure to FTP advertising, emphasizing point of sale (POS) exposure, using 14 days of ecological momentary assessment (EMA). It will examine the influence of exposure on self-reported perceptions of FTPs (lower harm, more appeal). Participants will be assessed at 2-weeks and 6- months post-baseline to examine differential impacts of FTP advertising and attitudes on susceptibility, intentions, and tobacco use patterns (for FTPs and non-FTPs) as a function of VP group status. POS exposure will be validated by photographs of tobacco advertising in stores visited by respondents. Our specific aims are to (1) Identify the frequency of FTP and non-FTP advertising, and number and types of products characterized by FTP descriptors (e.g., menthol, cherry) in tobacco retailers visited by VP and non-VP young adults, (2) Compare differences in harm perceptions and appeal of FTP vs non-FTP advertisements and descriptors across VP and non-VP young adults and (3) Examine the predictive utility of FTP advertising and descriptor exposure on susceptibility, intentions to use, and initiation of FTPs (and non-FTPs) at 6-month follow-up across VP and non-VP young adults. This unique approach to triangulate data at the store and individual cognitive level will yield timely information given the increase in use of FTPs and the need to identify new policies and approaches to combat tobacco disparities in vulnerable groups. Achieving the aims of this R21 will establish whether these associations exist and provide the foundation for a larger study developing interventions correcting FTP misperceptions, promoting FTP de-normalization among young adults , and examining the likely impact of local policies to restrict FTP availability and advertising particularly in vulnerable communities. This study can also provide a basis for examining targeted marketing of other harmful products at POS. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to address a potential cause of tobacco use and, ultimately, cancer disparities by examining targeted advertising of flavored tobacco products in vulnerable populations compared with a non-vulnerable population of young adults in Washington, DC. It also explores a potential solution through examination of a restriction or ban on flavored tobacco products (FTP) as a way to reduce disparities. This project links level of exposure to FTP advertising and descriptors to: perceptions of harm and attractiveness of FTPs, susceptibility to using FTPs, and initiation of FTP use and differences in these relationships across vulnerable group status.",Exposure to flavored tobacco advertising and associations with future use in young adults: implications for health equity,9469479,R21CA208206,"['Advertising ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attitude ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communities ', ' Cues ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Marketing ', ' Menthol ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Persuasive Communication ', ' Persuasion ', ' Public Policy ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sales ', ' Smoking ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' African ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Policies ', ' Respondent ', ' Descriptor ', ' Exposure to ', ' Consensus ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' Flavoring ', ' Flavoring Agents ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' cancer risk ', ' authority ', ' Cigarette ', ' Cigar ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' hookah ', ' waterpipe ', ' water pipe ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cherry - dietary ', ' Cherries ', ' Advertisements ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Population Group ', ' ward ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' exposure to tobacco ', ' tobacco exposure ', ' attributable death ', ' attributable mortality ', ' cost ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' combat ', ' social science research ', ' health equity ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' recruit ', ' cigarillos ', ' tobacco user ', ' ecigarette use ', ' ecig use ', ' e-cigarette use ', ' e-cig use ', ' electronic cigarette use ', ' ']",NCI,TRUTH INITIATIVE FOUNDATION,R21,2018,114061,0.10821256550795359
"RCT of An Internet Cessation Program Plus Online Social Network for HIV + Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are 1.1 million persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the US: 60% smoke cigarettes and 75% are interested in quitting. Two-thirds of PLWH use the Internet, making this a promising avenue to deliver smoking cessation treatment. Almost none are currently accessing smoking cessation interventions designed to meet their specific needs and concerns. Cigarette smoking is responsible for 24%--61% of deaths among PLWH, and 30% of non-AIDS defining malignancies. It is driving the alarming rise in lung cancers in this highly vulnerable population. The lack of access to proven, effective, culturally appropriate tobacco cessation services represents a health disparity of the first order.  Cessation websites offer smokers convenience, low (or no) cost, and anonymity; however, there are no publicly available web-based cessation programs specifically designed for PLWH smokers. Smokers living with HIV have high rates of nicotine dependence, anxiety, depression, loneliness, and substance use. We developed Positively Smoke Free on the Web (PSFW), a theory-driven, culturally tailored web-based program designed to address the specific needs of PLWH smokers. Our NCI-funded R21 pilot of PSFW demonstrated moderate-high levels of adherence and yielded higher 3-month abstinence rates compared to standard care (10% vs. 4%). Our prior research on web-based cessation interventions has shown that smokers who participate in an online community - whether passively reading posts by others or actively engaging in online discussions - are more than twice as likely to achieve abstinence even after controlling for a broad range of covariates. In preparation for the proposed study, our partners at the American Legacy Foundation have enhanced and modernized PSFW by integrating an online community platform (now ""PSFW+""), developing a training protocol for PLWH smoker seed users (to provide a critical mass of social network participants), and recruiting and training 11 PLWH smokers for this role. The prototype PSFW+ application has been successfully alpha- and beta-tested in anticipation of the randomized controlled trial.  We propose a study that will compare the efficacy of the PSFW+ smoking cessation website to an attention- matched website promoting cardiovascular health in a randomized controlled trial with repeated measures at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months. Participants will be N=550 PLWH smokers interested in quitting in the next 30 days. All participants will be offered nicotine replacement therapy. It is hypothesized that PSFW+ will outperform the control condition on the primary outcome of 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 months post-randomization. Secondary aims and exploratory analyses will examine theory-driven hypotheses about the mediators and moderators of treatment outcome (e.g., depression, anxiety, social support, loneliness, self-efficacy). Establishing the effectiveness of a web-based smoking cessation program for PLWH that has broad reach and could be scaled to reach PLWH smokers throughout the US would not only represent an enormous advance in the fight against tobacco use in PLWH, but would also provide a clearer understanding of the role of targeted, web-based health interventions in comprehensive HIV care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Smoking rates among persons living with HIV (PLWH) are triple those in the general adult population in the US, and there are few, if any, cessation resources available that address their particular needs. This study will examine the efficacy of a web-based smoking cessation program and online social network specifically developed for PLWH. As one of the first studies of its kind, the proposed research will yield important insights into an intervention approach that could be scaled nationally to reach PLWH smokers throughout the US.",RCT

"ASPiRE: Advancing Science & Practice in the Retail Environment Center Summary/Abstract  New population-based interventions to restrict the sales and distribution of tobacco products are increasingly common at the local level, despite little systematic research on these efforts. The retail environment – comprised of the built environment (retailer quantity and location) and consumer environment (price, product availability, and promotion at the point of sale) – is a critical emerging opportunity for tobacco control. The overall goal of the Advancing Science and Practice in the Retail Environment (ASPiRE) Program Project is to build a rigorous, scientific evidence base for effective tobacco control in the retail environment to reduce tobacco use, tobacco-related disparities, and the public health burdens of tobacco including tobacco- related cancers. The specific aims of ASPiRE are to: 1) fill important gaps in the evidence base about the impact of tobacco retailer density and tobacco product availability and promotion on tobacco use and tobacco- related health outcomes (e.g., cancer); 2) evaluate the potential of local retail interventions to reduce socioeconomic disparities in exposure to the tobacco retail environment and improve cessation outcomes; 3) evaluate the underlying mechanisms and effectiveness of different options for intervening in the retail environment to increase the costs of tobacco use, increase cessation, and reduce consumption; and 4) enhance community capacity to implement evidence-based tobacco control practices in retail settings.  Three innovative research projects are integral to these aims and will examine the degree to which tobacco retailer density contributes to tobacco use and tobacco-related disease over time using archival data (Project 1), evaluate the impact of local retail interventions on tobacco use outcomes using data from a longitudinal panel of tobacco users adult smokers (Project 2) and develop computational modeling to simulate community-level interventions to understand how changes in the built and consumer environments may lead to improved public health (Project 3). Each research project will produce unique and complementary scientific knowledge that will advance the retail tobacco control evidence base.  The administrative core and two shared resource cores that specialize in 1) data management and biostatistics, and 2) dissemination and implementation will enhance the impact and reach of the scientific aims and increase synergy among the research and results from the three projects. ASPiRE takes a `team science' approach and leverages a successful, enduring collaboration that was established over 5 years of previous funding from NCI's State & Community Tobacco Control Initiative (U01-CA154281). If ASPiRE achieves its aims, it will be a national resource for the emerging area of tobacco control retail science and speed translation of retail science into evidence-based community practices that will reduce the public health burden of tobacco use. Project Narrative Tobacco use causes nearly half of a million premature deaths each year from cancer, cardiovascular disease, and pulmonary illnesses. This Program Project will identify the role that tobacco retail outlets play in promoting tobacco use and causing tobacco-related illnesses. National, city-based, and computation modeling studies will specifically focus on the health impacts of where retailers are located, the types of tobacco products retailers sell, and the prices retailers charge for those products.",ASPiRE: Advancing Science & Practice in the Retail Environment,9491068,P01CA225597,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Charge ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Expenditure ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Industry ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Marketing ', ' Study models ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Peer Review ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sales ', ' Science ', ' Standardization ', ' Taxes ', ' Tobacco ', ' Translations ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' base ', ' community planning ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Training ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' tobacco company ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Location ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' consumer product ', ' data management ', ' synergism ', ' Cigarette ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Tobacco-Related Carcinoma ', ' tobacco-related cancer ', ' tobacco-induced cancer ', ' Data ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' discount ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' tobacco control ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' exposure to tobacco ', ' tobacco exposure ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' community based practice ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' smoke-free policy ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' built environment ', ' data archive ', ' tobacco user ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,P01,2018,2575060,0.1608681134374394
"Effect of Tobacco Advocacy at the State Level PROJECT SUMMARY Tobacco use remains the nation's leading cause of preventable death. The emergence of e-cigarettes and legalized marijuana use, and the increasing concentration of tobacco use among some racial and ethnic groups, poor people, people with mental illness, and young adults are all changing the environment in which tobacco control efforts take place. High quality state and local tobacco control policies and programs not only prevent tobacco use and disease, but can be an important component of health care cost containment, a key concern at all levels of government and in the private sector. The tobacco industry continues to work to stop or blunt these efforts' effectiveness. All tobacco control programs are not equally effective at reducing smoking and health care costs, making it important to quantify the effects of tobacco control policies and programs. Our research will inform the development and implementation of effective tobacco control policies and programs in this rapidly changing environment through three specific aims: 1. Identify and analyze the new challenges to state and local tobacco control policymaking and program  implementation to inform the development of effective responses to these challenges. 2. Identify policy and demographic determinants of smoking initiation, progression and cessation, including  smokefree policy coverage and cigarette taxes, as well as variation in these determinants by race/ethnicity  and socioeconomic status. 3. Quantify the magnitude and quality of tobacco control program spending across states and the relationship  between associated changes in smoking behavior and healthcare expenditures. We will pursue Aim 1 through a series of detailed case studies of the development and effects of state tobacco control policies and programs on tobacco use. For Aim 2 we will merge national datasets, beginning with the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, with policy data on clean indoor air laws, tobacco taxes, price and demographic variables to develop new models of smoking behavior that will provide a framework for better understanding how these policies affect individual behavior and health disparities. We will pursue Aim 3 using modern econometric methods to quantify the effects of state tobacco control programs, allowing for differences in program effectiveness on smoking behavior and, in turn, the effects of both smoking and tobacco control programs on health care costs. This more sophisticated understanding of what tobacco control policies and programs are most effective, together with understanding the tobacco industry's evolving efforts to block these policies, will help public health professionals develop, implement, and defend effective tobacco control policies and strategies that respond to this changing environment.   PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death, accounting for 1/3 of all cancer deaths and 540,000 deaths annually. Reducing this burden requires understanding the health impact (including on associated healthcare costs) of different tobacco control programs and policies as well as how the tobacco industry works to block these efforts and maintain a favorable environment to promote tobacco use. This research will inform health authorities on how to use increasingly limited resources most efficiently to prevent tobacco use and promote cessation.",Effect of Tobacco Advocacy at the State Level,9490317,R01DA043950,"['Accounting ', ' Aerosols ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cost Control ', ' Cost Containment ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' health-care expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Laws ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Nicotine ', ' Private Sector ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Smoking ', ' Taxes ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' Work ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Businesses ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Advocacy ', ' improved ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Shapes ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' tobacco company ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' interest ', ' authority ', ' Cigarette ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' Environmental Tobacco Smoke ', ' secondhand smoke ', ' second hand smoke ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Legal ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Smoking and Health ', ' Smoking and Health Research ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' tobacco control ', ' tobacco use prevention ', ' prevent tobacco use ', ' tobacco prevention ', ' Population ', ' FSPTCA ', ' Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act ', ' ecigarette ', ' ecig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' legalized marijuana ', ' legalized cannabis ', ' legal marijuana ', ' cannabis legalization ', ' marijuana legalization ', ' cannabis use ', ' THC use ', ' THC co-use ', ' marijuana use ', ' tribal lands ', ' National Longitudinal Survey of Youth ', ' preventable mortality ', ' preventable death ', ' ecigarette use ', ' ecig use ', ' e-cigarette use ', ' e-cig use ', ' electronic cigarette use ', ' ']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2018,526209,0.21564291047954182
"Expanding the Reach of a Validated Smoking-Cessation Intervention: A Spanish-language RCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco smoking is the leading preventable cause of cancer mortality. Pharmacotherapy and behavioral counseling have demonstrated independent and additive effects toward aiding smoking cessation; however, counseling is rarely chosen by smokers. In contrast, minimal self-help interventions, such as smoking cessation pamphlets or booklets have much wider potential reach, yet their efficacy has been largely disappointing, with incremental abstinence rates averaging only 1 percent. Given the high dissemination potential, any significant improvement in the efficacy of self-help would have high public health impact with respect to smoking and smoking related illness and mortality. In contrast to traditional self-help, a notable exception to the historically poor efficacy of self-help has been extended self-help that provides evidence-based content over a prolonged period of time. A recently completed trial of such an intervention, comprising 18 months of contact with a written social support component, revealed high efficacy throughout the 24-month follow-up period, as well as high cost- effectiveness. Wide-scale implementation and public health impact would be enhanced by the availability of a Spanish-language version to reach the largest and fastest growing ethnic minority population of smokers. The current smoking prevalence among Hispanic/Latino adults varies by cultural subgroup, with prevalence above 30 percent, for example, among those of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent. Greater smoking prevalence is also associated with lower income and education, and greater US acculturation. Prior research has demonstrated that Hispanic/Latino smokers face unique challenges such as lower awareness and acceptability of pharmacotherapies and less assistance with smoking cessation from their health providers. The goal of this study is to address this gap in cessation by conducting a randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of a culturally appropriate Spanish-language version of the existing validated self-help intervention. The efficacy of this intervention will be tested against two control conditions. The first, Usual Care, will consist of a traditional self-help intervention in Spanish. The second, Contact Control, will match the novel intervention on time and contact. These two control conditions address external and internal validity, respectively. It is hypothesized that, compared to both the Usual Care and the Contact Control conditions, the intervention will produce higher abstinence rates throughout 24 months of outcome assessment. Potential moderator variables will be evaluated to guide further refinement and targeting of the intervention. This would be the first study to test a Spanish-language adaptation of a validated self-help smoking cessation intervention in a nation-wide RCT. If efficacy is demonstrated in this study, a low-cost, easily disseminated, evidence-based intervention would be available, with the potential to reduce ethnic health disparities associated with tobacco smoking. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Research is needed to develop and validate interventions for ethnic minority smokers. The aim of the proposed study is to test a Spanish-language adaptation of a validated and easily implemented self-help intervention in a nation-wide clinical trial. Efforts aimed at promoting tobacco abstinence among this underserved population could have significant public health implications, including the potential reduction of ethnic health disparities associated with tobacco smoking.",Expanding the Reach of a Validated Smoking-Cessation Intervention: A Spanish-language RCT,9526457,R01CA199143,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Awareness ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology) ', ' Moderator Variables ', ' Epidemiologic Effect Modifiers ', ' Conditional Variables ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Language ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' tobacco dependent ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Letters ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Smoker ', ' Tobacco smoking behavior ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' self help ', ' trait ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disorder later incidence prevention ', ' relapse prevention ', ' recurrence prevention ', ' disorder recurrence prevention ', ' disease recurrence prevention ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Dominican ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' High Prevalence ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' tobacco abstinence ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Abstinence ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' smoking intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' efficacy testing ', ' smoking relapse ', ' arm ', ' Preventable cancer cause ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' Cuban ', ' racial minority ', ' recruit ', ' intervention cost ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"Small Financial Incentives to Promote Smoking Cessation in Safety Net Hospital Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. Although the prevalence of smoking has declined to 18.1 percent among U.S. adults, 27.9 percent of those living in poverty report current smoking. Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking cessation. There is mounting evidence that offering incentives for abstinence (i.e., Contingency Management [CM]) may be an effective approach for promoting short-term smoking cessation, though few studies have demonstrated longer-term effectiveness. In addition, little attention has been paid to socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers specifically (e.g., safety- net hospital populations) in CM intervention studies. Our preliminary work indicates that offering small escalating financial incentives for smoking abstinence dramatically increases short-term cessation rates among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers when incentives are included as an adjunct to standard clinic- based smoking cessation treatment. However, additional work is needed to evaluate the influence of this CM approach in the longer-term with a rigorous and adequately powered trial. Thus, the aims of the proposed study are to: 1) evaluate the longer-term impact of an adjunctive, low-cost CM intervention (relative to usual care) on smoking abstinence rates among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals participating in a safety-net hospital smoking cessation program, and 2) identify treatment mechanisms and contextual factors associated with cessation outcomes among intervention participants using both traditional and ecological momentary assessment approaches. Participants seeking smoking cessation treatment at an urban safety net hospital (N = 320) will be randomly assigned to 1) usual care (UC; n = 160) or 2) UC plus financial incentives for biochemically-confirmed abstinence (CM; n = 160). Those randomized to the CM intervention will have the opportunity to earn small gift cards for biochemically-verified abstinence through 12 weeks post-quit. Specifically, participants may earn $20 for abstinence on the quit date, and this amount will increase by $5 with each successive abstinent visit through 4 weeks post-quit ($150 total). Participants may additionally earn $50 gift cards for abstinence at 8 and 12 weeks post-quit. Biochemically-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks post-quit (longer-term abstinence) will be the primary outcome variable, though smoking status will be assessed at all visits. We also hope to gain a better understanding of CM treatment mechanisms and to identify other factors that directly influence cessation via traditional questionnaire and smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment approaches. Smartphone technology allows for ""real-time"" data collection to more accurately capture important cessation-related variables, and will be used to deliver gain-framed messages to support and strengthen the CM intervention. Findings will provide insight about new treatment targets for intervention research, and will demonstrate an effective, inexpensive, and easily implementable means by which to improve longer-term smoking cessation rates among economically disadvantaged smokers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking cessation. Offering incentives for abstinence is an effective approach for promoting short-term smoking cessation, though the longer-term effectiveness of this approach has not been established and little attention has been paid to socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers. The proposed study will evaluate the longer-term impact of offering adjunctive, low- cost financial incentives on smoking cessation among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals participating in a safety-net hospital smoking cessation program, and identify treatment mechanisms and contextual factors associated with cessation using both traditional and ecological momentary assessment approaches.",Small Financial Incentives to Promote Smoking Cessation in Safety Net Hospital Patients,9514043,R01CA197314,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Attention ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant neoplasm of larynx ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Larynx ', ' Malignant Laryngeal Tumor ', ' Malignant Laryngeal Neoplasm ', ' Larynx Cancer ', ' Laryngeal Cancer ', ' Financial cost ', ' Data Collection ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' oral cavity cancer ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Tobacco smoking behavior ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' psychosocial ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Visit ', ' Malignant neoplasm of esophagus ', ' oesophageal cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Esophagus ', ' Malignant Esophageal Tumor ', ' Malignant Esophageal Neoplasm ', ' Esophagus Cancer ', ' Esophageal Cancer ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' stressor ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' contingency management ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Gifts ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Renal carcinoma ', ' Renal Cancer ', ' Kidney Carcinoma ', ' Kidney Cancer ', ' Adherence ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Smoking Status ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' safety net ', ' Abstinence ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' social science research ', ' treatment adherence ', ' clinical practice ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' financial incentive ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' preventable mortality ', ' preventable death ', ' smoking abstinence ', ' intervention participants ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,R01,2018,131402,0.28968693142061597
"Using Mobile Technology to Understand and Encourage Mindfulness for Smoking Cessa DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Although most smokers indicate interest in quitting, only 6% quit each year. Mindfulness-based interventions show promise for improving smoking cessation; however, underlying mechanisms are unclear. Furthermore, there is a dearth of research on mindfulness and smoking cessation in underserved populations (i.e., members of racial/ethnic minority groups and individuals with low socioeconomic status [SES]), who often have greater difficulty quitting smoking and experience profound tobacco-related health disparities. Mobile health technology (""mHealth"") is revolutionizing healthcare and might be used to elucidate mechanisms underlying mindfulness and enhance mindfulness-based interventions for smoking cessation.  Claire Adams, Ph.D., an Assistant Professor of Psychology at the Catholic University of America (CUA), is seeking five years of support through the K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award for training and research related to mindfulness, mHealth, advanced statistics, and health disparities research. Dr. Adams' overarching career goals are to inform, develop, evaluate, and disseminate mindfulness- based interventions to promote smoking cessation, prevent cancer and other chronic diseases, and enhance well-being in diverse populations. Through the proposed training plan, Dr. Adams will expand her knowledge and skills with regard to mindfulness, smoking cessation, and health disparities research. In order to fill important gaps in her experience thus far, she will gain specialized training related to mHealth and the advanced statistics necessary for analyzing multi-level and longitudinal data. Dr. Adams will work with her mentoring team (led by Dr. David Wetter and comprising experts in fields of psychology, engineering, public health, and biostatistics) to complete formal coursework, specialized workshops, and directed readings.  Primary research aims are to: 1) utilize advanced statistics and mHealth technology to determine mechanisms through which mindfulness influences smoking cessation, and 2) design and test the feasibility of a mHealth-enhanced mindfulness-based intervention for smoking cessation. Toward the first aim, Dr. Adams will learn and apply advanced multilevel modeling techniques to determine mechanisms underlying mindfulness and smoking cessation in three existing datasets that include diverse samples of smokers. Toward the second aim, Dr. Adams will work with her mentoring team to develop and test the feasibility of a mindfulness-based smoking cessation treatment that is supplemented by between-session text messaging. This program aims to deliver personalized intervention to participants in their natural environments and in the moments when they might benefit most. Findings from this feasibility study will inform and provide pilot data for an R01 application of a larger randomized controlled trial. Dr. Adams will conduct the proposed work at CUA, which will provide space, time, equipment, and other resources for research and training.  The proposed research will be the first known to use mobile technology to examine mechanisms underlying mindfulness and smoking, as well as the first known study to use text messaging to enhance mindfulness- based smoking cessation. Furthermore, all proposed studies will target racially/ethnically diverse and low-SES populations (who are at disproportionate risk for tobacco-related health disparities and have not typically served as participants in mindfulness research). Research findings could be critical in moving forward the scientific study of mindfulness, improving patient outcomes in smoking cessation interventions, preventing cancer and other chronic diseases, and improving quality of life in diverse and underserved populations. The proposed training and research plan would launch Dr. Adams as an independent clinical scientist who conducts multidisciplinary research to inform, develop, evaluate, and disseminate innovative mindfulness- based interventions to improve health in diverse populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S., and mindfulness-based interventions show promise for improving smoking cessation.

"Unjust Targeting: How Marketing Features Impact Consumer Response and Tobacco Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research contributes to Tobacco Regulatory Science by connecting (1) tobacco marketing features with (2) consumer affective, cognitive and physiological response to marketing images and (3) tobacco product perceptions and use outcomes in ethnically diverse populations (African American, Asian American, Latino and non-Hispanic white). By identifying key features of tobacco marketing (e.g. colors, descriptors, branding, marketing claims) that optimize consumer response to the marketing and ultimately connecting that to tobacco use outcomes over time, this project adds to the evidence base used to regulate tobacco marketing. This project will provide a comprehensive description of the tobacco marketing landscape and an inventory of 'high impact' tobacco marketing features that produce inequitable outcomes in tobacco use. Additionally, by examining consumers' affective, cognitive and physiologic response to ads, this project will illuminate the underlying mechanisms through which these marketing features operate. The aims of this project are to: (1) describe key features of tobacco marketing targeted towards (a) African Americans, (b) Asian Americans, (c) Latinos (including Mexican Americans, Cubans and Puerto Ricans) and (d) non-Hispanic whites; (2) identify how marketing features impact response to ads for Latinos and Latino subgroups; and (3) for each ethnic group, demonstrate how tobacco product use is initiated and changes as a result of awareness of advertising and having a favorite ad and identify marketing features associated with tobacco product use. To accomplish these aims, the proposed research leverages the infrastructures of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study and the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), linking ad-level data from a PATH ad-hoc study that content codes tobacco marketing images with longitudinal PATH data and conducting an ancillary study to the HCHS/SOL assessing self-report and physiological response to tobacco ads. To execute these aims, I will work with a team of mentors who are internationally known scholars. Dr. John Elder, Professor in the Graduate School of Public Health at San Diego State University will be my primary mentor; Dr. John Pierce, Professor in the Department of Family & Preventive Medicine and Moores Cancer Center at UC-San Diego and a lead investigator on the PATH study and Dr. Lourdes Baezconde-Garbanati, Associate Professor of Preventive Medicine at the University of Southern California and Project Leader on the USC Tobacco Center of Regulatory Sciences (P50) will be secondary mentors. This training will provide me with expertise in longitudinal, epidemiological study design, management and analysis, tobacco use health disparities, tobacco regulatory policy and physiological measurement of ad response. This will facilitate my integration into the Tobacco Regulatory Science community and allow me to achieve my long-term career goal of becoming an independent, leading investigator and expert in Tobacco Regulatory Science with a specific focus on communication-based research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project impacts public health by providing knowledge necessary for the effective regulation of tobacco marketing. By linking specific features of tobacco marketing (e.g. colors, marketing claims, descriptors, branding) to consumers' response to ads and their tobacco product perceptions and use behaviors, this work provides the FDA with insight into how specifically tobacco marketing produces inequitable tobacco use outcomes. Ultimately, this will facilitate tobacco marketing regulations that will result in lower rates of tobacco use and disease and death associated with tobacco use.",Unjust Targeting: How Marketing Features Impact Consumer Response and Tobacco Use,9544919,K01DA037903,"['Advertising ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Archives ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Family Practice ', ' family medicine ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Marketing ', ' Mentors ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Perception ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' RQ2 ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Central American ', ' Policies ', ' Research Activity ', ' Measurement ', ' Descriptor ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' tobacco company ', ' South American ', ' Pattern ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' preference ', ' professor ', ' skills ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' risk perception ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dominican ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Tobacco Epidemiology ', ' Tobacco Use Epidemiology ', ' Characteristics ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' exposure to tobacco ', ' tobacco exposure ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Affective ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' arm ', ' health data ', ' associate professor ', ' associate faculty ', ' mid-career faculty ', ' HCHS/SOL cohort ', ' HCHS/SOL Study ', ' Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' Cuban ', ' Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health ', ' tobacco regulatory science ', ' ']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,219032,0.11660224081716487
"Evaluating how licensing-law strategies will change neighborhood disparities in tobacco retailer density PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Adding or modifying tobacco licensing laws is becoming an increasingly popular tobacco control approach, but the implications for health disparities is unknown. Currently, it is well-documented that the density of tobacco retailers is greater in low-income, African American, and Hispanic neighborhoods. Marketing at these retailers' points of sale impacts the social environment and can have powerful effects on promoting initiation and inhibiting cessation. With licensing-law strategies, communities can not only require stores to obtain a license to sell tobacco, but can set stipulations to granting these licenses (e.g., capping the number of retailers in an area, or banning retailers from within 1000 feet of a school). Research suggests this public policy approach is an effective means for reducing the number of tobacco retailers and their corresponding point-of-sale marketing. However, some of these strategies could be more beneficial for affluent, low-minority areas than for low-income, high-racial/ethnic minority areas—what the proposal is referring to as “high risk” areas. This potential outcome is particularly troubling given that low-income, African American, and Hispanic populations also exhibit some of the highest rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the purpose of this R21 proposal is to evaluate in Ohio the equality-impact of the four major licensing-law strategies that have been proposed to restrict tobacco retailers. Aim 1 will test whether reducing the number and/or density of tobacco retailers will reduce inequalities in the distribution of tobacco retailers. Aim 2 will test whether restricting tobacco retailers from being close to schools will reduce current inequalities in the distribution of tobacco retailers. Aim 3 will test whether banning tobacco sales in pharmacies will exacerbate inequalities in the distribution of tobacco retailers. Analyses will be conducted using spatial modeling techniques, which have rarely been used in tobacco control research. With a list that has already been acquired of all 10,722 tobacco retailers in Ohio, analyses will begin by establishing the current, pre-policy state of tobacco retailer density, at the census-tract level. Each aim will then model the effects of a licensing-law restriction and estimate the post- policy retailer density. Finally, each policy will be evaluated in terms of its equality-impact (whether it will provide less, equal, or greater benefit to vulnerable groups). Three benchmarks will be used: the % reduction in retailer density is not greater for low-risk census tracts; the strength of the relation between tobacco retailer density and sociodemographics has diminished; and the post-policy density of tobacco retailers is not greater in low-risk census tracts. This novel project will provide much-need information on the relative equality-impact of the major licensing-law strategies. Findings will guide state and community efforts away from licensing-law strategies that will inadvertently widen the nation's cancer disparities and toward licensing-law strategies that will have a positive equality-impact. As the first project to integrate licensing-law research with disparities research, this project could significantly change the direction of tobacco control research and policy. PROJECT NARRATIVE: RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH An increasingly popular tobacco control approach is licensing-law strategies, whereby communities set stipulations to granting tobacco-retail licenses (e.g., capping the number of retailers in an area, or banning retailers from within 1000 feet of a school). Our research is relevant to public health because it will provide the first information on which licensing-law strategies are effective for low-income, high-racial/ethnic minority areas, compared to affluent, low-minority areas. The project is relevant to NCI's mission because it will help guide tobacco control efforts toward licensing-law strategies that will reduce income- and race/ethnicity-based cancer disparities.",Evaluating how licensing-law strategies will change neighborhood disparities in tobacco retailer density,9540835,R21CA212308,"['Advertising ', ' Boston ', ' Budgets ', ' California ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' foot ', ' Gases ', ' Grant ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interest Group ', ' Laws ', ' Marketing ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Ohio ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sales ', ' Schools ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' sound ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Specialist ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' density ', ' rural area ', ' Area ', ' Licensing ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Smoker ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' tobacco company ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Modeling ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Street Address ', ' ST-ADDR ', ' Legal ', ' Low income ', ' Tobacco Control Research ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' tobacco control ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' exposure to tobacco ', ' tobacco exposure ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' social science research ', ' ']",NCI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,161950,0.12679982670830442
"A Family-Focused Intervention for Asian American Male Smokers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Family-Focused Intervention for Asian American Male Smokers Smoking prevalence remains high in subgroups of Asian American men, particularly among those with low English proficiency (LEP) and immigrants from cultures where smoking prevalence is high, including Chinese and Vietnamese. The 2011-12 California Health Interview Survey estimates that nearly half (46%) of all Asian male smokers in California are either Chinese or Vietnamese. The smoking prevalence's among LEP Chinese and Vietnamese men were 32% and 43%, respectively, compared to 16% of the general California male population. We developed a family-focused intervention utilizing lay health worker (LWH) outreach that integrates formative qualitative research and selected constructs from Social Network Theory, Social Cognitive Theory, and the Trans-theoretical Model. The intervention involves 2 small group education sessions with dyads of smokers and family members, and 2 follow-up individual telephone calls delivered by LHWs over 2 months. Our single-group pilot trial with 96 dyads of Chinese and Vietnamese male daily smokers and their family members showed a high feasibility of recruiting unmotivated smokers (42% were at ""precontemplation""), and a promising 7-day point prevalence abstinence rate of 30% at 3 months with independent corroboration from family members. The first aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the family-focused intervention in promoting smoking cessation in Chinese and Vietnamese male smokers. The second aim is to explore mediators to identify key psychosocial and behavioral processes that underlie how the intervention affects the processes of quitting and maintaining abstinence. We will conduct a 2-arm cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) with assessments at baseline, 6 and 12 months following intervention initiation. The RCT involves 60 lay health workers (LHWs); each recruits and delivers interventions to 6 dyads of one male daily smoker and one family member from his household, for a total 360 smoker-family dyads. Half of the LHWs, stratified by Asian subgroup and smoking history, will be randomized to the family-focused intervention group and the other half will be assigned to an attention control condition receiving education on healthy eating. All participants will receive written information on smoking cessation resources. We hypothesize that, at 6 and 12 month follow-up, the intervention smokers will be more likely to achieve biochemically verified smoking abstinence (7-day point prevalence), to report having made at least one 24-hour quit attempt, and to report using at least one evidence-based smoking cessation resource (quitline, medication, health professional advice) than smokers in the control condition. Using prospective quantitative data obtained from the RCT, and post-trial dyadic and individual interviews of 30 smokers and 30 family members selected based on abstinence experiences, we will explore mediators at individual, family and social network levels that explain how the intervention affects quitting and maintaining abstinence. The long-term goal is to understand effective ways to utilize family-based and social outreach strategies to reduce tobacco use disparities in hard-to-reach populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will examine the use of an innovative strategy that involves lay health worker outreach to mobilize smokers and their families to promote smoking cessation in Chinese and Vietnamese American men. This project will yield a significant public health impact as it addresses gaps in knowledge about effective strategies for treating tobacco dependence in underrepresented populations where smoking prevalence is disproportionately high such as among Chinese and Vietnamese American men.",A Family-Focused Intervention for Asian American Male Smokers,9490299,R01DA036749,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Asian Americans ', ' California ', ' Chinese American ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Household and Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Household ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' tobacco dependent ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Family member ', ' Social Network ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' Biochemical ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Immigrant ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Smoking History ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' post intervention ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' pilot trial ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' Network-based ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' FDA approved ', ' group intervention ', ' population based ', ' arm ', ' attentional control ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' recruit ', ' smoking abstinence ', ' ']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2018,647505,0.20319047704545187
"Sex Differences in the Mechanisms that Promote Nicotine Reward and Withdrawal DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use remains a major public health and economic concern, particularly in women who are more vulnerable to the long-term health consequences of smoking than men. Despite the magnitude of the problem, there is a fundamental knowledge gap in our understanding of the mechanisms that promote tobacco use in females. If this knowledge gap is not filled, then reducing tobacco use and developing specialized medications for female smokers will remain largely incomprehensible. The long-term goal of our research program is to identify the mechanisms that mediate tobacco use among different clinical populations that are uniquely susceptible to this problem. The objective of this renewal is to determine the neural mechanisms that promote tobacco use in females. The central hypothesis is that females are more susceptible to tobacco use than males because of stronger rewarding effects of nicotine and heightened anxiety produced by withdrawal from this drug. Our mechanistic hypothesis is that estradiol (E2) promotes the rewarding effects of nicotine and magnifies the stress produced by nicotine withdrawal in females. More specifically, we postulate that sex differences in response to nicotine are modulated within the neural circuits of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), where dopamine is increased following nicotine administration and decreased during withdrawal from this drug. Thus, females experience greater rewarding effects of nicotine in the presence of E2, which promotes dopamine release in the NAcc. Following repeated nicotine exposure, opponent processes develop to counteract the chronic over-activation of dopamine release. We suggest that the emergence of these opponent processes is evident during withdrawal from chronic nicotine as an increase in the stress hormone, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in the NAcc. This increase in CRF levels enhances the inhibitory tone in the NAcc, which results in a decrease in dopamine release during nicotine withdrawal. Thus, females experience greater anxiety during nicotine withdrawal in the presence of E2, which promotes the recruitment of opponent stress systems that suppress dopamine release in the NAcc. The proposed studies reflect a multi- disciplinary approach involving neurochemical, behavioral, and gene transfer techniques to compare sex differences in the rewarding effects of nicotine (Aim 1) and the aversive states produced by withdrawal (Aim 2) because both of these factors are believed to promote tobacco use in females. The approach to studying sex differences involves comparisons of male, female, and OVX female rats. If the removal of ovarian hormones reverses the proposed measures in females, then the role of E2 will be assessed in OVX rats that will receive E2 supplementation and will be tested following E2 or vehicle administration. At the completion of this project, our findings will help us develop a unifying hypothesis regarding the factors that promote tobacco use in females. This exemplifies the significance of this research because a better understanding of the mechanisms that fuel tobacco use in females will lead to more effective treatments to reduce health disparities in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because our findings will be an important step toward elucidating the neural substrates that promote addiction pathology in women.

Thus, our studies are relevant to the mission of NIH to support research aimed at reducing the burden of tobacco abuse, especially in women who are most vulnerable to the long-term effects of tobacco use.",Sex Differences in the Mechanisms that Promote Nicotine Reward and Withdrawal,9465435,R01DA021274,"['Anxiety ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone ', ' corticotropin releasing hormone ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticoliberin ', ' CRF-41 ', ' ACTH-Releasing Factor ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Estradiol ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' neurochemistry ', ' neurochemical ', ' Nicotine ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Withdrawal ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Self Administration ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' drug withdrawal ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Microdialysis ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Technology Transfer ', ' tobacco abuse ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' Infusion ', ' experience ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' novel ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Ovarian hormone ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' response ', ' Gene Transfer Techniques ', ' Transgenesis ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' Supplementation ', ' Gene Transfer ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' health economics ', ' Population ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' anxiety-like behavior ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' recruit ', ' nicotine consumption ', ' nicotine use ', ' exposure to nicotine ', ' nicotine exposure ', ' tobacco cessation treatment ', ' tobacco cessation intervention ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO,R01,2018,496518,0.09801115594627277
"Behavioral Economic Approach to Reducing Maternal Smoking in Disadvantaged Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking among women is a substantial U.S. public health problem that is highly associated with socioeconomic status, especially low educational attainment. It is also a direct contributor to health disparities. For example, smoking prevalence in the U.S. exceeds 30 percent among women with < 12 years of education compared to less than 6 percent for women with graduate degrees. Smoking prevalence among disadvantaged mothers is at strikingly high levels (40-60 percent). Disadvantaged women begin smoking at an earlier age, are heavier smokers, and are more likely to be nicotine dependent and to fail at smoking cessation. Not surprisingly, disadvantaged women are also at increased risk for smoking-related adverse health outcomes, including adversely impacting the health of their children through in-utero and second-hand smoke exposure (SHSe). Despite widespread awareness of the adverse health consequences of SHSe, almost 85 percent of U.S. children from low-income families are chronically exposed. SHSe, especially from maternal smoking, increases risk for infant death, chronic respiratory infections, asthma, and other longer-term medical problems, and is estimated to increase direct medical and life-lost costs in the U.S. by > $5 billion annually. Efficacious interventions to increase maternal smoking cessation and reduce childhood SHSe are sorely needed. In this application we are proposing to test the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an intervention for promoting smoking-cessation among economically disadvantaged mothers of young children (< 11 yrs) that is based in the conceptual framework of behavioral economics and uses financial incentives to motivate behavior change. We are proposing to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing (1) usual care for smoking cessation and reducing SHSe among children, (2) usual care combined with financial incentives for objectively verified smoking abstinence and (3) usual care combined with financial incentives and also with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) using innovative procedures to enhance medication efficacy. We hypothesize that both interventions involving financial incentives will increase biochemically-verified smoking abstinence in mothers and decrease SHSe in their children, but that the largest and most cost-effective treatment effects will be achieved by combining financial incentives with NRT. Behavioral-economic measures of decision-making biases and cigarette-price sensitivity will be examined as predictors of treatment response. Overall, the proposed study has the potential to advance knowledge on efficacious, cost-effective smoking cessation for maternal smokers and protection against SHSe in children. The study also has the potential to impact policies and clinical practices regarding recommended care for combating chronic SHSe in disadvantaged children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are proposing to examine new strategies for helping economically disadvantaged mothers of young children to quit smoking and better protect their children from the harmful effects of being regularly exposed to cigarette smoke. We are especially interested in whether offering financial incentives for quitting and medications to reduce nicotine withdrawal might increase the proportion of mothers who successfully quit smoking and reduce smoke exposure and related illnesses among their children.",Behavioral Economic Approach to Reducing Maternal Smoking in Disadvantaged Women,9532249,R01HD078332,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Cotinine ', ' Scotine ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Health ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mothers ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Withdrawal ', ' Pregnancy Complications ', ' pregnancy-related complications ', ' complications during pregnancy ', ' Public Health ', ' Respiratory Tract Infections ', ' Respiratory Infections ', ' Risk ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Policies ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' infant death ', ' infantile death ', ' infant demise ', ' death in first year of life ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Cigarette ', ' Participant ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Reporting ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effectiveness analyses ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Intake ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' therapy prediction ', ' predict treatment response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Community Practice ', ' Process ', ' discount ', ' in utero ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' motivated behavior ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' maternal smoking ', ' maternal cigarette smoking ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' discounting ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' treatment effect ', ' trial comparing ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' clinical practice ', ' efficacy testing ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' financial incentive ', ' follow up assessment ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' behavioral economics ', ' secondhand smoke exposure ', ' second hand smoke exposure ', ' exposure to tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to SHS ', ' exposure to ETS ', ' Passive Smoke Exposure ', ' environmental tobacco smoke exposure ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' lower income families ', ' recruit ', ' pediatric services ', ' child services ', ' smoking abstinence ', ' cigarette smoke exposure ', ' exposure to cigarette smoke ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2018,587466,0.20551022567533364
"Advancing Tobacco Use Treatment for African American Smokers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With a 50% greater relative-risk of smoking attributed lung cancer than Whites, and the highest overall rates of cancer incidence and mortality in the U.S., African Americans experience disproportionately greater tobacco- related disease burden. Striking health disparities exist despite the fact that African Americans have similar smoking prevalence as Whites, yet smoke fewer cigarettes per day (cpd). In fact, over half of all African American smokers are light smokers (smoke 10 or fewer cpd). To have an impact on the premature mortality of African American smokers, effective treatment for smokers across the smoking continuum must be identified. Varenicline, the leading first-line medication for tobacco use treatment, triples the likelihood of long-term abstinence relative to placebo in those smoking >10 cpd. To date, efficacy of varenicline has not been established in African American smokers or light smokers. The long-term goal of this research is to advance treatment for all African American smokers in order to reduce tobacco-related disease and death. Our primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of varenicline for tobacco use treatment among 500 African American smokers, including a full range of cpd, within a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. We will randomize participants in a 3:2 ratio to receive varenicline (1 mg bid; n=300) or placebo (n=200) for 12 weeks, along with individualized health education counseling for all participants. Our specific aims are to evaluate the efficacy of varenicline to promote abstinence in African American smokers across the continuum of smoking level, to examine efficacy in light smokers and also in moderate to heavy smokers, to characterize nicotine and carcinogen exposure, and to describe biopsychosocial characteristics of this group and evaluate in relation to abstinence. This innovative study will provide the first placebo-controlled evaluatin of varenicline in the full spectrum of African American smokers, and the first to examine varenicline in light smokers. Findings will contribute to advancing effective treatment for African American smokers and for light smokers, and enhancing individualized treatment. Increased treatment efficacy will have major impact on reducing tobacco- related morbidity and mortality in this high-risk population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans experience the highest levels of tobacco-related disease and death, despite smoking fewer cigarettes per day than Whites. Advancing treatment for African American smokers is a critical public health priority. This study will evaluate the efficacy of varenicline treatment to improve quit rates in African American daily smokers of all smoking levels, with the goal of reducing tobacco-related health disparities.",Advancing Tobacco Use Treatment for African American Smokers,9458163,R01DA035796,"['Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cotinine ', ' Scotine ', ' Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Goals ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Incidence ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Menthol ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Nicotine ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Placebos ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Tobacco ', ' Bupropion ', ' buproprion ', ' Wellbutrin ', ' Amfebutamone ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' improved ', ' Biochemical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' Cigarette ', ' Participant ', ' Treatment Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' Tobacco-Related Carcinoma ', ' tobacco-related cancer ', ' tobacco-induced cancer ', ' Adherence ', ' Intake ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Characteristics ', ' varenicline ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Carcinogen exposure ', ' Abstinence ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' FDA approved ', ' primary outcome ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' public health priorities ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' individualized medicine ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' exposure to nicotine ', ' nicotine exposure ', ' secondary end point ', ' secondary endpoint ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,625623,0.19890704333353695
"Health Literacy and Smoking Cessation in Low-SES, Diverse Smokers ABSTRACT Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death and disability in the U.S., and is becoming increasingly concentrated among individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES) and racial/ethnic minorities. Nearly half of U.S. adults have difficulties with health literacy (HL), and lack the ability to obtain, understand, and use basic health information to make important decisions about healthcare. As with smoking, low HL is common among racial/ethnic minorities and those with low SES. Low HL is associated with negative health behaviors, less engagement in preventive services, and poor health outcomes. It is also associated with current smoking, key established predictors of smoking relapse, and smoking relapse, even after controlling for sociodemographic indicators. Thus, low HL appears to be an independent risk factor for poor cessation outcomes among low- SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers. Efforts are needed to elucidate mechanisms of the association between low HL and relapse, and to develop smoking cessation interventions targeting low HL smokers.  This project aims to: 1) investigate mechanisms through which HL influences smoking cessation in low- SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers enrolled in cessation treatment using secondary analyses of traditional questionnaire and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data from 2 smoking cessation treatment studies; 2) conduct a qualitative investigation with low HL smokers to further elucidate mechanisms of the association between HL and cessation and inform the development of a theoretically-based, cessation treatment targeting the specific needs of low HL smokers; 3) develop and evaluate the preliminary efficacy of a smoking cessation intervention targeting low HL smokers compared to standard treatment; and 4) examine treatment effects on secondary outcomes of interest (e.g., differential dropout, treatment satisfaction, intention to quit smoking). Results will elucidate the complex relations between HL and cessation in underserved smokers, guide treatment for low HL smokers, and contribute to reducing tobacco-related health disparities.  Diana Stewart Hoover, Ph.D. is seeking 5 years of support through a NIDA K23 Career Development Award for the proposed training and research. In order to fill critical gaps in her experience, she will obtain specialized training in behavioral intervention development targeting underserved populations, advanced statistics for analyzing longitudinal and EMA data, and qualitative methods, particularly mixed methods. She will also expand her knowledge and skills related to HL, tobacco cessation, health disparities, and research ethics. Her training and research plans will support her long-term goal of establishing an independently-funded research program in cancer prevention and tobacco cessation, with a focus on reducing tobacco-related health disparities for individuals with low HL. A comprehensive training plan is described, combining mentored research, structured mentorship activities guided by established researchers in the field, formal coursework and workshops, and participation in seminars at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Nearly half of United States adults have difficulty with health literacy, defined as ""the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions."" Individuals with health literacy difficulties are more likely to be current smokers and to have less knowledge about smoking health risks and more trouble quitting smoking, putting them at risk for poor health (e.g., more frequent diagnoses of advanced stage cancer) and premature mortality. Efforts are needed to understand mechanisms through which health literacy influences smoking cessation in order to help identify treatment targets for smokers with health literacy difficulties, improve current smoking cessation interventions, and ultimately reduce the burden of tobacco-related health disparities.","Health Literacy and Smoking Cessation in Low-SES, Diverse Smokers",9547354,K23DA040933,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dropout ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Occupational Status ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Services ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Minority Stress and Cigarette Smoking among Sexual Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Health disparities in tobacco and other substance use are well documented between sexual minorities (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer) and heterosexual individuals across the lifespan. In particular, sexual minority youth (SMY) initiate tobacco use at younger ages and smoke cigarettes at higher rates than their heterosexual counterparts. Stigma and discrimination-related stressors specific to their minority sexual orientation (i.e., minority stressors) contribute to our understanding of health disparities among SMY. Minority stressors are often experienced daily by SMY. As such, SMY may smoke cigarettes as a way to cope with negative affect elicited by these stigma-based stressors. In fact, cross-sectional research shows that minority stressors are correlated with cigarette smoking and other substance use among SMY. Important limitations of the extant literature, however, include overreliance on cross-sectional and retrospective self-report data, failure to account for within- and between-individual differences in minority stressors and smoking behaviors, and lack of discernment of unique contributions of minority stressors on smoking beyond individual differences in daily general stressors, lifetime cumulative stress, and mental health. In addition, we know very little about the mediating mechanisms between minority stressors and cigarette smoking. Consistent with Institute of Medicine and the NIH Sexual and Gender Minority Research Coordinating Committee's call to expand our understanding of factors contributing to SMY’s higher levels of tobacco and other substance use, and in response to NIH PA-15-263’s focus on sexual minority health research, we propose an innovative exploratory study (R21). We propose a rigorous examination of the effects of minority stressors on cigarette smoking in real time in the natural environment among SMY using electronic experience sampling methods, specifically ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Our primary aims are to examine: a) the relationship between minority stressors and proximal changes in smoking in real time in the natural environment among 60 SMY who are regular smokers using EMA over a 30-day period; b) the effects of minority stressors on proximal changes in affect and craving; and, c) the mediating effects of affect and craving on the relationship between minority stressors and cigarette smoking. Our secondary aims of this study are to examine the effects of minority stressors on proximal changes in other substance use as well as to test resilience resources and contextual risk factors that might be associated with smoking. Findings from this exploratory study would have important theoretical implications for minority stress theory and inform the development of culturally sensitive smoking prevention and cessation interventions for SMY, targeting specific within-individual mechanisms as well as contextual factors. The proposed R21 will also provide pilot data for large scale research to more rigorously test the fine-grained psychosocial resilience and risk mechanisms associated with SMY’s smoking. PROJECT NARRATIVE: PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT  Sexual minority youth (SMY; i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer) are at increased risk for cigarette smoking and other substance use than their heterosexual peers. Cigarette smoking is a major public health concern, especially among adolescents, given the economic, societal, mortality, and morbidity burdens. The project will address how SMY’s experiences with stigma-related stressors related to their sexual orientation (i.e., minority stressors) are associated with cigarette smoking in order to inform and develop smoking interventions and improve the well-being of SMY.",Minority Stress and Cigarette Smoking among Sexual Minority Youth,9515048,R21MD010761,"['Accounting ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Attention ', ' Buffers ', ' Communities ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Translations ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Failure ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Smoker ', ' Cigarette Smoker ', ' bullying ', ' bully ', ' psychosocial ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Cigarette ', ' peer ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Smoking Prevention ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' minority health ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' smoking intervention ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' sexual minority ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' queer ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' prospective test ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' cigarette smoke ', ' Grain ', ' ']",NIMHD,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,177694,0.07438908135913051
"e-Decidete: Mobile Cessation Support for Latino Smokers Project Summary - eDecídete: Mobile Cessation Support for Latino Smokers  Latinos are less likely than non-Hispanic whites to have access to health, to have knowledge of existing smoking cessation resources, to receive advice to stop smoking, and to participate in smoking cessation programs. Mobile technologies can dramatically enhance the reach of effective smoking cessation interventions. However, the reach of mobile interventions among Latinos remains minimal despite the fact that Latinos utilize smartphones at a higher rate. The primary aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of eDecídete (Spanish for “you can choose”), an innovative 12 week mobile smoking cessation intervention based on this work that incorporates two elements: 1) a tablet-based e-health educational session that collects personal smoking-related information to develop an individualized quit plan and guide automated and interactive text messaging; and 2) a text messaging program that includes educational information, behavioral strategies, motivational and supportive messaging, and prompts to use pharmacotherapy to support smoking cessation. Aim 1. To evaluate the impact of the culturally accommodated eDecídete program versus standard care on smoking abstinence at Month 6 among Latino smokers. At Month 6, smokers in eDecídete will have significantly higher cotinine-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence (no cigarettes in the past 7 days) than smokers in the control arm. Aim 2. To assess therapeutic alliance, pharmacotherapy utilization, and self-efficacy as mediators of the presumed treatment effect on cotinine-verified 7-day smoking abstinence at Month 6 among Latino smokers. Our hypothesis is that eDecídete will have greater efficacy for smoking cessation than standard care by increasing therapeutic alliance, utilization of pharmacotherapy, and self-efficacy to quit. Aim 3. To conduct a process evaluation that can inform findings and future improvements. The evaluation will assess 1) satisfaction with the program and its components; 2) text-message system utilization patterns and common content themes in text message interactions among eDecídete participants. Project Narrative Latinos are the largest and fastest growing population in the U.S., and tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease and death among U.S. Latinos. Although enhancing tobacco use treatment for this at-risk, underserved group is a critical public health priority, little is known about effectively treating Latino smokers.

"Sex Differences in the Mechanisms that Promote Nicotine Reward and Withdrawal PROJECT DESCRIPTION  Tobacco use remains a major public health and economic concern, particularly in women who are more vulnerable to the long-term health consequences of smoking than men. Despite the magnitude of the problem, there is a fundamental knowledge gap in our understanding of the mechanisms that promote tobacco use in females. If this knowledge gap is not filled, then reducing tobacco use and developing specialized medications for female smokers will remain largely incomprehensible. The long-term goal of our research program is to identify the mechanisms that mediate tobacco use among different clinical populations that are uniquely susceptible to this problem. The objective of this proposal is to determine the neural mechanisms that promote tobacco use in females. The central hypothesis of this application is that females are more susceptible to tobacco use than males because of stronger rewarding effects of nicotine and heightened anxiety produced by withdrawal from this drug. Our mechanistic hypothesis is that estradiol (E2) promotes the rewarding effects of nicotine and magnifies the stress produced by nicotine withdrawal in females. More specifically, we postulate that sex differences in response to nicotine are modulated within the neural circuits of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), where dopamine is increased following nicotine administration and decreased during withdrawal from this drug. Thus, females experience greater rewarding effects of nicotine in the presence of E2, which promotes dopamine release in the NAcc. Following repeated nicotine exposure, opponent processes develop to counteract the chronic over-activation of dopamine release. We suggest that the emergence of these opponent processes is evident during withdrawal from chronic nicotine as an increase in the stress hormone, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in the NAcc. This increase in CRF levels enhances the inhibitory tone in the NAcc, which results in a decrease in dopamine release during nicotine withdrawal. Thus, females experience greater anxiety during nicotine withdrawal in the presence of E2, which promotes the recruitment of opponent stress systems that suppress dopamine release in the NAcc. The proposed studies reflect a multi- disciplinary approach involving neurochemical, behavioral, and gene transfer techniques to compare sex differences in the rewarding effects of nicotine (Aim 1) and the aversive states produced by withdrawal (Aim 2) because both of these factors are believed to promote tobacco use in females. The approach to studying sex differences involves comparisons of male, female, and OVX female rats. If the removal of ovarian hormones reverses the proposed measures in females, then the role of E2 will be assessed in OVX rats that will receive E2 supplementation and will be tested following E2 or vehicle administration. At the completion of this project, our findings will help us develop a unifying hypothesis regarding the factors that promote tobacco use in females. This exemplifies the significance of this research because a better understanding of the mechanisms that fuel tobacco use in females will lead to more effective treatments to reduce health disparities in women. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because our findings will be an important step toward elucidating the neural substrates that promote addiction pathology in women. Thus, our studies are relevant to the mission of NIH to support research aimed at reducing the burden of tobacco abuse, especially in women who are most vulnerable to the long-term effects of tobacco use.",Sex Differences in the Mechanisms that Promote Nicotine Reward and Withdrawal,9616453,R01DA021274,"['Anxiety ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone ', ' corticotropin releasing hormone ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticoliberin ', ' CRF-41 ', ' ACTH-Releasing Factor ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Estradiol ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' neurochemistry ', ' neurochemical ', ' Nicotine ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Withdrawal ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Self Administration ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' drug withdrawal ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Microdialysis ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Technology Transfer ', ' tobacco abuse ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' Infusion ', ' experience ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' novel ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Ovarian hormone ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' response ', ' Gene Transfer Techniques ', ' Transgenesis ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' Supplementation ', ' Gene Transfer ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' health economics ', ' Population ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' anxiety-like behavior ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' recruit ', ' nicotine consumption ', ' nicotine use ', ' exposure to nicotine ', ' nicotine exposure ', ' tobacco cessation treatment ', ' tobacco cessation intervention ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO,R01,2018,63656,0.09754297737354313
"Promoting Smoking Cessation among Individuals with Food Insecurity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite overall declines in the prevalence of cigarette smoking, smoking remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death. Smoking prevalence is also disproportionately concentrated among population groups that are economically disadvantaged, contributing to an uneven burden of tobacco-related health problems. Socioeconomic disparities in tobacco use persist largely because economically disadvantaged smokers are less likely to succeed in quitting than non-economically disadvantaged smokers. Many economically disadvantaged smokers are motivated to quit, but various life stressors pose significant barriers to cessation. One of the most stressful conditions in the experience of poverty is food insecurity, or the inability to afford adequate and appropriate foods needed to live an active and healthy life. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that food insecurity is independently associated with increased odds of smoking. However, proximal factors linking food insecurity and smoking are not well understood, and research has not extended this association towards informing cessation. Extant literature suggests that there are shared psychological (e.g., stress) and physiological (e.g., hunger) factors that may predispose food insecure smokers to encountering difficulties with quitting smoking. The overall goal of this proposal is to build the candidate's research expertise on the intersection of food insecurity, smoking, and quitting. This award will support the candidate's career development as a social and health psychologist whose research addresses social determinants of health to promote smoking cessation among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. The career development plan includes advanced training and mentorship in (1) social epidemiology, (2) qualitative research methods, (3) food insecurity and nutrition policy, and (4) smoking cessation intervention research. Aim 1 of the proposed study will determine whether the experience of food insecurity is associated with continued smoking among a nationally representative sample of low-income smokers, using extant longitudinal data from the 2001-2013 Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Aim 2 will target a subset of the local population with food insecurity—individuals seeking federal food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in San Francisco, California—to conduct surveys and in-depth interviews on the lived experience of food insecurity and its association with smoking behaviors and quitting. Aim 3 will develop and pilot test a smoking cessation outreach program that is delivered to 100 smokers with food insecurity in the context of SNAP, which provides a novel venue for smoking cessation and health promotion research. Taken together, this research and training plan will lay the foundation for a planned community-based randomized controlled trial of a smoking cessation intervention targeting households with food insecurity. This work has the potential to inform reductions in tobacco-related health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will identify how a key aspect of socioeconomic stress—the experience of food insecurity—is associated with smoking behaviors and smoking cessation among smokers who are economically disadvantaged. This study will also develop a smoking cessation promotion outreach program that is delivered in the context of a federal nutrition assistance program. Taken together, this research has the clear potential to address disproportionately high rates of smoking in economically disadvantaged populations by leveraging existing social service infrastructures for smoking cessation and health promotion.",Promoting Smoking Cessation among Individuals with Food Insecurity,9552125,K01DA043659,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Household ', ' Hunger ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' nutrition ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychologist ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' San Francisco ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' base ', ' career ', ' community planning ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Development Plans ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Nutrition Policy ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' Smoker ', ' non-smoker ', ' nonsmoker ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' outreach ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' psychological distress ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Population Group ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Smoking and Health ', ' Smoking and Health Research ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' pilot trial ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' safety net ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' evidence base ', ' social health determinants ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Secure ', ' food environment ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' panel study of income dynamics ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' secondary analysis ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,K01,2018,163502,0.1549178453754755
"Smoke-free Air Coalitions in Georgia and Armenia: A Community Randomized Trial SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Public health efforts in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) could be catalyzed by bolstering ways to optimally leverage local talents and resources, such as civil society. Developing effective models for aligning civil society and governmental public health at the local level in LMICs has the potential to impact a range of chronic diseases and risk factors, including tobacco. Local coalitions have been a dominant strategy in tobacco control in the US, with well-documented success in establishing smoke-free policies specifically. However, this approach has not been widely leveraged or well-studied in LMICs or those with less democratic traditions than the US. Instead, in many LMICs, smoke-free policy progress is largely initiated at the national level. Parallel civil society movements at the local level may be needed to build support for and compliance with policies. Given their sociopolitical histories and high tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) rates, Georgia (GE) and Armenia (AM) are two strategic settings for the proposed work. The smoking prevalence is 57.7% and 52.3% in men (6th and 11th highest in the world) and 5.7% and 1.5% in women, respectively. Moreover, our findings indicate extremely high rates of SHSe. However, we also documented high receptivity to public smoke-free policies despite high use rates, particularly in worksites and restaurants. This proposal is a well-justified extension of the literature and our prior work. We will build the capacity of GE and AM researchers to conduct high-quality mixed methods tobacco research and test the Community Coalition Action Theory as a framework for impacting local community-driven policy change. Researchers from the GE National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) and AM National Institute of Health (NIH) will collaborate with Emory to execute the proposed research, train tobacco control researchers within their organizations and partnering universities, and train practitioners within local communities to build local coalitions for tobacco control policy. We aim to: 1) conduct a matched-pair community randomized controlled trial in 28 municipalities in GE and AM to examine the impact of local coalitions promoting the adoption of smoke-free policies in worksites and restaurants, with the primary outcome of changes in SHSe over time; 2) assess how community context and coalition factors influence adoption of organizational and municipal smoke-free policies to provide an evidence- base for public health practice; 3) disseminate research findings regarding both the effectiveness and the process of establishing and maintaining coalitions, and consequently increasing smoke-free policies and reducing SHSe, to key stakeholders in GE and AM; and 4) capitalize on the proposed research and dissemination opportunities to build tobacco control research capacity within the GE NCDC, AM NIH, and partnering universities, as well as practice capacity within local public health centers and their civil society partners. Ultimately, the activities outlined in this proposal will serve as a catalyst for future action-oriented science and evidence-based practice to support tobacco control progress in this region more broadly. PROJECT NARRATIVE Developing effective models for aligning civil society and governmental public health at the local level in LMICs has the potential to impact a range of chronic diseases and risk factors, including tobacco. In this proposal, we will partner with the national public health agencies in Georgia and Armenia – two countries with extremely high rates of smoking and secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) and with sociopolitical histories not conducive to local activism; we will examine: 1) the impact of local coalitions promoting smoke-free policies in worksites and restaurants on SHSe in these challenging environments and 2) how community context and coalition factors influence adoption of organizational and municipal smoke-free policies. We will capitalize on the proposed research to build tobacco control research capacity in our partnering institutions, as well as practice capacity within local communities; results will be disseminated in order to serve as a catalyst for future action- oriented science and evidence-based practice to support tobacco control progress in this region.",Smoke-free Air Coalitions in Georgia and Armenia: A Community Randomized Trial,9547952,R01TW010664,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Air ', ' Armenia ', ' Attention ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Influentials ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Talents ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Workplace ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Policies ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Municipalities ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' research data dissemination ', ' research dissemination ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Advocate ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Tobacco Control Research ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' tobacco control ', ' Population ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' civil society ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' smoke-free policy ', ' secondhand smoke exposure ', ' second hand smoke exposure ', ' exposure to tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to SHS ', ' exposure to ETS ', ' Passive Smoke Exposure ', ' environmental tobacco smoke exposure ', ' model building ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' disparities in sex ', ' sex disparity ', ' ']",FIC,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,301562,0.10357744783394394
"A Facebook intervention for young sexual and gender minority smokers ABSTRACT  Sexual and gender minority (SGM) young adults (those who identify with a sexual orientation that is non- heterosexual such as gay, lesbian, or bisexual; or those who have a gender identity different from the sex assigned to them at birth) are disproportionately affected by tobacco use and associated health conditions; yet they face significant barriers to treatment participation and lower levels of satisfaction with treatment than others. Despite consensus that SGMs fare better when programs are tailored to address their specific needs, there is an extreme lack of such services available. Social media offer phenomenal opportunity to engage young people in intervention to treat tobacco use. Our group has developed the Facebook Tobacco Status Project (TSP), a stage-matched smoking cessation intervention for young adults based on US Clinical Practice Guidelines for smoking cessation, with evidence of short-term efficacy with young adult smokers. A culturally- tailored intervention may improve quit rates with SGM young adults. With pilot funds from UC San Francisco, our team has conducted mixed-methods formative work with SGM young adult smokers to inform the development of the Put It Out Project (POP) - an adaptation of TSP for SGM young adults. This project will bring together an interdisciplinary team with experience in the areas of SGM tobacco use, social media intervention, social media analytics, and clinical trials testing interventions for tobacco use, to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of POP. We will evaluate POP against the original TSP intervention in a randomized design with 120 SGM young adults throughout the United States who have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes and smoke cigarettes on 4 or more days per week. Participants will be recruited online and randomized to either POP with tailored content or the original TSP intervention. Both conditions will assign SGM participants to a private Facebook group and deliver a 90-day intervention including Facebook postings and weekly “The Dr. Is In” sessions with a trained counselor to guide group sessions. Two historical control conditions from our current clinical trial include assignment to TSP with non-SGM participants and referral to the NCI smokefree.gov program. All participants will complete baseline, 3-, and 6-month follow-up assessments online. Primary outcome will be biochemically-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence from tobacco. Within the TSP-SGM and TSP conditions, analyses will examine features of Facebook posts and user communications that are most strongly related to tobacco outcomes. This is the first project involving the target community to use Facebook to treat tobacco dependence among SGM young adults. Results will be used to design a clinical trial powered to detect significant effects across groups, thereby determining optimal intervention for a priority population. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will test a novel social media intervention targeting tobacco use among sexual and gender minority young adults. A tailored intervention that is delivered through the highly accessible and widely used medium of Facebook is expected to be engaging to a marginalized population, thereby reducing a key health inequity.

"Optimizing remotely delivered Smoking Cessation Services for Low-Income Smokers ABSTRACT Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of cancer and many other deadly diseases, and the burden of tobacco use is greatest among those with limited socioeconomic resources. Although we have driven down population smoking rates, and with them, cancer rates, roughly 28% of the socioeconomically disadvantaged still smoke regularly. Low-income (L-I) smokers also develop cancer at higher rates and struggle more to quit than do higher-income smokers. These disparities in tobacco use and its burdens must be addressed. Highly effective cessation treatment services that can be delivered remotely, flexibly, and conveniently with few cost or logistical barriers have the potential to achieve this aim. Tobacco quitline and SmokefreeTXT services are such treatment resources with demonstrated attractiveness and reach among L-I smokers. The current proposal will use an efficient factorial design to evaluate 4 smoking cessation interventions with vast reach and dissemination potential. The target population will be N=1,408 Medicaid-eligible or uninsured smokers who have recently enrolled in the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line (WTQL), but who report continued smoking 4- months following engagement in standard WTQL services. These treatment non-responders will be invited to participate in an experiment that will randomize them to 1 of 2 levels of each of the following 4 factors in a 2X2X2X2 design: WTQL counseling intensity (1 session vs. 4 sessions), medication intensity (2-week nicotine patch monotherapy vs. 4-week nicotine patch and lozenge combination therapy), a supportive text messaging program (SmokefreeTXT vs. none), and financial incentives (rewards of up to $150 for treatment engagement vs. no treatment incentives). The primary outcome will be 26-week biochemically confirmed point-prevalence abstinence. Analyses will examine the main and interactive effects of these 4 treatment components on 26- week and secondary abstinence outcomes to identify the components and combinations of components that significantly enhance success in quitting in this high-risk population. This experiment will identify especially effective combinations of highly scalable interventions of modest cost and few barriers that could be disseminated nationally to reduce socioeconomic disparities in smoking cessation among those seeking to quit. Additional analyses will: compare intervention components and promising component combinations in terms of cost-effectiveness, examine whether or not treatment engagement differs across component combinations, examine baseline variables that may moderate treatment response, and identify mediators of treatment effects on abstinence outcomes. Because delivery of the study interventions can be centralized through established and efficient services (WTQL and SmokefreeTXT), the potential for both scalable dissemination and cost-effectiveness of the interventions tested is great. The proposed research will help identify ways to reduce tobacco cessation disparities in L-I smokers who have tried to quit smoking but relapsed and may benefit from improved assistance. NARRATIVE This experiment will identify scalable interventions that can be delivered to low-income smokers, a high-risk group with high smoking and low smoking-cessation rates, by phone or through the mail to help them quit smoking after a recent failed attempt to quit smoking. This research will suggest ways to most efficiently combine convenient interventions to improve success in quitting among low-income smokers who bear a disproportionate burden of tobacco use, relative to higher-income smokers.",Optimizing remotely delivered Smoking Cessation Services for Low-Income Smokers,9527012,R01CA218156,"['Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' multimodality therapy ', ' combined treatment ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' Multimodality Treatment ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Engineering ', ' Incentives ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Target Populations ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' falls ', ' Uninsured ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Biochemical ', ' Individual ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Logistics ', ' Policies ', ' Smoker ', ' nicotine patch ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Smoking History ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Abstinence ', ' treatment effect ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' smoking intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' intervention effect ', ' smoking relapse ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' financial incentive ', ' follow up assessment ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Preventable cancer cause ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' evaluate cost-effectiveness ', ' cost-effectiveness evaluation ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' treatment services ', ' tobacco-free ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2018,572473,0.3020784884563009
"In Vivo Experience with NRT to Increase Adherence and Smoking Abstinence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking remains the leading cause of death and disability in the United States, resulting in death for 1 out of every 2 smokers. While smoking rates have declined to about 18% among the general population, smoking rates still remain disproportionately high among individuals in the criminal justice system (i.e., 70-80%). Despite this high rate of smoking, few interventions have been tested in this population. We were the first to investigate providing 12 weeks of bupropion to a sample of community corrections smokers and then randomizing them to either four sessions of smoking cessation counseling or no counseling to quit. No significant differences were found between our two groups, indicating no additional benefit from more intensive smoking cessation counseling. However, while only 5.8% were abstinent at the 6 month follow-up, abstinence rates were quadrupled among the minority of those who were adherent to medication. Developing interventions to increase medication adherence has been cited as the most important means to reducing disparities; however, the few interventions that have investigated increasing adherence have been psychoeducational only and have yielded poor results. But evidence from our previous work demonstrated that smokers who had previous experience using bupropion had higher subsequent cessation rates and this relationship was mediated by improved medication adherence. Thus, exposure to medication is very likely the critical factor in improving subsequent adherence. The current application proposes a randomized controlled trial to maximize medication adherence with this population of smokers by testing an In Vivo NRT experiential intervention. Participants randomized to the In Vivo intervention will try a nicotine patch in Session 1, try nicotine gum in Session 2, try combination nicotine replacement therapy (cNRT) in Session 3, and discuss any problems with use of cNRT for a quit attempt in Session 4. During each 30-minute session they will discuss their expectations for the medication as well as the In Vivo session effects of these medications on withdrawal symptomatology, including urge to smoke. Between sessions, participants will be given medication to use during that week to make practice quit attempts and to become familiar with the medication. Participants randomized to the control group will receive four 30-minute sessions of standard behavioral counseling. All participants will receive cNRT for 10 weeks. Follow-ups will occur up to six months post-intervention. Primary outcomes include 6 month point prevalence abstinence and abstinence across time as well as medication adherence. If successful, this intervention could provide an easily transportable, novel, and tailored intervention to increase medication adherence and improve smoking cessation rates among smokers in the criminal justice system to reduce health disparities and save lives. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Smoking is now concentrated in high risk and disadvantaged populations such as individuals in the criminal justice system. Novel intervention strategies have the potential to reduce the smoking rates and health disparities in a population with high rates of smoking but little access to traditional smoking cessation interventions.",In Vivo Experience with NRT to Increase Adherence and Smoking Abstinence,9501705,R01DA039678,"['Cause of Death ', ' Charge ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Goals ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Motivation ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Bupropion ', ' buproprion ', ' Wellbutrin ', ' Amfebutamone ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Mediating ', ' Withdrawal Symptom ', ' improved ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' nicotine patch ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' nicotine gum ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' Legal ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' in vivo ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' post intervention ', ' Instruction ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Expectancy ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Abstinence ', ' treatment effect ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' psychoeducational ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' successful intervention ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' symptomatology ', ' in vivo testing ', ' in vivo evaluation ', ' smoking abstinence ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2018,513930,0.19500105391465386
"A Text-Based Scheduled Reduction Intervention for Smokeless Tobacco Cessation Project Summary Smokeless tobacco (chew or dip) use remains prevalent in rural and medically underserved populations, leading to increased rates of tobacco-related cancers and chronic disease. Yet, underserved tobacco users who want to quit have access to few innovative interventions. This is a significant missed opportunity to address health disparities in this group. Scheduled Gradual Reduction (SGR) may be an effective intervention to help smokeless tobacco users quit. SGR addresses common cessation challenges faced by smokeless tobacco users including the strong cue-based component of use and strong withdrawal symptoms. The SGR method been minimally studied in this population of tobacco users and represents an innovative new direction in the field. SGR involves gradually tapering smokeless tobacco use through lengthening use intervals based on an individually tailored schedule. SGR helps smokeless tobacco users learn to refrain from chew/dips that are in environmental cues by following the schedule and gradually reducing their use. Delivering SGR interventions via text messaging is an innovative way to increase the reach of this cessation intervention in underserved populations. Therefore, we propose a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a SGR Intervention (SGR intervention plus text-based support messages) vs. control intervention (text-based support messages) in decreasing smokeless tobacco use. The SGR group (N=250) will receive a six-week SGR program and text-based support messages. The control group (N=250) will receive text-based support messages. The primary outcome will be self-report smokeless tobacco cessation at 6 months. We will also test the efficacy of the text-based SGR intervention compared to support messages only on changes in withdrawal, craving, self-regulation and restraint across the 6-month period and explore whether changes in withdrawal, craving, self-regulation and restraint mediate intervention effects on self- reported cessation at 6 months post-intervention. Results of this study can be disseminated broadly to help smokeless tobacco users quit with the ultimate goal of increasing access to efficacious cessation interventions and eliminating cancer health disparities. Project Narrative Available interventions for smokeless tobacco cessation have not targeted those most at risk and have not been easily disseminated too hard to reach populations. The proposed research will efficacy of a Scheduled Gradual Reduction intervention via SMS text messaging paired with text-based counseling messages. The results of this study can be easily disseminated to rural and medically underserved smokeless tobacco users to aid in cessation, thus helping to decrease tobacco related health disparities.",A Text-Based Scheduled Reduction Intervention for Smokeless Tobacco Cessation,9820108,R01CA242593,"['Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' Cues ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' chews ', ' chewed ', ' Chewing ', ' Mastication ', ' Medically Underserved Area ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Smokeless Tobacco ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Mediating ', ' Schedule ', ' Withdrawal Symptom ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' oral cavity cancer ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' base ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' restraint ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' smokeless tobacco cessation ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Tobacco-Related Carcinoma ', ' tobacco-related cancer ', ' tobacco-induced cancer ', ' Address ', ' Smokeless ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Text ', ' post intervention ', ' tobacco abstinence ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' medically underserved ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' trial design ', ' common symptom ', ' rural Americans ', ' rural underserved ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' texting ', ' short message service ', ' tobacco user ', ' tobacco cessation intervention ', ' tobacco cessation treatment ', ' smokeless tobacco user ', ' smokeless tobacco use ', ' ']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,368288,0.15336103831910192
"Modeling the public health impact of a national menthol cigarette ban. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States. More than one-third of smokers in the United States use menthol cigarettes. Menthol cigarettes are of particular public health concern because they make it easier for adolescents to initiate smoking and are more difficult to quit than non-menthol cigarettes. In addition, menthol cigarettes are disproportionately used by youth, low-income and racial/ethnic minority smokers. In 2011 the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC), a Congressionally mandated committee assembled to advise the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), reported that “removal of menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health in the United States.” Despite TPSAC’s conclusion, the FDA has not banned menthol cigarettes. Instead, the FDA has requested additional research to inform regulatory action. The objective of this project is to use microsimulation modeling to estimate the impact of a national menthol cigarette ban on tobacco use and tobacco-related disease, specifically cardiovascular disease (CVD) and tobacco-related cancers. This research would inform potential FDA regulatory action on menthol cigarettes. The project has three aims. Aim 1 identifies trajectories of cigarette use over time using longitudinal, nationally representative survey data. To achieve this aim, I will use Markov chains to compute transition probabilities of tobacco use behavior (frequency, intensity, flavor preference) over time. Aim 2 systematically reviews and meta-analyzes studies examining the effects of menthol cigarette bans on tobacco product use. This will be the first review to synthesize the literature on the impact of a menthol cigarette ban, providing critical information for microsimulation modeling. Aim 3 builds a microsimulation model of smoking and tobacco-related disease to estimate the impact of a national menthol cigarette ban on smoking, CVD, and tobacco-related cancers. I will establish parameters for the model using the best epidemiological evidence and conduct sensitivity analyses to test the validity of the model. Finally, I will estimate the change in smoking, CVD, and tobacco-related cancers that would occur in the total population and in specific socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups if a menthol cigarette ban were implemented. I hypothesize that a national menthol cigarette ban will reduce socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in smoking, CVD, and tobacco-related cancers. The career development award will help me achieve my goal of becoming an independent tobacco control and health disparities researcher. I will receive the training and mentorship needed to build an independent research program focused on the role tobacco control policy may play in improving the public’s health, in particular among groups that disproportionately suffer from smoking and tobacco-related disease. This award will culminate in an application for an R01 grant to expand upon my microsimulation model, comparing the impacts of additional tobacco control policies on smoking and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE More than one-third of smokers in the United States use menthol cigarettes.

"Geographic variation in the diverse tobacco retail environment and its impact on tobacco use disparities ABSTRACT Amid declining cigarette consumption, sales of non-cigarette tobacco products remain strong. Importantly, the diverse products available in the current tobacco marketplace pose different levels of harm to the user. Combustible products such as cigarettes and cigars are higher on the tobacco risk continuum than non- combustible products such as smokeless tobacco and electronic cigarettes (e-cigs). Conceivably, smokers who switch to a non-combustible product may reduce their risk of smoking-related disease. This behavior, however, is significantly more common among whites compared to blacks, who have the highest rates of combustible tobacco use of any racial or ethnic group. Indeed, cigarette smoking rates are declining faster among whites than blacks, potentially driven by e-cig uptake. Differential rates of quitting smoking by switching to e-cigs or other non-combustible products may exacerbate existing health disparities between whites and blacks. Although tobacco use is influenced by several individual, interpersonal, and societal factors, the retail environment is known to play a critical role in shaping smoking behaviors, particularly among racial minorities, whom the tobacco industry has historically exploited. Despite the growing popularity of e-cigs and other non- cigarette tobacco products, little is known about the promotion of these products at the point-of-sale. This project will examine how the retail of diverse tobacco products varies across the U.S. and the extent to which it is associated with use behaviors of community residents. Specifically, this study will 1) investigate the relationship between regional tobacco product sales, tobacco control policies, and community demographics using Nielsen market scanner data and census data, 2) document the association between the local tobacco retail environment and tobacco product use using geocoded data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and store audits, and 3) model smoking-related disparities attributed to changes in tobacco use behaviors using repeated cross-sectional NHIS data and longitudinal data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study. PROJECT NARRATIVE The current tobacco marketplace in the United States is more diverse than ever, with consumption of cigars, smokeless tobacco, and electronic cigarettes remaining strong amid declining cigarette consumption. This study will characterize the promotion of tobacco products with varying levels of harm across diverse communities to examine the potential impacts on smoking-related health disparities.",Geographic variation in the diverse tobacco retail environment and its impact on tobacco use disparities,9772148,DP5OD023064,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Advertising ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health behavior ', ' Literature ', ' Marketing ', ' Menthol ', ' New Jersey ', ' New York City ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Play ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sales ', ' Smoking ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Smokeless Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' Data Files ', ' uptake ', ' Shapes ', ' Smoker ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' tobacco company ', ' Pattern ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' metropolitan ', ' Cigarette ', ' Cigar ', ' Participant ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' Categories ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Societal Factors ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' discount ', ' cigarette advertising ', ' cigarette ads ', ' discounting ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' ecigarette ', ' ecig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' health data ', ' racial minority ', ' Time trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health ', ' electronic cigarette use ', ' ecigarette use ', ' ecig use ', ' e-cigarette use ', ' e-cig use ', ' cigarette smoke ', ' smokeless tobacco use ', ' tobacco smokers ', ' tobacco products ', ' ']",OD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,DP5,2019,400000,0.1592282652906704
"Impact of smoking and its cessation on systemic and airway immune activation PROJECT SUMMARY The exceedingly high rate of smoking and its substantial contribution to morbidity and mortality in the HIV- infected population despite effective ART makes smoking a major health risk in the HIV-infected population. The mechanism by which smoking exerts synergistic effects on HIV-induced immune dysfunction remains unclear. Our central hypothesis is that the persistent HIV-induced immune dysfunction leaves the lung exceeding vulnerable to further insults by smoking. Smoking further drives immune-mediate pathways, such as increase in oxidative stress and inflammation, to cause further local tissue destruction. The lung pathology can result in activation of latently infected alveolar macrophages in the lung to produce low level HIV viremia, and perpetuates this pro-inflammatory environment. Additionally, the chronic oxidative imbalance can cause not only local tissue damage but cellular DNA damage, which results in epithelial gene expression alterations. Aim 1 seeks to identify in a cross-sectional study of ART-treated HIV smokers chronic immune effects of smoking by evaluating for differences in cytokine profile and immune cell phenotype and ROS production of cells isolated in the airways and blood from HIV-infected never smokers. The relationships of these local and systemic immune perturbations with airway epithelial gene transcriptome and evidence of residual viremia will be evaluated to identify biological pathways by which smoking interacts with HIV immune dysfunction. In Aim 2 to further test the hypothesis we propose a proof-of-concept smoking cessation clinical study to assess the degree and nature of reversibility of lung damage among HIV smokers who achieve smoking cessation compared to those who continue to smoke. In this single site study, we will employ an intensive smoking cessation program to help study participants who are recruited from a large urban HIV-infected outpatient clinic where a unique integrated clinical research infrastructure is in place, achieve smoking cessation. Longitudinally samples will be collected pre-cessation and post-cessation from those who are able to achieve 10-week cessation from the lung and blood. We will evaluate the change in level of inflammation, immune activation and oxidative stress, and determine if these immune-mediate pathways are related to changes in HIV residual viremia and epithelial gene expression in the lung. Lastly, leveraging existing resources, we will compare these finding to those in uninfected smokers from banked samples collected already by our collaborator. This smoking cessation study in HIV-infected patients will be the first of its kind, with longitudinal specimen collection from both the lung and blood compartments, and utilizing translational approaches through collaborations with experts in virology, immunology, gene transcription and health disparity research. Understanding the relative contribution and pathways by which smoking interacts with immune activation and inflammation characteristic of chronic HIV disease will help guide development of therapeutic interventions to halt or reverse these pathological processes and ensuing clinical disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Smoking is a major and urgent public health issue for the HIV-infected population. Understanding the pathways by which smoking adversely interacts with HIV-induced immune dysfunction in the lung is critical to address this urgent public health concern. This study will address the immunological effects of smoking and subsequent cessation on lung inflammation and oxidative stress, and the ensuing change in HIV residual viremia in the lung compartment and airway epithelial gene expression alterations. Overall, the data from this study will fill a critical gap in the literature, offering potential mechanistic pathways by which smoking interacts with HIV- induced immune dysfunction in the lung and then systemically, and offer targets for future interventions.",Impact of smoking and its cessation on systemic and airway immune activation,9529613,R01DA042685,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Ambulatory Care Facilities ', ' Outpatient Clinics ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bacterial Pneumonia ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' DNA Injury ', ' DNA Damage ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Immunological System Dysfunction ', ' Immunological Dysfunction ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immunodeficiency and Immunosuppression Disorders ', ' Immune System and Related Disorders ', ' Immune System Dysfunction ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' Inflammation ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' disease of the lung ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' monocyte ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

Although multiple clinic and phone based smoking cessation treatments have been proven effective, most smoking cessation attempts are unaided and unsuccessful. Furthermore, smoking prevalence in socioeconomically disadvantaged adults is higher and cessation rates are lower than among adults with higher socioeconomic status. Previous research has indicated multiple causes of high cessation failure among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers including greater exposure to other smokers, and higher levels of stress and nicotine cravings. One recent study found that smartphone based ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) can be used to identify moments of high smoking lapse risk in the hours preceding a lapse. Specifically, EMA data were used to create a six-item smoking lapse risk estimator that identified 80% of all smoking lapses within 4 hours of the first lapse. This lapse risk estimator was included as a key component of the smartphone based Smart Treatment (Smart-T) smoking cessation app. The Smart-T app assesses risk for smoking lapse multiple times per day and automatically tailors treatment content based upon an individual's current risk for lapse and currently experienced lapse triggers. Smart-T includes other components (e.g., on demand tips for coping with cravings, stress, mood; benefits of quitting; one click call to the smoking cessation helpline; smoking cessation medication tips). The single arm Smart-T pilot study (N=59) indicated very promising 3 month biochemically verified cessation rates and analyses of EMA data indicated that tailored treatment content attenuated targeted lapse triggers. The proposed study (N=450) will compare the longer-term effects of the Smart-T smoking cessation app with the free and publically available NCI QuitGuide smoking cessation app (Aim 1). It is hypothesized that significantly more participants randomized to the Smart-T condition will be abstinent 26 weeks after a scheduled quit date than those assigned to the QuitGuide app. The second aim of the proposed study will determine if Smart-T messages that are tailored to address key smoking lapse risk variables in real- time (i.e., urge, stress, cigarette availability, cessation motivation) reduce participant ratings of these lapse risk variables compared with similar situations that do not receive this tailored content (QuitGuide group). Automated, tailored, low burden, and easily accessible interventions may be used to help socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers, a population with substantial barriers that have hampered the use of traditional smoking cessation treatments, to quit smoking. Thus, this intervention has the potential to deliver a significant public health impact to exactly those who need it most. PROJECT NARRATIVE Socioeconomically disadvantaged adults are more likely to smoke and less likely to successfully quit smoking than those of higher socioeconomic status, even when validated smoking cessation treatments are used. The proposed study will determine whether an automated smoking cessation application that tailors treatment content to the needs of socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers in real-time can reduce lapse risk and increase successful smoking cessation. By addressing lapse triggers as they arise, this type of dynamic, low burden, and always available smoking cessation app may reduce smoking lapse and thereby reduce morbidity and mortality in socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers.",Smartphone Based Smoking Cessation Intervention for Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Adults,9659157,R01CA221819,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Counseling ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Occupational Status ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' male ', ' Moods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Oklahoma ', ' Ownership ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' T-Groups ', ' Sensitivity Training Groups ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Work ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Schedule ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' Biochemical ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Measurement ', ' Native Americans ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Smoker ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' craving ', ' nicotine craving ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Abstinence ', ' tailored messaging ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' arm ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' smartphone Application ', ' iPhone Application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iOS application ', ' iOS app ', ' Smartphone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Android Application ', ' Android App ', ' smoking abstinence ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,R01,2019,543718,0.3108208120550932
"Gain-framed Messages and NRT Sampling to Promote Smoking Cessation in Lung Cancer Screening Programs PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lung cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in the U.S. In addition to primary prevention (tobacco control), secondary prevention through early detection with low-dose CT scans is recognized as a technique to identify earlier stage, more treatable lung cancers in high-risk patients. Evidence from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that lung cancer screening with low-dose CT scans for high risk individuals (>30 pack years of smoking, <15 yr quit-time, and 55-74 yrs of age) conferred a 20% reduction in mortality for those patients who received 3 annual low dose CT scans. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently issued a final recommendation for annual screening for lung cancer in these high risk individuals, and many insurers now cover the screening. The present study is thus timely and novel – we will investigate whether we can achieve higher rates of short- and long-term cessation in this high risk population. We will conduct a 2 x 2 (gain-framed intervention vs. unframed intervention, starter package of 2 weeks of nicotine patches and lozenges vs. no medication) study to evaluation methods to boost rates of smoking cessation for a high-risk group of smokers (N=616) with varying levels of motivation across 2 study sites (MUSC, Yale). Participants will be identified through the MUSC and Yale lung cancer screening programs at both sites. Randomization will be stratified by study site and level of motivation. The primary hypothesis is that rates of smoking cessation will be significantly higher at 6-months after lung screening for the smoking cessation strategy involving a gain-framed intervention + 2 weeks of nicotine patches and lozenges compared to a strategy of an unframed behavioral intervention + no medication. Our secondary hypothesis is that rates of smoking cessation will be higher for the gain-framed intervention group vs. the unframed intervention group and the starter package of 2 weeks of nicotine patches and lozenges group vs. the no medication group. On an exploratory basis we will also examine mediators and moderators of treatment. We hypothesize that changes in self-efficacy, smoking cessation outcome expectancy, familiarization with NRT, motivation, and autonomy will act as mechanisms for the smoking cessation effects (i.e., will act as mediators of treatment). We also hypothesize that lung screening findings (e.g., presence of a nodule, cancer, etc), nicotine dependence, and health disparities will modify treatment response (i.e., will act as baseline moderators of treatment). This project is designed to be translational (in that it can be transferable from our controlled efficacy study to other lung screening programs at other institutions) as all of our media will be digital files ready for sharing, the procedures for NRT sampling will be easily copied, and the print materials can be provided as fillable templates for personalization. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recently approved annual lung cancer screening as a benefit for individuals: (1) ages 55-77 years old; (2) asymptomatic (no signs of lung cancer illness); (3) tobacco smoking history of at least 30 pack-years; and (4) report current smoking or quit smoking within the past 15 years. While one might hypothesize that simply having a CT scan may promote cessation, evidence suggests that having a scan increases quit rates only slightly, if there is any increase at all. Most patients presenting for screening will have variable motivation to quit smoking, with many of them lacking motivation to quit. Studying smoking cessation interventions in the context of lung cancer screening has the potential to improve cessation rates for this high-risk group of smokers.",Gain-framed Messages and NRT Sampling to Promote Smoking Cessation in Lung Cancer Screening Programs,9539986,R01CA207229,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Elements ', ' Insurers ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Nodule ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Recommendation ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' Smoking ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' computerized tomography ', ' computerized axial tomography ', ' computed axial tomography ', ' catscan ', ' Xray Computed Tomography ', ' X-Ray Computerized Tomography ', ' X-Ray CAT Scan ', ' Tomodensitometry ', ' EMI scan ', ' Computed Tomography ', ' CT scan ', ' CT imaging ', ' CT X Ray ', ' CAT scan ', ' X-Ray Computed Tomography ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' lung cancer screening ', ' lung cancer early detection ', ' Smoker ', ' nicotine patch ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' programs ', ' Scanning ', ' Techniques ', ' Tobacco smoking behavior ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' Country ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' low-dose spiral CT ', ' low-dose helical computed tomography ', ' low-dose CT ', ' low dose computed tomography ', ' Smoking History ', ' beneficiary ', ' tobacco control ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Expectancy ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' treatment effect ', ' high risk ', ' group intervention ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' screening ', ' treatment group ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' efficacy study ', ' patient screening ', ' screening program ', ' routine screening ', ' annual screening ', ' ']",NCI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2019,587099,0.2175451531997429
"Randomized Trial of an Innovative Smartphone Intervention for Smoking Cessation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is tremendous need for smoking cessation intervention technologies with strong potential population-level impact at the lowest possible cost. That potential can be found in the newest technological innovation in quit smoking interventions: smartphone-based smoking cessation software applications (""apps""). There are over 400 smoking cessation apps, which were downloaded in the United States 3.2 million times during the two-year period 2012 to 2013. No trials of any app's effectiveness for general adult cessation have been published and no NIH-funded cessation intervention trials are in progress-despite the fact this is a high priority NIH funding topic. The enormous usage of smoking cessation apps contrasted with their unknown effectiveness creates a serious scientific gap that could stifle their population-level impact.  Research on US Clinical Practice Guidelines (USCPG) apps begins to address that research gap. But only following the USCPG has had limitations in other modalities of delivery. An approach, called Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), addresses these limitations with both innovative intervention content and highly promising results from six published trials. ACT's innovation is its dual focus on increasing willingness to experience physical cravings, emotions, and thoughts that cue smoking while making values-guided committed behavior changes. We recently developed the first ACT app for smoking cessation, called ""SmartQuit,"" and tested it in a pilot randomized controlled trial (N  196), comparing it with an app that follows USCPG (National Cancer Institute's ""QuitGuide""). Results showed that SmartQuit had: (1) higher participant engagement and satisfaction than QuitGuide, (3) higher levels of acceptance of cravings than QuitGuide, and (3) descriptively higher quit rates (albeit non-significant) than QuitGuide at the two-month follow-up.  Building on these promising results, we propose a fully-powered three-arm randomized controlled trial (n = 811 per arm) that compares SmartQuit to QuitGuide and each app to the NCI's Clearing the Air booklet, which follows the USCPG, to definitively determine whether (1) an USCPG app is more efficacious than a USCPG self-help booklet; (2) an ACT app is more efficacious than a USCPG booklet; (3) an ACT app is more efficacious than a USCPG app.  As millions of people are choosing smartphone apps to help them quit smoking, this innovative study shows exciting promise for improving the success rates of quit smoking apps and thereby lowering healthcare costs and reducing premature tobacco-related deaths. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over the two-year period of 2012-2013, smartphone applications for smoking cessation reached 3.2 million people in the United States and their reach is climbing rapidly. This randomized trial will definitively test a smartphone application-delivered Acceptance & Commitment Therapy intervention for adult smoking cessation.

"Smoke-free Air Coalitions in Georgia and Armenia: A Community Randomized Trial SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Public health efforts in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) could be catalyzed by bolstering ways to optimally leverage local talents and resources, such as civil society. Developing effective models for aligning civil society and governmental public health at the local level in LMICs has the potential to impact a range of chronic diseases and risk factors, including tobacco. Local coalitions have been a dominant strategy in tobacco control in the US, with well-documented success in establishing smoke-free policies specifically. However, this approach has not been widely leveraged or well-studied in LMICs or those with less democratic traditions than the US. Instead, in many LMICs, smoke-free policy progress is largely initiated at the national level. Parallel civil society movements at the local level may be needed to build support for and compliance with policies. Given their sociopolitical histories and high tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) rates, Georgia (GE) and Armenia (AM) are two strategic settings for the proposed work. The smoking prevalence is 57.7% and 52.3% in men (6th and 11th highest in the world) and 5.7% and 1.5% in women, respectively. Moreover, our findings indicate extremely high rates of SHSe. However, we also documented high receptivity to public smoke-free policies despite high use rates, particularly in worksites and restaurants. This proposal is a well-justified extension of the literature and our prior work. We will build the capacity of GE and AM researchers to conduct high-quality mixed methods tobacco research and test the Community Coalition Action Theory as a framework for impacting local community-driven policy change. Researchers from the GE National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) and AM National Institute of Health (NIH) will collaborate with Emory to execute the proposed research, train tobacco control researchers within their organizations and partnering universities, and train practitioners within local communities to build local coalitions for tobacco control policy. We aim to: 1) conduct a matched-pair community randomized controlled trial in 28 municipalities in GE and AM to examine the impact of local coalitions promoting the adoption of smoke-free policies in worksites and restaurants, with the primary outcome of changes in SHSe over time; 2) assess how community context and coalition factors influence adoption of organizational and municipal smoke-free policies to provide an evidence- base for public health practice; 3) disseminate research findings regarding both the effectiveness and the process of establishing and maintaining coalitions, and consequently increasing smoke-free policies and reducing SHSe, to key stakeholders in GE and AM; and 4) capitalize on the proposed research and dissemination opportunities to build tobacco control research capacity within the GE NCDC, AM NIH, and partnering universities, as well as practice capacity within local public health centers and their civil society partners. Ultimately, the activities outlined in this proposal will serve as a catalyst for future action-oriented science and evidence-based practice to support tobacco control progress in this region more broadly. PROJECT NARRATIVE Developing effective models for aligning civil society and governmental public health at the local level in LMICs has the potential to impact a range of chronic diseases and risk factors, including tobacco. In this proposal, we will partner with the national public health agencies in Georgia and Armenia – two countries with extremely high rates of smoking and secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) and with sociopolitical histories not conducive to local activism; we will examine: 1) the impact of local coalitions promoting smoke-free policies in worksites and restaurants on SHSe in these challenging environments and 2) how community context and coalition factors influence adoption of organizational and municipal smoke-free policies. We will capitalize on the proposed research to build tobacco control research capacity in our partnering institutions, as well as practice capacity within local communities; results will be disseminated in order to serve as a catalyst for future action- oriented science and evidence-based practice to support tobacco control progress in this region.",Smoke-free Air Coalitions in Georgia and Armenia: A Community Randomized Trial,9734197,R01TW010664,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Air ', ' Armenia ', ' Attention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Future ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Health Resources ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Influentials ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Talents ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Policies ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Exposure to ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Municipalities ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' research dissemination ', ' research data dissemination ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Advocate ', ' Research Training ', ' Tobacco Control Research ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' tobacco control ', ' Population ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' civil society ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' smoke-free policy ', ' environmental tobacco smoke exposure ', ' secondhand smoke exposure ', ' second hand smoke exposure ', ' exposure to tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to SHS ', ' exposure to ETS ', ' Passive Smoke Exposure ', ' model building ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' sex disparity ', ' disparities in sex ', ' Infrastructure ', ' health goals ', ' ']",FIC,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,298120,0.10357744783394394
"Optimizing remotely delivered Smoking Cessation Services for Low-Income Smokers ABSTRACT Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of cancer and many other deadly diseases, and the burden of tobacco use is greatest among those with limited socioeconomic resources. Although we have driven down population smoking rates, and with them, cancer rates, roughly 28% of the socioeconomically disadvantaged still smoke regularly. Low-income (L-I) smokers also develop cancer at higher rates and struggle more to quit than do higher-income smokers. These disparities in tobacco use and its burdens must be addressed. Highly effective cessation treatment services that can be delivered remotely, flexibly, and conveniently with few cost or logistical barriers have the potential to achieve this aim. Tobacco quitline and SmokefreeTXT services are such treatment resources with demonstrated attractiveness and reach among L-I smokers. The current proposal will use an efficient factorial design to evaluate 4 smoking cessation interventions with vast reach and dissemination potential. The target population will be N=1,408 Medicaid-eligible or uninsured smokers who have recently enrolled in the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line (WTQL), but who report continued smoking 4- months following engagement in standard WTQL services. These treatment non-responders will be invited to participate in an experiment that will randomize them to 1 of 2 levels of each of the following 4 factors in a 2X2X2X2 design: WTQL counseling intensity (1 session vs. 4 sessions), medication intensity (2-week nicotine patch monotherapy vs. 4-week nicotine patch and lozenge combination therapy), a supportive text messaging program (SmokefreeTXT vs. none), and financial incentives (rewards of up to $150 for treatment engagement vs. no treatment incentives). The primary outcome will be 26-week biochemically confirmed point-prevalence abstinence. Analyses will examine the main and interactive effects of these 4 treatment components on 26- week and secondary abstinence outcomes to identify the components and combinations of components that significantly enhance success in quitting in this high-risk population. This experiment will identify especially effective combinations of highly scalable interventions of modest cost and few barriers that could be disseminated nationally to reduce socioeconomic disparities in smoking cessation among those seeking to quit. Additional analyses will: compare intervention components and promising component combinations in terms of cost-effectiveness, examine whether or not treatment engagement differs across component combinations, examine baseline variables that may moderate treatment response, and identify mediators of treatment effects on abstinence outcomes. Because delivery of the study interventions can be centralized through established and efficient services (WTQL and SmokefreeTXT), the potential for both scalable dissemination and cost-effectiveness of the interventions tested is great. The proposed research will help identify ways to reduce tobacco cessation disparities in L-I smokers who have tried to quit smoking but relapsed and may benefit from improved assistance. NARRATIVE This experiment will identify scalable interventions that can be delivered to low-income smokers, a high-risk group with high smoking and low smoking-cessation rates, by phone or through the mail to help them quit smoking after a recent failed attempt to quit smoking. This research will suggest ways to most efficiently combine convenient interventions to improve success in quitting among low-income smokers who bear a disproportionate burden of tobacco use, relative to higher-income smokers.",Optimizing remotely delivered Smoking Cessation Services for Low-Income Smokers,9749070,R01CA218156,"['Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' combined treatment ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Engineering ', ' Incentives ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Target Populations ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' falls ', ' Uninsured ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Biochemical ', ' Individual ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Logistics ', ' Policies ', ' Smoker ', ' nicotine patch ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Smoking History ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Text ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' quitline ', ' quit line ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Abstinence ', ' treatment effect ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' smoking intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' intervention effect ', ' smoking relapse ', ' financial incentive ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' follow up assessment ', ' followup assessment ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Preventable cancer cause ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' cost-effectiveness evaluation ', ' evaluate cost-effectiveness ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' texting ', ' short message service ', ' treatment services ', ' tobacco-free ', ' preservation ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,575973,0.3020784884563009
"Biomarker of Lung Disease in African Americans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the 3rd leading cause of death in the US1,2. Although COPD occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develops chronic airflow limitation or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). Identification molecular profiles from current or former smokers who are likely to progress is a crucial step in understanding the pathogenesis of COPD and emphysema. There are very few publications that describe COPD biomarkers in large, well phenotyped cohorts that include a significant number of African Americans. This study will leverage large NIH- supported cohorts (COPDGene, SPIROMICS, and MESA-Lung) that have large number of well-characterized African Americans subjects with or at risk for COPD. Since the subjects have stored plasma and have been followed for 7-10 years with extensive clinical, physiologic, and imaging, we can very cost-effectively apply a proteomic approach. Furthermore, because the cohorts have other valuable Omics data, we can integrate the proteomic findings with whole genome sequencing and other advanced molecular studies such as genomics. This knowledge may help develop novel diagnostic tests and therapies for early prevention and treatment of COPD and will identify any markers that are specific to smoking-related lung disease in African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third most common cause of death in the United States. The major risk factor is smoking; however, most smokers do not develop COPD and the factors that identify who goes from normal to abnormal lung function are unknown. Most of the studies on COPD have been in non-Hispanic Whites and Asians and there are very few studies, which address risk factors and molecular pathogenesis in African Americans. This proposal will use three existing NHLBI cohorts to identify blood signatures that can identify who will be at risk for developing smoking related lung disease in African Americans.

"Culturally sensitive, evidence-based, Spanish language mobile app for smoking cessation for Latino cigarette smokers Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of mortality in the U.S., resulting in over 480,000 deaths every year and costing more than $300 billion in loss of productivity. Smoking is also the leading cause of cancer and of deaths from cancer. Although the prevalence of smoking has declined over the past 50 years, large disparities in tobacco use remain across a number of groups. Latino/a smokers represent a major health disparity population in the U.S. and their unique healthcare needs are not being adequately addressed. Major contributing factors to smoking among Latinos in the U.S. include increased exposure to multiple stressors associated with crime and unemployment, elevated rates of anxiety/depression, discrimination, lack of Spanish-language treatments, and limited access to quality care. Although Latino smokers tend to smoke at lower rates than non-Latino Whites and are more likely than non-Latino White smokers to attempt cessation, they are less likely to receive in-person evidence-based care and more apt to fail in their quit attempts.  Mobile technologies offer an ideal strategy to meet the widespread treatment needs of U.S. Latino/a smokers, as U.S. population data suggests that Latinos adopt smartphones at a rate higher than any other demographic group. However, there are currently no Spanish language mobile apps for Latino smokers that are psychosocial in nature and evidence-based for Latino smokers who often struggle with elevated rates of anxiety/depression and chronic exposure to life stressors (e.g., discrimination, acculturation). One cognitive- behavior therapy that is an ideal fit for this need and is particularly amenable to a mobile platform is anxiety sensitivity reduction-based smoking cessation. Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is a cognitive construct reflecting a disproportionate fear of anxiety-related sensations. Individuals with high AS interpret stress-related sensations (e.g., heart palpitations) as personally harmful or dangerous. There is a substantial literature linking AS to the development of anxiety and depressive disorders, PTSD, and substance use disorders. Moreover, AS is related to increased risk for smoking cessation failure and more severe withdrawal craving among smokers, including Latinos. Reducing AS prior to a quit attempt via cognitive restructuring and interoceptive exposure is related to increased success in quitting. Our team has previously adapted AS reduction for smoking in Spanish and results from this work suggest that a Spanish-language version of AS reduction for smoking cessation is effective for increasing smoking cessation success and reducing negative mood that impairs quit attempts.  The aims of this Phase I application are to employ user centered design to develop and test the acceptability and efficacy of a Spanish language, mobile app, Impacto, which will incorporate proven AS reduction intervention strategies vs. a generic, Spanish language control smoking cessation app (Dejar de Fumar Asistente) in a small randomized controlled trial of adult Latino smokers. We expect that this project will result in a prototype of Impacto, whose clinical efficacy can then be tested in a fully-powered, Phase II randomized controlled trial. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While the prevalence of cigarette smoking has declined over the past 50 years, large disparities in tobacco use remain across a number of groups. Latino/a smokers represent a major health disparity population in the U.S. and their unique healthcare needs are not being adequately addressed. Anxiety sensitivity (AS) is a cognitive construct reflecting a disproportionate fear of anxiety-related sensations and is related to increased risk for smoking cessation failure and more severe withdrawal craving among smokers, including Latinos. The proposed study will develop and test the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a Spanish language, mobile phone application, named Impacto, which will incorporate proven AS reduction strategies, and thus will address a significant public health priority; the development of new, innovative and efficacious approaches to smoking cessation treatment for Latino/a

"Ovarian Hormones Effect on Smoking Behavior ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco smoking is a leading cause of preventable death and disability in the U.S. Although women compared to men are at a greater risk of smoking-related disease morbidity and mortality, research suggests they may smoke for different reasons than men and have a harder time quitting than men. Research identifying female-specific factors underlying addiction is critical for: (a) addressing sex-related health disparities; (b) informing female-specific treatments; and (c) discovering addiction processes that are overrepresented among females yet applicable to both sexes. Ovarian hormones represent a female specific factor implicate in the maintenance of nicotine addiction and success following a quit attempt. This proposal aims to advance this line of research by combining ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with daily hormonal sampling across an entire menstrual cycle to further examine the patterns and mechanisms of ovarian hormone variation effects on smoking in women in real time. The use of prospective daily recordings and hormonal sampling will allow us to test whether smoking will be higher on days with high estrogen and lower on days with high progesterone (Aim 1), that women with greater estrogen to progesterone ratios compared to women with lower estrogen to progesterone ratios across the entire menstrual cycle will smoke more and be more nicotine dependent (Aim 2), and that days with higher estrogen will be marked by greater nicotine reward and worse cognitive control, which will mediate relations between higher estrogen and increased smoking (Aim 3). Secondary aims will explore variability of hormonal effects across the menstrual cycle (Aim 4). As the first comprehensive study investigating daily changes in ovarian hormones, drug reward, cognitive control, and smoking behavior, this project will pave the way for a program of research involving more intensive laboratory and field-based studies of psychoneuroendocrinological underpinnings of smoking in women.  Through expert mentoring, directed readings, formal coursework and seminars, onsite training, attending national scientific meetings, manuscript and grant preparation, mentorship of students in the USC Health, Emotion, and Addiction Laboratory, and the completion of the proposed investigation expertise will be gained in: (a) Naturalistic field assessment of nicotine addiction; (b) EMA design and implementation; and (c) Use of advanced statistical methodology to test the aims outlined by the project. Thus, by the end of the proposed training period, the applicant will be uniquely positioned to run an independent interdisciplinary line of research incorporating both lab and field based studies in investigating female specific factors in addiction. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clarifying the role of ovarian hormones on smoking may aid cessation treatment in women and could provide further evidence for the use of hormone-based medications for smoking cessation in both sexes.

"Competency-based training to advance clinical proficiencies and reduce disparities in the treatment of tobacco dependence Despite remarkable decreases in tobacco use, the benefits of tobacco control efforts are not equitably distributed. Tobacco-related disparities include a higher prevalence of daily smoking, lower rates of quitting, poorer responses to standard evidence-based treatments, less access to evidence-based treatments, variation in health care providers' delivery of tobacco treatment, and an increased burden of tobacco-related cancers and other tobacco-related diseases. Many tobacco users belong to more than one disparate group. Addressing these disparities is a high priority for cancer and tobacco control efforts. Critical barriers to reducing tobacco- related disparities include a tobacco treatment workforce unprepared to understand, assess, and treat tobacco users from disparate groups; knowledge deficits regarding the nature and impact of tobacco-related disparities; known research-to-practice gaps in the clinical proficiencies needed to treat tobacco use among disparate groups more effectively; and a unidimensional or essentialist conceptualization of the determinants that contribute to these inequities. These barriers prevent the development of personalized, relevant comprehensive tobacco treatment plans for these individuals. A unified, multidisciplinary competency-based curriculum developed by tobacco treatment disparities research, practice, and training experts and disseminated nationally would represent significant progress toward addressing these barriers. The goal of this project is to develop an innovative, competency-based Tobacco Use Treatment among Disparate Populations (TUT-DP) Training Module that will advance the proficiencies of the clinical and research workforce to meet the biomedical, behavioral, and clinical needs of groups that experience tobacco-related disparities. Experts in the field from multiple disciplines perceive a need for this resource. Among the innovative aspects of this project is the use of Intersectionality to integrate models of disparities and develop guiding principles for understanding biopsychosocial influences that produce tobacco-related disparities across disparate populations. The specific aims are: Aim One: Using a multidisciplinary team of tobacco research, practice, and training experts and an iterative process, develop a competency-based, highly disseminable TUT-DP Training Module that includes train-the-trainer resources, slides, and problem-based and experiential learning activities supported by high- quality recorded demonstration and trigger videos, a training manual, and learner evaluation instruments. Aim Two: Pilot test and refine the TUT-DP Training Module with trainers and learners from diverse professional backgrounds. Aim Three: Disseminate the TUT-DP Training Module broadly among tobacco treatment training programs and relevant professional organizations. This project is expected to have a sustained and powerful impact on the field by disseminating an innovative and engaging multidisciplinary training experience that advances clinical proficiencies and serves as an essential tool for clinical training in tobacco disparities. We will seek additional funding through the appropriate mechanism to examine the effectiveness of the TUT-DP Training Module in the next phase of this cancer education work. Project Narrative The Tobacco Use Treatment among Disparate Populations (TUT-DP) Training Module will guide the education and training of a multidisciplinary clinical workforce in how to effectively identify, assess, and treat tobacco use among disparate groups in many health care and public health settings. The TUT-DP Training Module is expected to have a sustained and significant impact on public health by disseminating an innovative and engaging training experience and serving as an essential tool for research in tobacco disparities clinical training.",Competency-based training to advance clinical proficiencies and reduce disparities in the treatment of tobacco dependence,9792039,R25CA233416,"['Accreditation ', ' Awareness ', ' Charge ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Empathy ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Manuals ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Minority Groups ', ' professional society ', ' professional membership ', ' professional association ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Smoking ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' tobacco dependent ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Veterans ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Competence ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' physical handicap ', ' physical disability ', ' Physically Disabled ', ' Physically Handicapped ', ' Trainers Training ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Active Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Nature ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Slide ', ' Intellectual functioning disability ', ' intellectual and developmental disability ', ' Intellectual limitation ', ' Intellectual disability ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' treatment planning ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' cancer education ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Tobacco-Related Carcinoma ', ' tobacco-related cancer ', ' tobacco-induced cancer ', ' Address ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' tobacco abstinence ', ' tobacco control ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' research to practice ', ' research into practice ', ' sexual minority ', ' curriculum development ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' education research ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' intersectionality ', ' tobacco user ', ' ']",NCI,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R25,2019,164000,0.1483725326749785
"In Vivo Experience with NRT to Increase Adherence and Smoking Abstinence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking remains the leading cause of death and disability in the United States, resulting in death for 1 out of every 2 smokers. While smoking rates have declined to about 18% among the general population, smoking rates still remain disproportionately high among individuals in the criminal justice system (i.e., 70-80%). Despite this high rate of smoking, few interventions have been tested in this population. We were the first to investigate providing 12 weeks of bupropion to a sample of community corrections smokers and then randomizing them to either four sessions of smoking cessation counseling or no counseling to quit. No significant differences were found between our two groups, indicating no additional benefit from more intensive smoking cessation counseling. However, while only 5.8% were abstinent at the 6 month follow-up, abstinence rates were quadrupled among the minority of those who were adherent to medication. Developing interventions to increase medication adherence has been cited as the most important means to reducing disparities; however, the few interventions that have investigated increasing adherence have been psychoeducational only and have yielded poor results. But evidence from our previous work demonstrated that smokers who had previous experience using bupropion had higher subsequent cessation rates and this relationship was mediated by improved medication adherence. Thus, exposure to medication is very likely the critical factor in improving subsequent adherence. The current application proposes a randomized controlled trial to maximize medication adherence with this population of smokers by testing an In Vivo NRT experiential intervention. Participants randomized to the In Vivo intervention will try a nicotine patch in Session 1, try nicotine gum in Session 2, try combination nicotine replacement therapy (cNRT) in Session 3, and discuss any problems with use of cNRT for a quit attempt in Session 4. During each 30-minute session they will discuss their expectations for the medication as well as the In Vivo session effects of these medications on withdrawal symptomatology, including urge to smoke. Between sessions, participants will be given medication to use during that week to make practice quit attempts and to become familiar with the medication. Participants randomized to the control group will receive four 30-minute sessions of standard behavioral counseling. All participants will receive cNRT for 10 weeks. Follow-ups will occur up to six months post-intervention. Primary outcomes include 6 month point prevalence abstinence and abstinence across time as well as medication adherence.

"Econometric Analysis of Cigarette Purchases on Native American Reservations PROJECT SUMMARY Cigarette taxation is a widely used tobacco control policy that can improve public health by discouraging smoking. Due to their legal status, Native American reservations (NARs) and First Nations reserves are important sources of lower- or un-taxed cigarettes in the U.S. and Canada. In some geographic areas and times, the prevalence of NAR purchases reaches over 40%. Data from the 2010-11 Tobacco Use Supplements to the Current Population Survey implies that 5.6 million smokers live in 7 states where the prevalence of NAR purchases is between 15% and 35%. The policy trend towards higher cigarette taxes means that tax avoidance through NARs is likely to grow substantially. The 2014 Surgeon General's Report, the CDC (2015), and the National Research Council Institute of Medicine (2015) stress the public health significance of, and need for additional research into, contraband cigarette markets including NARs. The project's broad goal is to study the impact of NAR cigarette availability on smoking, birth outcomes, and health disparities. Aim 1 is to conduct a quasi-experimental analysis of the impact of the availability of NAR cigarettes on adult smoking participation. We will analyze individual-level data on smoking from multiple large U.S. and Canada secondary data sets. Our econometric specification will test 4 hypotheses: 1) that state cigarette excise taxes reduce adult smoking; 2) that the impact of taxes on smoking varies depending upon the availability of NAR cigarettes; 3) that the availability of NAR cigarettes has a causal treatment effect to increase smoking; and 4) that the impacts of taxes and NAR cigarette availability on adult smoking varies with socioeconomic status. Aim 2 is to conduct a quasi-experimental analysis of the impact of the availability of NAR cigarettes on youth smoking participation, cigarettes smoked per day, and smoking initiation. We will test the 4 hypotheses listed under Aim 1 in the context of youth smoking. Aim 3 is to conduct a quasi-experimental analysis of the impact of the availability of NAR cigarettes on health outcomes and health disparities. We will test the 4 hypotheses listed under Aim 1 in the context of health outcomes. Aim 4 is to conduct a quasi-experimental analysis of the indirect effects of the availability of reservation cigarettes on the prices charged by off-reservation cigarette retailers. Our econometric analysis will test whether cigarette sales on nearby NARs is associated with lower cigarette prices and sales off-reservation. Aim 5 is to conduct a more structural econometric analysis of the impact of the availability of NAR cigarettes on individuals' joint decisions about smoking, purchase location, and cigarette price paid. We will estimate a structural endogenous switching regression model. The estimated model will directly estimate key mechanisms or links in the chain of causality: the impact of taxes and distance on the probability of NAR purchases; and the impact of NAR purchases on cigarette prices paid. X Cigarette taxation is a widely used tobacco control policy that can improve public health by discouraging smoking. Due to their special legal status, Native American reservations are an important source of un-taxed cigarettes. Beyond the significance for public health in general, this source of un-taxed cigarettes is especially significant for health disparities. This project proposes econometric studies of the impact of taxes and the availability of untaxed cigarettes on adult smoking, youth smoking, infant health, maternal smoking, and health disparities.

"Small Financial Incentives to Promote Smoking Cessation in Safety Net Hospital Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. Although the prevalence of smoking has declined to 18.1 percent among U.S. adults, 27.9 percent of those living in poverty report current smoking. Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking cessation. There is mounting evidence that offering incentives for abstinence (i.e., Contingency Management [CM]) may be an effective approach for promoting short-term smoking cessation, though few studies have demonstrated longer-term effectiveness. In addition, little attention has been paid to socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers specifically (e.g., safety- net hospital populations) in CM intervention studies. Our preliminary work indicates that offering small escalating financial incentives for smoking abstinence dramatically increases short-term cessation rates among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers when incentives are included as an adjunct to standard clinic- based smoking cessation treatment. However, additional work is needed to evaluate the influence of this CM approach in the longer-term with a rigorous and adequately powered trial. Thus, the aims of the proposed study are to: 1) evaluate the longer-term impact of an adjunctive, low-cost CM intervention (relative to usual care) on smoking abstinence rates among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals participating in a safety-net hospital smoking cessation program, and 2) identify treatment mechanisms and contextual factors associated with cessation outcomes among intervention participants using both traditional and ecological momentary assessment approaches. Participants seeking smoking cessation treatment at an urban safety net hospital (N = 320) will be randomly assigned to 1) usual care (UC; n = 160) or 2) UC plus financial incentives for biochemically-confirmed abstinence (CM; n = 160). Those randomized to the CM intervention will have the opportunity to earn small gift cards for biochemically-verified abstinence through 12 weeks post-quit. Specifically, participants may earn $20 for abstinence on the quit date, and this amount will increase by $5 with each successive abstinent visit through 4 weeks post-quit ($150 total). Participants may additionally earn $50 gift cards for abstinence at 8 and 12 weeks post-quit. Biochemically-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks post-quit (longer-term abstinence) will be the primary outcome variable, though smoking status will be assessed at all visits. We also hope to gain a better understanding of CM treatment mechanisms and to identify other factors that directly influence cessation via traditional questionnaire and smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment approaches. Smartphone technology allows for ""real-time"" data collection to more accurately capture important cessation-related variables, and will be used to deliver gain-framed messages to support and strengthen the CM intervention. Findings will provide insight about new treatment targets for intervention research, and will demonstrate an effective, inexpensive, and easily implementable means by which to improve longer-term smoking cessation rates among economically disadvantaged smokers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking cessation.

"Smartphone Based Smoking Cessation Intervention for Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Adults PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disease in the United States. Although multiple clinic and phone based smoking cessation treatments have been proven effective, most smoking cessation attempts are unaided and unsuccessful. Furthermore, smoking prevalence in socioeconomically disadvantaged adults is higher and cessation rates are lower than among adults with higher socioeconomic status. Previous research has indicated multiple causes of high cessation failure among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers including greater exposure to other smokers, and higher levels of stress and nicotine cravings. One recent study found that smartphone based ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) can be used to identify moments of high smoking lapse risk in the hours preceding a lapse. Specifically, EMA data were used to create a six-item smoking lapse risk estimator that identified 80% of all smoking lapses within 4 hours of the first lapse. This lapse risk estimator was included as a key component of the smartphone based Smart Treatment (Smart-T) smoking cessation app. The Smart-T app assesses risk for smoking lapse multiple times per day and automatically tailors treatment content based upon an individual's current risk for lapse and currently experienced lapse triggers. Smart-T includes other components (e.g., on demand tips for coping with cravings, stress, mood; benefits of quitting; one click call to the smoking cessation helpline; smoking cessation medication tips). The single arm Smart-T pilot study (N=59) indicated very promising 3 month biochemically verified cessation rates and analyses of EMA data indicated that tailored treatment content attenuated targeted lapse triggers. The proposed study (N=450) will compare the longer-term effects of the Smart-T smoking cessation app with the free and publically available NCI QuitGuide smoking cessation app (Aim 1). It is hypothesized that significantly more participants randomized to the Smart-T condition will be abstinent 26 weeks after a scheduled quit date than those assigned to the QuitGuide app. The second aim of the proposed study will determine if Smart-T messages that are tailored to address key smoking lapse risk variables in real- time (i.e., urge, stress, cigarette availability, cessation motivation) reduce participant ratings of these lapse risk variables compared with similar situations that do not receive this tailored content (QuitGuide group). Automated, tailored, low burden, and easily accessible interventions may be used to help socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers, a population with substantial barriers that have hampered the use of traditional smoking cessation treatments, to quit smoking. Thus, this intervention has the potential to deliver a significant public health impact to exactly those who need it most. PROJECT NARRATIVE Socioeconomically disadvantaged adults are more likely to smoke and less likely to successfully quit smoking than those of higher socioeconomic status, even when validated smoking cessation treatments are used. The proposed study will determine whether an automated smoking cessation application that tailors treatment content to the needs of socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers in real-time can reduce lapse risk and increase successful smoking cessation. By addressing lapse triggers as they arise, this type of dynamic, low burden, and always available smoking cessation app may reduce smoking lapse and thereby reduce morbidity and mortality in socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers.",Smartphone Based Smoking Cessation Intervention for Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Adults,9989478,R01CA221819,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Algorithms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Counseling ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Occupational Status ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' male ', ' Moods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Oklahoma ', ' Ownership ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' T-Groups ', ' Sensitivity Training Groups ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Work ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Schedule ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' Biochemical ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Measurement ', ' Native Americans ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Smoker ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' craving ', ' nicotine craving ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Abstinence ', ' tailored messaging ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' arm ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' smartphone Application ', ' iPhone Application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iOS application ', ' iOS app ', ' Smartphone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Android Application ', ' Android App ', ' smoking abstinence ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,R01,2019,109741,0.3108208120550932
"Assessing Telephone All Nations Breath of Life for Efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY AI have the highest smoking rates of all major ethnic groups in the US, at 31.8%, nearly double that of both African Americans and Whites. Despite these high rates of smoking, few researchers have addressed this issue, in part because tobacco is a sacred plant to many AI and cannot be treated completely negatively, as most smoking cessation programs do. Researchers at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) and Johnson County Community College (JCCC) have been working with regional partners using community- based participatory research (CBPR) to address recreational tobacco since 2003. We have developed a successful culturally tailored program, All Nations Breath of Life (ANBL), that respects tobacco as a sacred plant and promotes honoring it rather than abusing it recreationally. Our in-person, group-based program had an intent-to-treat quit rate of 27.9% versus 17.4% compared to current best practices at end of treatment (12 weeks) in a reservation-based efficacy trial (N=463). Cessation was 20% vs. 12% at 6 months (p=0.02). In a large urban implementation feasibility study (N=312 across five states), the quit rate was 22% at 6-months (p<0.002 compared to the highest previously reported rates for an urban AI population); retention was 71%. Based on a request from the community, we created an individual telephone-based version of the program, tANBL, which was pilot tested with N=33 individuals and had a 24.2% quit rate at 6 months, assuming those lost to follow-up as smokers. The program had an 81.8% retention rate at 6 months. We are now ready to formally test tANBL for efficacy; that is proposed here using a Bayesian Adaptive Design (BAD) and our community-based participatory research (CBPR) framework. We will address the following specific aims: (1) To compare tANBL with an individual non-tailored telephone-based comparison program (CP) using a Bayesian Adaptive Design (n=500); (2) To examine the acceptability and feasibility of implementing an individual telephone-based ANB and (3) To compare individual telephone ANBL with an individual non-tailored telephone-based comparison program using a Bayesian Adaptive Design (N=500). Our primary endpoint will be 7-day point prevalence abstinence from recreational smoking biochemically verified by salivary cotinine level at 6 months post-baseline. Quit rates in the ANBL program will be significantly better than in the non- tailored program (24% versus 10%). We will address the following secondary aims: (1) To compare tANBL and CP 30-day point prevalence and continuous abstinence rates at 6 months and 12 months post-baseline; (2) To examine individual factors such as type of pharmacotherapy (if any), level of addiction, use of other nicotine products such as e-cigarettes, quitting history, motivation, tobacco health literacy, social support, self- efficacy, ethnic identity, psychosocial health and demographic factors for effect on quit rates; (3) To maximize and assess the cultural relevance of the intervention program and all of its components and (4) To identify factors that enhance dissemination of telephone-based ANBL and contribute to program success or failure.

"The Impact of Tobacco Control Policies on Health Equity in the United States Project Summary Abstract Since the mid-1900s, tobacco control policies have effectively decreased smoking prevalence in the United States. However, important disparities by socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity in smoking prevalence and tobacco-related health outcomes persist. People with relatively lower education and income are more likely to smoke than their more affluent counterparts. In addition, although non-Hispanic Blacks and non-Hispanic Whites have a similar prevalence of smoking, Blacks have lower quit rates and higher lung cancer incidence and mortality than Whites. Hispanics, on the other hand, smoke less than Blacks or Whites. This suggests that current tobacco control policies do not adequately reduce, let alone eliminate, smoking disparities in vulnerable subgroups. However, few policy evaluations address smoking disparities, and the effects of policies across different SES and racial/ethnic subgroups are mostly unknown. Moreover, tobacco control policies are generally designed with broad populations in mind, without a focus on reducing the prevalence of smoking among specific populations. As a consequence, some policies may actually be exacerbating smoking disparities, even if their net population effect is positive. The objective of this study is to determine the health equity impact of established and emerging tobacco control policies in the US. The proposed project will: (1) determine how tobacco control policies influence disparities in smoking initiation among youth; (2) determine how tobacco control policies influence disparities in smoking cessation among adults; and (3) predict which combination of policies are needed to reduce health disparities in tobacco- attributable mortality over time using a tobacco policy simulation model. Aims 1 and 2 will systematically analyze two large, nationally-representative surveys over time to determine the extent to which tobacco control policies in the US affect disparities for smoking initiation and cessation, focusing on the differential impact of policies by education, income, and race/ethnicity (i.e., Whites, Blacks, Hispanics), and their possible intersection with gender. Aim 3 will integrate the evidence developed in Aims 1 and 2 into a simulation model to predict how policies, individually and in combination, will affect smoking disparities and future downstream tobacco-attributable deaths. The proposed study will take the field beyond describing smoking disparities to producing concrete, actionable evidence informing which tobacco control policies may be most effective in simultaneously reducing both overall smoking and tobacco-related health disparities. Knowledge gained from this study will guide policy-makers’ decisions regarding implementation of specific tobacco control policies by highlighting the importance of considering their contribution to tobacco-related health disparities. Project Narrative The proposed study will examine how tobacco control policies in the US affect disparities by socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity in smoking initiation and cessation.

Despite the magnitude of the problem, there is a fundamental knowledge gap in our understanding of the mechanisms that promote tobacco use in females. If this knowledge gap is not filled, then reducing tobacco use and developing specialized medications for female smokers will remain largely incomprehensible. The long-term goal of our research program is to identify the mechanisms that mediate tobacco use among different clinical populations that are uniquely susceptible to this problem. The objective of this renewal is to determine the neural mechanisms that promote tobacco use in females. The central hypothesis is that females are more susceptible to tobacco use than males because of stronger rewarding effects of nicotine and heightened anxiety produced by withdrawal from this drug. Our mechanistic hypothesis is that estradiol (E2) promotes the rewarding effects of nicotine and magnifies the stress produced by nicotine withdrawal in females. More specifically, we postulate that sex differences in response to nicotine are modulated within the neural circuits of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), where dopamine is increased following nicotine administration and decreased during withdrawal from this drug. Thus, females experience greater rewarding effects of nicotine in the presence of E2, which promotes dopamine release in the NAcc. Following repeated nicotine exposure, opponent processes develop to counteract the chronic over-activation of dopamine release. We suggest that the emergence of these opponent processes is evident during withdrawal from chronic nicotine as an increase in the stress hormone, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in the NAcc. This increase in CRF levels enhances the inhibitory tone in the NAcc, which results in a decrease in dopamine release during nicotine withdrawal. Thus, females experience greater anxiety during nicotine withdrawal in the presence of E2, which promotes the recruitment of opponent stress systems that suppress dopamine release in the NAcc. The proposed studies reflect a multi- disciplinary approach involving neurochemical, behavioral, and gene transfer techniques to compare sex differences in the rewarding effects of nicotine (Aim 1) and the aversive states produced by withdrawal (Aim 2) because both of these factors are believed to promote tobacco use in females. The approach to studying sex differences involves comparisons of male, female, and OVX female rats. If the removal of ovarian hormones reverses the proposed measures in females, then the role of E2 will be assessed in OVX rats that will receive E2 supplementation and will be tested following E2 or vehicle administration. At the completion of this project, our findings will help us develop a unifying hypothesis regarding the factors that promote tobacco use in females. This exemplifies the significance of this research because a better understanding of the mechanisms that fuel tobacco use in females will lead to more effective treatments to reduce health disparities in women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because our findings will be an important step toward elucidating the neural substrates that promote addiction pathology in women. Thus, our studies are relevant to the mission of NIH to support research aimed at reducing the burden of tobacco abuse, especially in women who are most vulnerable to the long-term effects of tobacco use.",Sex Differences in the Mechanisms that Promote Nicotine Reward and Withdrawal,9926445,R01DA021274,"['Anxiety ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' corticotropin releasing hormone ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticoliberin ', ' CRF-41 ', ' ACTH-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Dopamine ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estradiol ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mission ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neurochemical ', ' neurochemistry ', ' Nicotine ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Nicotine Withdrawal ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Self Administration ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' drug withdrawal ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Microdialysis ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Technology Transfer ', ' tobacco abuse ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' Infusion ', ' experience ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' novel ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Ovarian hormone ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' response ', ' Gene Transfer Techniques ', ' Transgenesis ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Supplementation ', ' Gene Transfer ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' health economics ', ' Population ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' anxiety-like behavior ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' recruit ', ' nicotine use ', ' nicotine consumption ', ' nicotine exposure ', ' exposure to nicotine ', ' tobacco cessation intervention ', ' tobacco cessation treatment ', ' Sex Differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO,R01,2019,10937,0.09801115594627277
"Telephone-Delivered Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Smoking Cessation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Smoking cessation telephone quit lines (QLs), available in all 50 states; now serve over 500,000 smokers each year. On average, only 14% (range: 8% to 20%) of QL callers stop smoking by the 12 month follow-up even with the aid of traditional Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) combined with pharmacotherapy (typically nicotine replacement therapy; NRT). The low quit rates of QLs stifle their great potential public health impact. To address the low quit rate problem, and thereby start a new research paradigm focused on innovative QL behavioral intervention content, we propose to test a novel counseling approach, called Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT), as a telephone-delivered quit smoking intervention. We recently completed a small (N = 121) NIDA R21 pilot randomized QL trial of proactively-delivered ACT vs. CBT in state QL callers that was underpowered due to R21 budget limits. Results showed that ACT: (1) was feasible to implement and evaluate in a state QL context, (2) had higher participant engagement and satisfaction than CBT, (3) had higher levels of acceptance of cravings than CBT, which in turn predicted quitting smoking, and (4) had higher (albeit non-significant) 6-month post randomization quit rates than CBT. Building on these promising and non- definitive results, a comparative effectiveness randomized trial with a large and fully-powered sample size (N = 1168) and longer term follow-up (i.e., 12 months) is now needed to definitively determine whether telephone- delivered ACT: (1) provides higher quit rates than CBT, (2) operates according to its theory-based mechanisms, and (3) is more cost-effective than CBT. Accordingly, we propose to conduct a randomized comparative effectiveness trial of telephone-delivered ACT counseling plus NRT (n=584) versus telephone-delivered traditional CBT counseling plus NRT (n=584) in state quit line callers, in order to demonstrate that telephone-delivered ACT: (1) has significantly higher 30-day point prevalence abstinence at 12 months post-randomization than telephone-delivered traditional CBT; (2) has smoking cessation outcomes significantly mediated by three psychological processes central to the theoretical model underlying ACT: acceptance of internal (a) sensations, (b) emotions, and (c) thoughts that cue smoking; (3) Will be significantly more cost-effective than telephone-delivered CBT, as measured by cost per additional quitter, incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER), and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The study, well-motivated by preliminary results, shows exciting promise for improving the success rates of quit lines and thereby lowering healthcare costs and reducing premature tobacco-related deaths. If shown to be efficacious and cost-effective, ACT would provide the scientific field a new conceptual model of QL intervention and quit lines a new treatment approach that could help 45,000 more (of the 500,000) quit line callers to stop smoking each year, thereby saving in medical costs and prolonging lives. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Smoking cessation telephone quit lines (QLs), available in all 50 states; now serve over 500,000 smokers each year. This randomized trial will definitively test a telephone-delivered Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT) intervention for adult smoking cessation.

"A Scalable e-Health Smoking Cessation Intervention for Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Veterans PROJECT SUMMARY Although cigarette smoking rates have declined in the US over the past 50 years, there has been an upturn in smoking among military personnel in the last several decades. With over 8 million Veteran enrollees, the Veterans Health Administration serves 75% of low-income and disabled Veterans. Less than 5% of Veterans receiving care through VHA access intensive treatment for smoking cessation, and these services employ a standard approach to cessation counseling that is most relevant for smokers who are ready to quit. To optimize acceptability, reach, and effectiveness, cessation treatments for Veteran smokers should be appropriate for all levels of readiness to quit. A web-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy program, Flexiquit, has shown great promise in increasing quit rates for smokers in all stages of readiness to quit (52% vs. 14% in a wait-list control group). Web-based delivery makes the program readily scalable to the population level. In this study, we propose development and pilot testing of Vet Flexiquit, an adaptation of Flexiquit for US Veteran cigarette smokers. The study will be conducted in two phases. The first phase will consist of adaptation and iterative usability testing with low-income Veteran smokers (n=20). The second phase will be a pilot feasibility trial (n=50) comparing Vet Flexiquit to the SmokefreeVET web site. The primary goals of the pilot study are to compare Vet Flexiquit to SmokefreeVET on acceptability (i.e., user satisfaction and number of log-ins) and efficacy for impacting theory-based change processes and promoting smoking cessation. This pilot project is significant and innovative in four key respects: (1) it addresses the top cause of cancer and other preventable diseases among socioeconomically disadvantaged US Veterans served by VHA, (2) it applies a novel treatment approach and advances the science of ACT for smoking cessation by testing its effectiveness for smokers at all stages of readiness to quit rather than only among smokers who are ready to quit, (3) web- based delivery has high potential reach, cost-effectiveness, and scalability within VHA, a health care setting where tobacco cessation is under-resourced; and (4) gamification and inclusion of virtual coaches as engagement strategies are substantially different than standard web-based tobacco treatments, including SmokefreeVET. If found to be effective in a larger trial, Vet Flexiquit would be well-positioned for VHA-wide scale-up due to its low maintenance cost and high potential reach, and the core program could be built upon in innovative ways (e.g., capability for virtual coaches to understand and respond to natural language) to further improve engagement and outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Smoking prevalence among Veterans is higher than the general population, in part because current treatment options do not address their needs. A targeted web-based intervention employing a novel treatment approach and designed for smokers at all stages of quit readiness could improve both the reach and efficacy of treatment for Veteran smokers and have high public health impact as a means of reducing the smoking prevalence in this tobacco-related health disparities population.",A Scalable e-Health Smoking Cessation Intervention for Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Veterans,9717852,R21CA236980,"['Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Control Groups ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Methodology ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Motivation ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' Relapse ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Smoking ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' Veterans ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Measures ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Caring ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' health administration ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biochemical ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' satisfaction ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' integrated healthcare systems ', ' integrated health system ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Cigarette Smoker ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' success ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Low income ', ' Tobacco-Related Carcinoma ', ' tobacco-related cancer ', ' tobacco-induced cancer ', ' Address ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' digital ', ' virtual human ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' usability ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' natural language ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' eHealth ', ' e-Health ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' feasibility trial ', ' ']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R21,2019,195864,0.28400001369561373

"Effect of Tobacco Advocacy at the State Level PROJECT SUMMARY Tobacco use remains the nation's leading cause of preventable death. The emergence of e-cigarettes and legalized marijuana use, and the increasing concentration of tobacco use among some racial and ethnic groups, poor people, people with mental illness, and young adults are all changing the environment in which tobacco control efforts take place. High quality state and local tobacco control policies and programs not only prevent tobacco use and disease, but can be an important component of health care cost containment, a key concern at all levels of government and in the private sector. The tobacco industry continues to work to stop or blunt these efforts' effectiveness. All tobacco control programs are not equally effective at reducing smoking and health care costs, making it important to quantify the effects of tobacco control policies and programs. Our research will inform the development and implementation of effective tobacco control policies and programs in this rapidly changing environment through three specific aims: 1. Identify and analyze the new challenges to state and local tobacco control policymaking and program  implementation to inform the development of effective responses to these challenges. 2. Identify policy and demographic determinants of smoking initiation, progression and cessation, including  smokefree policy coverage and cigarette taxes, as well as variation in these determinants by race/ethnicity  and socioeconomic status. 3. Quantify the magnitude and quality of tobacco control program spending across states and the relationship  between associated changes in smoking behavior and healthcare expenditures. We will pursue Aim 1 through a series of detailed case studies of the development and effects of state tobacco control policies and programs on tobacco use. For Aim 2 we will merge national datasets, beginning with the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, with policy data on clean indoor air laws, tobacco taxes, price and demographic variables to develop new models of smoking behavior that will provide a framework for better understanding how these policies affect individual behavior and health disparities. We will pursue Aim 3 using modern econometric methods to quantify the effects of state tobacco control programs, allowing for differences in program effectiveness on smoking behavior and, in turn, the effects of both smoking and tobacco control programs on health care costs. This more sophisticated understanding of what tobacco control policies and programs are most effective, together with understanding the tobacco industry's evolving efforts to block these policies, will help public health professionals develop, implement, and defend effective tobacco control policies and strategies that respond to this changing environment.   PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death, accounting for 1/3 of all cancer deaths and 540,000 deaths annually. Reducing this burden requires understanding the health impact (including on associated healthcare costs) of different tobacco control programs and policies as well as how the tobacco industry works to block these efforts and maintain a favorable environment to promote tobacco use. This research will inform health authorities on how to use increasingly limited resources most efficiently to prevent tobacco use and promote cessation.",Effect of Tobacco Advocacy at the State Level,9693701,R01DA043950,"['Accounting ', ' Aerosols ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cost Containment ', ' Cost Control ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' health care expenditure ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' marihuana ', ' Marijuana ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Nicotine ', ' Private Sector ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Smoking ', ' Taxes ', ' Tobacco ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Work ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Businesses ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Advocacy ', ' improved ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Shapes ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' tobacco company ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' interest ', ' authority ', ' Cigarette ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' Environmental Tobacco Smoke ', ' secondhand smoke ', ' second hand smoke ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Legal ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Smoking and Health Research ', ' Smoking and Health ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' tobacco control ', ' tobacco prevention ', ' tobacco use prevention ', ' prevent tobacco use ', ' Population ', ' Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act ', ' FSPTCA ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' ecigarette ', ' ecig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' marijuana legalization ', ' legalized marijuana ', ' legalized cannabis ', ' legal marijuana ', ' cannabis legalization ', ' marijuana use ', ' cannabis use ', ' THC use ', ' THC co-use ', ' tribal lands ', ' National Longitudinal Survey of Youth ', ' preventable death ', ' preventable mortality ', ' electronic cigarette use ', ' ecigarette use ', ' ecig use ', ' e-cigarette use ', ' e-cig use ', ' econometrics ', ' tobacco products ', ' ']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,541346,0.21564291047954182
"ASPiRE: Advancing Science & Practice in the Retail Environment Center Summary/Abstract  New population-based interventions to restrict the sales and distribution of tobacco products are increasingly common at the local level, despite little systematic research on these efforts. The retail environment – comprised of the built environment (retailer quantity and location) and consumer environment (price, product availability, and promotion at the point of sale) – is a critical emerging opportunity for tobacco control. The overall goal of the Advancing Science and Practice in the Retail Environment (ASPiRE) Program Project is to build a rigorous, scientific evidence base for effective tobacco control in the retail environment to reduce tobacco use, tobacco-related disparities, and the public health burdens of tobacco including tobacco- related cancers. The specific aims of ASPiRE are to: 1) fill important gaps in the evidence base about the impact of tobacco retailer density and tobacco product availability and promotion on tobacco use and tobacco- related health outcomes (e.g., cancer); 2) evaluate the potential of local retail interventions to reduce socioeconomic disparities in exposure to the tobacco retail environment and improve cessation outcomes; 3) evaluate the underlying mechanisms and effectiveness of different options for intervening in the retail environment to increase the costs of tobacco use, increase cessation, and reduce consumption; and 4) enhance community capacity to implement evidence-based tobacco control practices in retail settings.  Three innovative research projects are integral to these aims and will examine the degree to which tobacco retailer density contributes to tobacco use and tobacco-related disease over time using archival data (Project 1), evaluate the impact of local retail interventions on tobacco use outcomes using data from a longitudinal panel of tobacco users adult smokers (Project 2) and develop computational modeling to simulate community-level interventions to understand how changes in the built and consumer environments may lead to improved public health (Project 3). Each research project will produce unique and complementary scientific knowledge that will advance the retail tobacco control evidence base.  The administrative core and two shared resource cores that specialize in 1) data management and biostatistics, and 2) dissemination and implementation will enhance the impact and reach of the scientific aims and increase synergy among the research and results from the three projects. ASPiRE takes a `team science' approach and leverages a successful, enduring collaboration that was established over 5 years of previous funding from NCI's State & Community Tobacco Control Initiative (U01-CA154281). If ASPiRE achieves its aims, it will be a national resource for the emerging area of tobacco control retail science and speed translation of retail science into evidence-based community practices that will reduce the public health burden of tobacco use. Project Narrative Tobacco use causes nearly half of a million premature deaths each year from cancer, cardiovascular disease, and pulmonary illnesses. This Program Project will identify the role that tobacco retail outlets play in promoting tobacco use and causing tobacco-related illnesses.

"Menthol Tobacco Sales Restrictions and Smoking Disparities Project Summary and Abstract The plummeting prevalence of cigarette smoking in the US in the last decade is a profound and ongoing public health accomplishment. This has been largely driven by policies, such as taxation, which effectively make tobacco more costly or otherwise difficult to obtain. However, while consumption of non-menthol cigarettes has declined, menthol cigarette use has actually increased in recent years, suggesting that these policies may have had a lesser impact on groups that overwhelmingly favor menthol cigarettes, such as African American smokers. African Americans bear a highly disproportionate burden from various smoking-related conditions including heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer when compared to other racial/ethnic groups in the US. Given the central role that menthol cigarettes play in causing tobacco-related disease disparities, and acknowledging that policy has been the critical lever for reducing smoking prevalence in the general population, there is an urgent need to better understand how emerging policy opportunities might influence cigarette consumption among African Americans. In recent years, policies that would fully or partially remove menthol-flavored tobacco from the market have been considered at both the local and federal level, however it is unclear what kind of real-world impact a menthol tobacco sales restriction might have on tobacco use prevalence and disparities. The objective of this application is to determine how a city-wide restriction on the sale of menthol tobacco products impacts smoking among African American adults living in the metropolitan area. Presently there is a unique opportunity to evaluate a city-initiated menthol tobacco sales restriction policy. Starting on August 1, 2018, a menthol tobacco sales restriction goes into effect in Minneapolis, MN. We propose an innovative case-cohort study design, utilizing online recruitment and surveying, to measure this policy's impact on African American's smoking. One year after the policy goes into effect, we will recruit, from the population of Twin Cities, MN metropolitan area African Americans, “cases” who have smoked in the previous two years but not recently, as well as “controls” who are current smokers. The main exposures of interest will be geographic (i.e. residing within vs. outside of Minneapolis, distance to city border, etc.) We will accomplish the proposal's objective through these specific aims: 1) Determine how a policy banning menthol-flavored tobacco relates to cigarette consumption among African American smokers in the Twin Cities, MN metropolitan region. 2) Identify how the impact of a policy banning menthol flavored tobacco within Minneapolis may be modified by factors related to geography and individuals' life patterns. It is anticipated that these aims will yield the following expected outcomes. First, they will illuminate the effects of a menthol-ban policy on African American adults' smoking. Second, they will provide direction for how such a policy could be optimized to prevent disease and reduce disparities. These aims are expected to have positive impact because an evidence basis is critical for implementing prudent tobacco control policies. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to the public's health because it will provide evidence for whether policies that restrict the sale of cigarettes with menthol flavoring impact tobacco use among African American adults. The discovery of policy options that promote tobacco-free lifestyles, reduce chronic disease risk, and thus enhance health in populations that bear a disproportionate burden of disease is relevant to the NIH's mission.",Menthol Tobacco Sales Restrictions and Smoking Disparities,9735197,R21CA229297,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cities ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Evaluation Methodology ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Marketing ', ' Menthol ', ' Minnesota ', ' Mission ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sales ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Taxation ', ' Tobacco ', ' Twins ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' distilled alcoholic beverage ', ' liquor ', ' Smoker ', ' non-smoker ', ' nonsmoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' tobacco company ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Flavoring ', ' Flavoring Agents ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' interest ', ' metropolitan ', ' Municipalities ', ' Cigarette ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Portraits ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Smoking History ', ' Output ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' recruit ', ' tobacco-free ', ' tobacco products ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2019,162450,0.2134351719642851
"Integrating Longitudinal Data to Examine Directional, Synergistic and Differential Effects of Tobacco Control Policies on Smoking Abstract Although significant progress has been made in reducing smoking rates in the United States, one in seven Americans continues to smoke, and smoking remains the leading preventable cause of death in this country. Evidence suggests that tobacco control policies, including cigarette excise taxes, smokefree air laws and tobacco control program funding, can effectively reduce tobacco consumption in general. What remains unknown are which combinations of tobacco control policies are most effective, whether policy-related gains can be maintained during periods of policy retrenchment, and whether tobacco policies can shrink strong socioeconomic smoking disparities. To examine these questions, we propose to develop and analyze a dataset that integrates longitudinal observations of individual smoking behavior with measures of state and local tobacco control policy exposure, as well as area measures of socioeconomic status. Using repeated observations of 18,407 individuals' smoking behavior as policies change in their home state, county or city, or as they move to a new place with different policies, we aim to identify whether changes in adult smoking behavior following exposure to stronger tobacco control policies are the inverse of changes in behavior observed following exposure to weaker policies, and assess which policy combinations are most likely to be effective in the current context. By incorporating measures of individual and area income and educational status, we further aim to estimate the impact of single and combined tobacco control policy options on socioeconomic disparities in smoking. Our team has expertise in several areas, including tobacco control, policy evaluation and longitudinal data analysis. This innovative policy analysis method could be used to complement more traditional policy evaluation techniques for other health-related policies as well. Project Narrative State and local tobacco control policies have contributed to the decline in overall tobacco use over the last half century, but further policy progress has recently stalled, and socioeconomic disparities in smoking remain strong. Whether policy-related gains can be maintained during periods of policy retrenchment, the most effective combinations of tobacco control policies, and whether tobacco policies can shrink socioeconomic smoking disparities remains unclear. In the proposed project, we aim to integrate individual smoking information from a national longitudinal dataset currently under-utilized in tobacco research with state and local measures of tobacco control policies, in order to estimate directional, synergistic and differential policy effects on smoking.","Integrating Longitudinal Data to Examine Directional, Synergistic and Differential Effects of Tobacco Control Policies on Smoking",9647544,R21CA222525,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Air ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Cities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Environment ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Laws ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Taxes ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' residence ', ' residential site ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' high school ', ' Municipalities ', ' Cigarette ', ' Participant ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' Modeling ', ' Drops ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' trend ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' tobacco control ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' evidence base ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' panel study of income dynamics ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2019,196752,0.2367785633955577
"Applying mHealth to Tobacco-related Health Disparities: Enhancing aspects of Resiliency to aid Cessation Efforts ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and is the leading cause of lung cancer. The majority of individuals who smoke indicate they want to quit, and although half of all smokers make a quit attempt every year, only 6% successfully do so. Lower education levels, poverty, and unemployment are potent predictors of greater difficulty quitting smoking. Additionally, SES-related tobacco disparities have increased over the last several decades. Increased knowledge regarding those factors that allow individuals to be successful in staying quit is key to eliminatig smoking-related cancers and illnesses in these populations. One promising factor related to increased cessation success is mindfulness, which is the ability to attend to the present moment with purpose (e.g., not on autopilot) and without labeling thoughts/emotions/sensations as good or bad (e.g., an attitude of nonjudgment). Mindfulness is associated with increased cessation success and with key mechanisms influencing cessation such as affect and self-regulatory capacity. However, there is a distinct lack of data on real-time, real-world measures of smoking, the underlying mechanisms associated with abstinence (particularly those that may be unique among low SES populations), and how mindfulness impacts those potential mechanisms. The objective of this application is to utilize real-time, real-world measurement approaches (i.e., ecological momentary assessment [EMA] and AutoSense) to examine the impact of mindfulness on key mechanisms underlying smoking cessation among low SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers. Christine Vinci, Ph.D. is a postdoctoral fellow at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and is seeking 5 years of support through the K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award through the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, in order to examine the role of mindfulness on key mechanisms implicated in cessation among low SES, diverse populations. This proposal directly addresses the mission of NIMHD to ""lead scientific research to improve minority health and eliminate health disparities."" Dr. Vinci's research broadly focuses on cognitive and affective mechanisms (e.g., affect regulation, expectancies, self- efficacy) implicated in the development, maintenance, and treatment of substance use disorders. More specifically, her work aims to understand the mechanisms underlying smoking and alcohol use among underserved populations, with a specific focus on mindfulness. A better understanding of the effects of mindfulness on smoking and problematic drinking, and the mechanisms through which mindfulness-based interventions impact these disorders could help in the development of new and more effective interventions. For this award, the primary research aims are twofold. First, the examination of trait and state mindfulness on momentary mechanisms gathered via advanced technology (EMA and AutoSense) among low SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers will be conducted via secondary data analysis of existing datasets of Dr. Vinci's primary mentor, Dr. David Wetter. Second, the feasibility of providing mindfulness strategies in real-time to low SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers attempting to quit smoking, based on objective data collected via AutoSense technology, will be examined. The first aim will take place during the K99 phase of the award, where Dr. Vinci will be provided with guidance by expert mentors in their respective fields. The training and guidance received during the K99 phase will directly inform the implementation of the second aim, which will take place during the R00 phase of the award. This project is highly innovative because 1) to date, no studies have examined these constructs via real-world, real-time data among low SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers through combined approaches such as EMA and AutoSense, and 2) findings can directly inform treatment development to specify how mindfulness impacts underlying mechanisms, leading to the reduction of tobacco- related health disparities. Dr. Vinci's training goals include learning how to design and implement research protocols that utilize advanced technology to collect participant data (EMA and AutoSense), how to conduct advanced statistical analyses on multi-level, longitudinal data, and how to combine knowledge and strategies from diverse areas of research (i.e., models linking social determinants and SES to health outcomes, tobacco use and dependence, resiliency and mindfulness, self-regulation) to create intervention approaches to reduce health disparities. Both the training received through this award and the preliminary data Dr. Vinci will collect and analyze, will aid her in the transition to an independent clinical researcher, where she will examine relevant mechanisms via mobile technology and implement mindfulness-based strategies to reduce problematic health behaviors and improve quality of life among diverse populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cigarette smoking is one of the leading causes of preventable death in the US, the primary cause of lung cancer, and is one of the leading causes of health disparities. Assisting individuals in staying quit is vital to eliminating smoking-related cancers, particularly among low SES, racial/ethnic populations, as these groups are most impacted by cancer-related health disparities. This research will build upon and expand what we know about smoking relapse and can potentially contribute to enhancing smoking cessation treatments, specifically targeting the prevention of relapse once an individual successfully quits smoking.",Applying mHealth to Tobacco-related Health Disparities: Enhancing aspects of Resiliency to aid Cessation Efforts,9617156,R00MD010468,"['Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Emotions ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Perinatal Attentional Retraining Intervention for Smoking (PARIS) for Minority Women ABSTRACT Racial and ethnic minorities and women experience a disproportionate burden of smoking-related diseases, including cancer and heart disease. Maternal smoking is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the mother, and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and increased infant morbidity and mortality. This further compounds the disparities in adverse birth outcomes experienced by racial and ethnic minorities. Nearly half of women who smoke prior to pregnancy achieve abstinence during pregnancy. Unfortunately, nearly 80% of abstinent women relapse within a year after delivery. Despite considerable study, there are few strategies that effectively combat smoking relapse in this population. This is especially true for minority women who are less likely to receive treatment and more likely to relapse to smoking postpartum than non-Hispanic whites. Smokers exhibit an “attention bias” for smoking-related cues. Attentional bias plays a role in the maintenance or escalation of smoking by increasing subjective cravings and directly affecting cigarette seeking behavior. Attentional retraining (AR) using the visual probe task has been used experimentally to reduce attentional bias and blunt cue-provoked craving. Stress and negative affect are considered major drivers of relapse, especially in women. AR is effective at attenuating anxiety related to transition stress, such as that experienced by women postpartum. The overarching goal of this pilot project is to test a novel technique, the use of smartphones to administer AR, as an intervention for smoking relapse prevention in postpartum women. AR will target both smoking cues and stress cues. We will assess whether AR reduces attentional bias, blunts cue-provoking smoking cravings after delivery, attenuates stress, and reduces smoking lapses. We propose to randomize 50 abstinent pregnant African American and/or Hispanic smokers to receive either the AR or control visual probe task. Participants will be asked to carry around a smartphone as they go about their daily lives for 2 weeks in their last month of pregnancy. The smartphone will sound an alert randomly during the day, at which time participants will be asked to respond to a short set of questions assessing subjective states; this will be followed by a request to complete the AR (or control) procedures. This same procedure will be repeated for 2 weeks in the first postpartum month. Outcome measures include attentional bias for smoking and stress stimuli, self-reported craving and perceived stress, and percentage of days and number of cigarettes smoked during the trial. This application is designed to confirm the feasibility and process parameters of the study, and obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of the intervention and the components that comprise the intervention. If AR shows promise as a treatment, it will be tested in a larger randomized controlled trial. The proposed project is a novel intervention for postpartum minority women that builds on the naturally occurring period of abstinence, and has the potential to consolidate and extend abstinence beyond pregnancy. NARRATIVE Smoking is the leading cause of preventable cancer mortality in women, with African American and Hispanic women having an even greater burden tobacco-related morbidity and mortality.

"Tobacco retail policy innovation to reduce health disparities ABSTRACT The significant progress made toward ending the tobacco epidemic has primarily resulted from policy changes, including tobacco tax increases and smokefree policies. However, research suggests that even if progress on existing prevention and cessation programs is accelerated, an end to the tobacco epidemic is unlikely to be achieved without additional policy innovations. The tobacco retail environment has become a focus of current tobacco control policy conversations, with studies exploring the impact of reduced retailer density. An as yet unstudied approach is using the existing infrastructure of states with alcohol (or potentially marijuana) control retail systems to restrict tobacco sales. Transitioning tobacco sales (TTS) to state retail outlets would enable states to increase control over price, point-of-sale advertising, numbers and types of brands, hours, and outlet density. Disadvantaged communities could experience the greatest benefit, given the current concentration of tobacco outlets in lower income and racially diverse neighborhoods. However, no research has assessed the feasibility, obstacles to and potential health and revenue effects of such a move.The overall objective of this project is to evaluate the prospects for and potential impact of implementing TTS as a way to reduce tobacco accessibility, tobacco use, and tobacco-related health disparities. The project's specific aims are: Specific Aim #1: Conduct a comprehensive appraisal of the potential for and obstacles to moving sales of combustible tobacco products to state retail outlets in 12 states with such systems for alcohol control and sales, and in 2 potential marijuana control states; Specific Aim #2: Examine the extent to which economic and other disparities in the retail accessibility of tobacco could be reduced by limiting sales to state-controlled liquor stores; Specific Aim #3: Using a validated tobacco control simulation model, analyze the impact on smoking prevalence, smoking attributable deaths, health-related outcomes, and state revenues of moving tobacco product sales to state-controlled liquor outlets. This research answers a recent call by the Tobacco Control Research Priorities Working Group of the NCI Board of Scientific Advisors for research on innovative tobacco control policy initiatives that are potentially transformative. Pinpointing the health and economic impacts of moving tobacco sales to state-run stores could lay the groundwork for policymaker consideration of this or more incremental retailer reduction measures. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tobacco use is the most important preventable cause of death and disease in the United States and contributes to health disparities. Progress toward ending the tobacco epidemic has primarily resulted from policy changes. This mixed-methods research will develop knowledge that may be used to reduce tobacco accessibility and tobacco-related health disparities through assessing the prospects for, obstacles to, and outcomes of policy innovation using state retail infrastructure.",Tobacco retail policy innovation to reduce health disparities,9805340,R01CA229238,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Advertising ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' marihuana ', ' Marijuana ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Running ', ' Sales ', ' Schools ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Taxes ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' West Virginia ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' density ', ' Licensing ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' distilled alcoholic beverage ', ' liquor ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' System ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' experience ', ' Municipalities ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' economic impact ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Prevention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Low income ', ' Tobacco Control Research ', ' Process ', ' working group ', ' work group ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' tobacco control ', ' tobacco exposure ', ' exposure to tobacco ', ' attributable mortality ', ' attributable death ', ' health economics ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' evidence base ', ' High School Student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' Infrastructure ', ' tobacco products ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,678672,0.1566254054720188
"UAB CF Research and Translation Core Center New therapies are needed for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which accounts for over $40 billion in annual healthcare costs, is the 3rd leading cause of death in the U.S., and is major source of health disparity, being over-represented in the Deep South. Like cystic fibrosis (CF), COPD is characterized by mucus obstruction that is associated with accelerated loss of lung function and excess mortality. Cigarette smoke exhibits a variety of deleterious effects on airway epithelial function in vitro and in vivo and our preliminary data indicates it also causes a significant reduction in CFTR activity that leads to a pronounced decrement in mucociliary transport. Furthermore, CFTR dysfunction is independently associated with chronic bronchitis and dyspnea, can persist despite smoking cessation, and can be reversed by the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor in vitro and in vivo by activating wild-type CFTR, resulting in a robust increase in mucociliary transport. Combined with unprecedented clinical improvement via augmented mucociliary clearance observed in CF patients with a responsive CFTR mutation treated with ivacaftor, these data indicate that CFTR represents a viable therapeutic target to address mucus stasis in COPD patients with chronic bronchitis (potentially representing over 8 million patients in the U.S. alone). In this project, we will investigate the hypothesis that ivacaftor can augment CFTR activity in individuals with COPD who exhibit chronic bronchitis. Though our preliminary data are compelling, questions regarding the most informative and responsive endpoints and dose selection mandate the studies outlined in this application. To address this, we have designed an innovative Phase 2, Randomized, Double- blind, Placebo Controlled Pilot Trial to Determine the Safety and Efficacy of Ivacaftor (VX-770) for the Treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (The Multicenter TOPIC study), and will address a number of key questions to the field of COPD and airway epithelial biology using the latest methods for assessing CFTR activity, epithelial function, mucociliary clearance, and clinical outcomes. The TOPIC study will test whether MCC can be augmented in COPD patients with chronic bronchitis, ameliorating human disease even in the absence of congenital mutations in the CFTR gene. The trial will provide an initial proof of concept evaluating the efficacy of CFTR potentiators in COPD, and we will also examine differential effects based on race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, and smoking status. If successful, the results could establish a novel treatment paradigm to address mucus dysfunction in COPD, an important cause of morbidity that is independently associated with mortality and disease progression. Narrative New treatments are needed to reverse mucus stasis in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Ivacaftor is a new pharmacologic agent for the treatment of CF that also potentiates wild-type CFTR activity, augments mucociliary clearance and reverses acquired CFTR dysfunction caused by cigarette smoking. We propose to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ivacaftor in COPD in a Phase 2 Clinical trial that will establish efficacy, mechanism of action, and target population needed to develop an entirely new therapeutic paradigm for the third leading cause of death in the U.S. that is over represented in the deep south.",UAB CF Research and Translation Core Center,9901116,P30DK072482,"['Biology ', ' Bronchitis ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chlorides ', ' Chronic Bronchitis ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Scotine ', ' Cotinine ', ' Mucoviscidosis ', ' Cystic Fibrosis ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Breathlessness ', ' Dyspnea ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Exhibits ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Future ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' bowel ', ' Intestinal ', ' Intestines ', ' Laboratories ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Mindfulness-based Smoking Cessation Enhanced with Mobile Technology for Low-Income Smokers Project Summary/Abstract Tobacco use, a primary behavioral risk factor for cancer, is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Adults with low socioeconomic status (SES) and members of certain racial/ethnic minority groups are less likely to quit and consequently experience profound tobacco-related cancer disparities. There is an urgent need to improve upon evidence-based smoking cessation interventions to better serve these populations. Mindfulness training substantially increases rates of smoking cessation and lapse recovery. There is a dearth of research on mindfulness in low-SES and racial/ethnic minority groups, but these interventions do show promise for smoking cessation in these populations. However, additional between-session support may be needed for these smokers, who experience significant day-to-day barriers to quitting and have lower access to smoking cessation resources. Mobile health technology (mHealth) could provide vital 24/7 support for low- SES smokers. For example, personalized, interactive mHealth messages might encourage participants to use mindfulness and other smoking cessation techniques in the moments when they need them most (e.g., in times of high stress or craving), thus enhancing treatment effectiveness. Based on iterative feedback from low- SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers, we developed a text messaging program (“iQuit Mindfully”) as an adjunct to in-person mindfulness-based smoking cessation treatment. Our pilot work demonstrates that iQuit Mindfully is feasible, acceptable, and perhaps most effective for low-SES smokers (i.e., 23.1% of participants living in poverty who received iQuit Mindfully achieved abstinence at end of treatment and 1-month follow-up, while none of those living in poverty quit in the in-person-only treatment). Building on this pilot work, we will incorporate participant feedback to further increase interactivity and personalization so that iQuit Mindfully can more flexibly adapt to participants’ changing needs. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Test the efficacy of a mindfulness-based smoking cessation intervention enhanced by mHealth (iQuit Mindfully), compared to in- person mindfulness-based addiction treatment (MBAT) and usual care; and 2) Investigate the mechanisms through which MBAT and iQuit Mindfully impact smoking cessation using intensive daily diary assessment. This project aims to improve cessation outcomes for low-SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers by supplementing existing mindfulness treatment with innovative mHealth methods. Furthermore, we aim to advance the scientific study of mechanisms of action of mindfulness treatment, which could inform the development of more efficacious and efficient treatments to reduce tobacco-related cancer disparities.

"Impact of Cigar Flavor on Tobacco Use Behaviors and Addiction in Dual Users PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The rapid increase in popularity of dual use of flavored little cigars/cigarillos (LCCs) with cigarettes among U.S. young adults has significant implications for their health, addiction, and cessation. LCCs are used for two primary reasons: their relatively lower cost and flavor offerings. As cigarettes become more expensive or less reinforcing, young adults may substitute with attractively flavored LCCs rather than quit. We do not know the addictiveness of LCCs compared with cigarettes in dual users, the role that flavors play in addiction and dual use, and if flavors are more important for women than men. Moreover, the FDA has described research on cigars and flavors as a priority. Therefore, a critical need exists to characterize the addiction potential (AP) of flavored and unflavored LCCs compared with cigarettes and differences by sex in dual users.  The specific aims are to: (1) characterize the AP of LCCs compared with cigarettes; (2) determine the extent to which the AP of LCCs varies by flavor and sex of user; and (3) determine the extent to which LCC use in the home environment differs by flavored vs. unflavored. The proposed study will employ a 3-week crossover design that combines survey-based measures (including behavioral economic assessments), biomarkers, and ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) of AP, dependence, and tobacco use behaviors among 145 non-treatment-seeking young adult (18-34 years old) dual users. AP will be characterized by behavioral economic indices of demand, such as the hypothetical consumption of LCCs at escalating prices, and other standardized measures of addiction. The impact of flavors on LCC and cigarette smoking at home will be captured by EMA. This information will address the following FDA priorities: impact of changes in LCC flavors on dependence and dual use behaviors, and innovative methods to assess tobacco use behaviors.  The career development plan combines mentored hands-on training with coursework and professional development activities to meet the objectives critical to my transition to independent tobacco regulatory scientist. My career goal is to conduct research that develops our understanding of tobacco use in vulnerable populations, and informs tobacco regulation to reduce disease. I propose additional training in addictions research (including clinical trials), measurement of dependence and addiction potential, cigar regulatory research, and grantsmanship. With this training and my prior experience, I will be able to transition to an independent investigator of tobacco product flavorings and other characteristics that—with cognitive, affective, behavioral, and environmental influences—contribute to their uptake, use, and addiction. UConn Health, Brown, and Rutgers provide excellent resources for my career development, including formal coursework, seminars, expert faculty, research centers, office space, equipment, software, and data collection, analysis, and management resources. The focused training provided by this Award represents the final step in my career development and provides preliminary data and training for planned R-level grant writing. PROJECT NARRATIVE The dual use of little cigars/cigarillos (LCCs) and cigarettes is a significant public health concern for young adults' health and tobacco addiction. Among young adult dual users, this study compares the addiction potential of LCCs to cigarettes and determines if flavors enhance the addiction and if women are especially susceptible.

"Promoting Smoking Cessation among Individuals with Food Insecurity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite overall declines in the prevalence of cigarette smoking, smoking remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death. Smoking prevalence is also disproportionately concentrated among population groups that are economically disadvantaged, contributing to an uneven burden of tobacco-related health problems. Socioeconomic disparities in tobacco use persist largely because economically disadvantaged smokers are less likely to succeed in quitting than non-economically disadvantaged smokers. Many economically disadvantaged smokers are motivated to quit, but various life stressors pose significant barriers to cessation. One of the most stressful conditions in the experience of poverty is food insecurity, or the inability to afford adequate and appropriate foods needed to live an active and healthy life. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that food insecurity is independently associated with increased odds of smoking. However, proximal factors linking food insecurity and smoking are not well understood, and research has not extended this association towards informing cessation. Extant literature suggests that there are shared psychological (e.g., stress) and physiological (e.g., hunger) factors that may predispose food insecure smokers to encountering difficulties with quitting smoking. The overall goal of this proposal is to build the candidate's research expertise on the intersection of food insecurity, smoking, and quitting. This award will support the candidate's career development as a social and health psychologist whose research addresses social determinants of health to promote smoking cessation among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. The career development plan includes advanced training and mentorship in (1) social epidemiology, (2) qualitative research methods, (3) food insecurity and nutrition policy, and (4) smoking cessation intervention research. Aim 1 of the proposed study will determine whether the experience of food insecurity is associated with continued smoking among a nationally representative sample of low-income smokers, using extant longitudinal data from the 2001-2013 Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Aim 2 will target a subset of the local population with food insecurity—individuals seeking federal food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in San Francisco, California—to conduct surveys and in-depth interviews on the lived experience of food insecurity and its association with smoking behaviors and quitting. Aim 3 will develop and pilot test a smoking cessation outreach program that is delivered to 100 smokers with food insecurity in the context of SNAP, which provides a novel venue for smoking cessation and health promotion research. Taken together, this research and training plan will lay the foundation for a planned community-based randomized controlled trial of a smoking cessation intervention targeting households with food insecurity. This work has the potential to inform reductions in tobacco-related health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will identify how a key aspect of socioeconomic stress—the experience of food insecurity—is associated with smoking behaviors and smoking cessation among smokers who are economically disadvantaged. This study will also develop a smoking cessation promotion outreach program that is delivered in the context of a federal nutrition assistance program. Taken together, this research has the clear potential to address disproportionately high rates of smoking in economically disadvantaged populations by leveraging existing social service infrastructures for smoking cessation and health promotion.",Promoting Smoking Cessation among Individuals with Food Insecurity,9749120,K01DA043659,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Household ', ' Hunger ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' nutrition ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychologist ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' San Francisco ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Work ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' base ', ' career ', ' community planning ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' Development Plans ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Nutrition Policy ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Shapes ', ' Smoker ', ' non-smoker ', ' nonsmoker ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' outreach ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' psychological distress ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Population Group ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Training ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Smoking and Health Research ', ' Smoking and Health ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' pilot trial ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' safety net ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' evidence base ', ' social health determinants ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Secure ', ' food environment ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' panel study of income dynamics ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' secondary analysis ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' food insecurity ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,K01,2019,37747,0.1549178453754755
"Effect of the Housing and Urban Development’s Smokefree Public Housing Rule on Air Quality and Health in the District of Columbia Abstract The goal of this study is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the U.S. Housing and Urban Development's (HUDs) smoke-free public housing rule, effective August 3, 2018, in the District of Columbia Housing Authority. The rule prohibits lit tobacco products and hookah use in all living units, common areas, administrative office buildings, and outdoor areas up to 25 feet in all public housing facilities. A primary goal of the rule is to create healthier homes for families living in public housing. Tobacco use control laws that prohibit smoking in public places have helped reduce smoking prevalence by 40% and exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke by 71%. Even with declines in these indicators for the general population, progress has been considerably slower for low-income, racial and ethnic minorities who experience disproportionate harm from smoking and secondhand smoke exposure. Homes remain a significant source of SHSe due, in part, to the substantial amount of time adults and children spend in the home. SHSe is particularly problematic in multiunit housing, where secondhand smoke can enter non-smoking units through ventilation systems and other means. While a few studies suggest positive effects of smoke-free public housing on indoor air quality, SHSe, and smoking cessation, limitations exist. Namely, longitudinal studies with more than one post-intervention assessment, studies evaluating the effect on short- and long-term health outcomes, and studies that include objective measures of secondhand smoke exposure are needed. This study addresses the methodological limitations of current evaluation studies and is designed to evaluate the effect of HUDs rule specifically. A qualitative approach will be used to document the implementation process of the rule. A quantitative approach will be used to evaluate the effects of the rule on SHSe and health outcomes of adults and children. The evaluation will include three cohorts: a cohort of residences to assess the effect of HUDs policy on SHSe, a cohort of smoking adults to assess effects of the rule on smoking behavior, and a cohort of youth with asthma to assess effects of the rule on children's respiratory health. Baseline data collection will occur prior to August 2018, and funding from the proposed study will be used for four post-implementation assessments (up to 24-months post rule). Differential effects of the rule will be examined across family and senior/disabled communities. Evaluating this rule is critical, given that over 2 million public housing residents will be effected and the potential for this rule to reduce tobacco-related health disparities. Processes found to be effective in the current study have the potential to accelerate the implementation of tobacco control policies in the future. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed study is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the U.S. Housing and Urban Development's (HUDs) smoke-free public housing rule, effective August 3, 2018, in the District of Columbia Housing Authority.

"Financial incentives for homeless smokers: A community-based RCT PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Homeless people have a 3.5-fold higher prevalence of cigarette smoking in comparison to non-homeless people, contributing to 2-fold higher rates of lung cancer and 3- to 5-fold higher rates of tobacco-attributable death. Homeless smokers want to quit, but studies have not yet uncovered the optimal approach to help them do so. In a recently published 8-week pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program (BHCHP), we found that financial incentives for smoking abstinence were associated with 7-fold higher odds of brief smoking abstinence in comparison to a non-incentivized control condition. These results suggest that financial incentives are a promising approach for reducing smoking in this vulnerable population, although further investigation in a larger sample is needed to improve the duration of on-treatment abstinence, assess post-treatment effects, and better understand mechanisms of action and contextual factors that may influence treatment response. To address these gaps, we will conduct a community-based RCT of financial incentives for smoking abstinence among adult smokers at BHCHP. We will recruit 400 participants from 3 BHCHP sites and randomize them to receive guideline-concordant standard care with (N=200) or without (N=200) financial incentives for smoking abstinence. Standard care will consist of 8 weeks of combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and 5 sessions with a tobacco coach who will provide behavioral counseling, distribute NRT, and coordinate referrals to existing tobacco treatment resources. Incentive arm participants will additionally receive a 24-week schedule of 20 debit card payments contingent on short-term abstinence based on exhaled carbon monoxide levels, augmented with 16 interspersed payments contingent on longer-term abstinence based on urine anabasine levels. We will use an embedded-experiment mixed methods design, where qualitative (‘qual’) data collection is embedded within a larger quantitative (‘QUAN’) RCT with the following aims: Aim 1. (QUAN) To determine the effect of the financial incentives intervention on anabasine-verified 7-day smoking abstinence at A) the end of treatment (24 weeks) and B) 24 weeks after treatment (48 weeks). We hypothesize that incentive arm participants will have greater abstinence at both timepoints. Aim 2. (qual) To assess why, how, and under what circumstances homeless smokers A) achieve abstinence in response to financial incentives and B) maintain abstinence after incentives are stopped. To accomplish this aim, we will interview selected participants at 24 and 48 weeks, probing cognitive, procedural, and contextual dimensions of their response to financial incentives to generate hypotheses about mechanisms for on-treatment and post-treatment effects and to inform future work in this area. Our findings could have important tobacco treatment implications for the 934,000 people served annually in US Health Care for the Homeless programs, advancing NCI’s objective of reducing smoking in vulnerable populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Homeless people have a 3.5-fold higher prevalence of cigarette smoking in comparison to non-homeless people, contributing to 2-fold higher rates of lung cancer and 3- to 5-fold higher rates of tobacco-attributable death.

"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 African American smokers attempting to quit.",Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers,9623075,R01MD010362,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' indexing ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Poverty ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Volition ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Letters ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' interest ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' wireless ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Abstinence ', ' demographics ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' public health relevance ', ' mindfulness ', ' distress tolerance ', ' social health determinants ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' built environment ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' BD2K ', ' data to knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' smoking abstinence ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2019,742640,0.2244692431251016
"Addressing Psychological Risk Factors Underlying Smoking Persistence in COPD Patients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is caused primarily by smoking and smoking cessation is the first-line treatment for slowing disease progression. Despite this, nearly 50% of COPD patients continue to smoke following diagnosis. Smokers with COPD report high rates of co-occurring conditions – nicotine dependence, depression, and anxiety – which serve as barriers to quitting. The proposed research will develop and pilot test a behavioral intervention designed to target the common psychological factors underlying these co-occurring conditions and foster smoking cessation among COPD patients.  Primary aims of the proposed research are to: 1) Refine behavioral treatment components through qualitative interviews with patients and providers, 2) Develop a tailored behavioral treatment to address psychological risk factors among COPD patients using single case design experiments, and 3) Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effects of the multi-component intervention on smoking outcome, as compared to minimally-enhanced usual care. The proposed project will be the first to adapt a behavioral treatment to specifically target psychological risk factors among COPD patients who smoke. By addressing core psychological risk factors, the behavioral treatment may help buffer against stress associated with disease progression and increase COPD patients' exercise tolerance, engagement in pulmonary rehabilitation, and quality of life. Thus, this intervention has potential to obviate a large number of health burdens among COPD patients, and ultimately to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with COPD.  Amanda Mathew, PhD, a Research Assistant Professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, is seeking five years of support through the K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award for training and research related to development and testing of smoking cessation interventions targeted to psychological risk factors among COPD patients. Dr. Mathew's overarching career goals are to elucidate the mechanisms by which psychological factors impact cigarette smoking, develop novel interventions for smokers with medical and psychiatric comorbidities, and reduce tobacco-related health disparities. Through the proposed training plan, Dr. Mathew will expand her knowledge and skills related to intervention development; behavioral RCT design, conduct, and analysis; and smoking cessation and treatment needs specific to individuals with COPD. Dr. Mathew's multidisciplinary mentorship team has demonstrated expertise in these content areas, and is committed to Dr. Mathew's career development. Dr. Mathew's proposed work is also well-aligned with behavioral medicine research priorities within the Department of Preventive Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Although individuals diagnosed with COPD have high rates of nicotine dependence, depression, and anxiety, there is very limited understanding of the psychological risk factors that commonly drive these conditions and how they can be addressed through targeted treatment. The proposed research will develop and test a novel smoking cessation intervention among COPD patients and use qualitative data from patients and providers to guide treatment delivery. Results are expected to provide needed information on a behavioral treatment with far-reaching implications for improving behavioral health and reducing morbidity and mortality among COPD patients.",Addressing Psychological Risk Factors Underlying Smoking Persistence in COPD Patients,9753337,K23HL138165,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Buffers ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' combined treatment ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Breathlessness ', ' Dyspnea ', ' Elements ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"e-Decidete: Mobile Cessation Support for Latino Smokers Project Summary - eDecídete: Mobile Cessation Support for Latino Smokers  Latinos are less likely than non-Hispanic whites to have access to health, to have knowledge of existing smoking cessation resources, to receive advice to stop smoking, and to participate in smoking cessation programs. Mobile technologies can dramatically enhance the reach of effective smoking cessation interventions. However, the reach of mobile interventions among Latinos remains minimal despite the fact that Latinos utilize smartphones at a higher rate. The primary aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of eDecídete (Spanish for “you can choose”), an innovative 12 week mobile smoking cessation intervention based on this work that incorporates two elements: 1) a tablet-based e-health educational session that collects personal smoking-related information to develop an individualized quit plan and guide automated and interactive text messaging; and 2) a text messaging program that includes educational information, behavioral strategies, motivational and supportive messaging, and prompts to use pharmacotherapy to support smoking cessation. Aim 1. To evaluate the impact of the culturally accommodated eDecídete program versus standard care on smoking abstinence at Month 6 among Latino smokers. At Month 6, smokers in eDecídete will have significantly higher cotinine-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence (no cigarettes in the past 7 days) than smokers in the control arm. Aim 2. To assess therapeutic alliance, pharmacotherapy utilization, and self-efficacy as mediators of the presumed treatment effect on cotinine-verified 7-day smoking abstinence at Month 6 among Latino smokers. Our hypothesis is that eDecídete will have greater efficacy for smoking cessation than standard care by increasing therapeutic alliance, utilization of pharmacotherapy, and self-efficacy to quit. Aim 3. To conduct a process evaluation that can inform findings and future improvements. The evaluation will assess 1) satisfaction with the program and its components; 2) text-message system utilization patterns and common content themes in text message interactions among eDecídete participants. Project Narrative Latinos are the largest and fastest growing population in the U.S., and tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease and death among U.S. Latinos. Although enhancing tobacco use treatment for this at-risk, underserved group is a critical public health priority, little is known about effectively treating Latino smokers.

"Beyond demographics: Mixed-methods research for effective communication tools to prevent tobacco use in Hispanic adolescents and young adults PROJECT SUMMARY Health communication campaigns are a critical part of tobacco control policy, but may exacerbate health disparities if they are not thoughtfully designed. Specifically, communication campaigns tend to benefit more advantaged populations (e.g., non-Hispanic white, higher SES) while failing to reach or resonate with more disadvantaged populations. Moreover, these disadvantaged populations are exposed to tobacco marketing at disproportionately high rates. These communication inequalities can result in disparities in the rates of tobacco use. To address these health disparities, tobacco prevention campaigns must (1) be based on in-depth formative evidence in order to reach and resonate with groups most at risk for tobacco use, and (2) successfully compete with and counteract the effects of pro-tobacco marketing. This requires going beyond simple demographic targeting (by race, SES, etc.) to produce messages that deeply resonate with the target population’s social and cultural lives. To accomplish this, the proposed study uses an innovative blend of methods to understand tobacco use among Hispanic adolescents and young adults. Hispanics have higher rates of susceptibility to tobacco use, and comprise approximately one quarter of the US youth population, making them an important group for tobacco control. Moreover, much research on Hispanics fails to examine the considerable differences in this population by ethnic heritage (e.g., Mexican, Cuban, etc.). The current project will (Aim 1) Identify unique and cross-cutting psychological, social and cultural influences on tobacco use among Hispanic youth and young adults at-risk for tobacco use, and (Aim 2) Describe the pro-tobacco communications environment to which Hispanic youth are exposed. Aim 1 will be accomplished through a mix of online discussions and in-person focus groups. Online discussions are an innovative technique that allow us to obtain a diverse sample of Hispanic 15-21 year olds to examine key sub-group differences. In-person focus groups will be held in four US MSAs with the highest number of Hispanics. The in-person focus groups allow us to focus more intensely on key themes identified in the online discussions. The focus groups will use innovative techniques to access thoughts, opinions and motivations that may be difficult for participants to articulate, and will produce a deep understanding of tobacco use in this population. Aim 2 will conduct a content analysis of tobacco marketing targeting Hispanics. We will use data from the content analysis to identify key marketing tactics, and will obtain focus group participants’ perspectives on these tactics. Ultimately, these findings will be disseminated to stakeholders in collaboration with our partners at Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids (CTFK). We will develop an online toolkit that stakeholders can access on-demand, webinars to provide more focused education, and will work with CTFK to integrate our findings into their trainings. Ultimately, this project will produce novel, in-depth information to support efforts to communicate more effectively about tobacco with Hispanic youth and young adults, and to restrict tobacco marketing targeting youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project addresses communication inequalities that underlie tobacco-related health disparities. We will use an innovative blend of online discussions, in-person focus groups, and content analysis to generate sociocultural maps to tobacco use among Hispanic youth and young adults. With our study partners at Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and youth advisory board, we will disseminate these findings to stakeholders in the US to support tobacco prevention campaign development and efforts to restrict tobacco marketing.",Beyond demographics: Mixed-methods research for effective communication tools to prevent tobacco use in Hispanic adolescents and young adults,9722410,R21CA229334,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Industry ', ' Language ', ' Maps ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Perception ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Tobacco ', ' Work ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Mexican ', ' Inequality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' behavior change ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' cancer risk ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Subgroup ', ' Communication Tools ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' tobacco control ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco prevention ', ' tobacco use prevention ', ' prevent tobacco use ', ' tobacco exposure ', ' exposure to tobacco ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 21 year old ', ' twenty-one years of age ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' 21 years of age ', ' demographics ', ' evidence base ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' webinar ', ' Cuban ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' tobacco-free ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,248012,0.09625868425402939
"Behavioral Economic Approach to Reducing Maternal Smoking in Disadvantaged Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking among women is a substantial U.S. public health problem that is highly associated with socioeconomic status, especially low educational attainment. It is also a direct contributor to health disparities. For example, smoking prevalence in the U.S. exceeds 30 percent among women with < 12 years of education compared to less than 6 percent for women with graduate degrees. Smoking prevalence among disadvantaged mothers is at strikingly high levels (40-60 percent). Disadvantaged women begin smoking at an earlier age, are heavier smokers, and are more likely to be nicotine dependent and to fail at smoking cessation. Not surprisingly, disadvantaged women are also at increased risk for smoking-related adverse health outcomes, including adversely impacting the health of their children through in-utero and second-hand smoke exposure (SHSe). Despite widespread awareness of the adverse health consequences of SHSe, almost 85 percent of U.S. children from low-income families are chronically exposed. SHSe, especially from maternal smoking, increases risk for infant death, chronic respiratory infections, asthma, and other longer-term medical problems, and is estimated to increase direct medical and life-lost costs in the U.S. by > $5 billion annually. Efficacious interventions to increase maternal smoking cessation and reduce childhood SHSe are sorely needed. In this application we are proposing to test the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an intervention for promoting smoking-cessation among economically disadvantaged mothers of young children (< 11 yrs) that is based in the conceptual framework of behavioral economics and uses financial incentives to motivate behavior change. We are proposing to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing (1) usual care for smoking cessation and reducing SHSe among children, (2) usual care combined with financial incentives for objectively verified smoking abstinence and (3) usual care combined with financial incentives and also with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) using innovative procedures to enhance medication efficacy. We hypothesize that both interventions involving financial incentives will increase biochemically-verified smoking abstinence in mothers and decrease SHSe in their children, but that the largest and most cost-effective treatment effects will be achieved by combining financial incentives with NRT. Behavioral-economic measures of decision-making biases and cigarette-price sensitivity will be examined as predictors of treatment response. Overall, the proposed study has the potential to advance knowledge on efficacious, cost-effective smoking cessation for maternal smokers and protection against SHSe in children. The study also has the potential to impact policies and clinical practices regarding recommended care for combating chronic SHSe in disadvantaged children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are proposing to examine new strategies for helping economically disadvantaged mothers of young children to quit smoking and better protect their children from the harmful effects of being regularly exposed to cigarette smoke. We are especially interested in whether offering financial incentives for quitting and medications to reduce nicotine withdrawal might increase the proportion of mothers who successfully quit smoking and reduce smoke exposure and related illnesses among their children.",Behavioral Economic Approach to Reducing Maternal Smoking in Disadvantaged Women,9712677,R01HD078332,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Scotine ', ' Cotinine ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Health ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Incentives ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mothers ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' Nicotine Withdrawal ', ' pregnancy-related complications ', ' complications during pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy Complications ', ' Public Health ', ' Respiratory Infections ', ' Respiratory Tract Infections ', ' Risk ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biochemical ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Policies ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' infant death ', ' infantile death ', ' infant demise ', ' death in first year of life ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Cigarette ', ' Participant ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Reporting ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Intake ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' treatment response prediction ', ' treatment prediction ', ' therapy prediction ', ' predict treatment response ', ' predict therapy response ', ' predict therapeutic response ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Community Practice ', ' Process ', ' discount ', ' in utero ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' motivated behavior ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' maternal cigarette smoking ', ' maternal smoking ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' discounting ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' treatment effect ', ' trial comparing ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' clinical practice ', ' efficacy testing ', ' financial incentive ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' follow up assessment ', ' followup assessment ', ' Graduate Degree ', ' behavioral economics ', ' environmental tobacco smoke exposure ', ' secondhand smoke exposure ', ' second hand smoke exposure ', ' exposure to tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to SHS ', ' exposure to ETS ', ' Passive Smoke Exposure ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' lower income families ', ' recruit ', ' child services ', ' pediatric services ', ' smoking abstinence ', ' exposure to cigarette smoke ', ' cigarette smoke exposure ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R01,2019,587466,0.20551022567533364
"The Impact of Tobacco Control Policies on Health Equity in the United States Project Summary Abstract Since the mid-1900s, tobacco control policies have effectively decreased smoking prevalence in the United States. However, important disparities by socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity in smoking prevalence and tobacco-related health outcomes persist. People with relatively lower education and income are more likely to smoke than their more affluent counterparts. In addition, although non-Hispanic Blacks and non-Hispanic Whites have a similar prevalence of smoking, Blacks have lower quit rates and higher lung cancer incidence and mortality than Whites. Hispanics, on the other hand, smoke less than Blacks or Whites. This suggests that current tobacco control policies do not adequately reduce, let alone eliminate, smoking disparities in vulnerable subgroups. However, few policy evaluations address smoking disparities, and the effects of policies across different SES and racial/ethnic subgroups are mostly unknown. Moreover, tobacco control policies are generally designed with broad populations in mind, without a focus on reducing the prevalence of smoking among specific populations. As a consequence, some policies may actually be exacerbating smoking disparities, even if their net population effect is positive. The objective of this study is to determine the health equity impact of established and emerging tobacco control policies in the US. The proposed project will: (1) determine how tobacco control policies influence disparities in smoking initiation among youth; (2) determine how tobacco control policies influence disparities in smoking cessation among adults; and (3) predict which combination of policies are needed to reduce health disparities in tobacco- attributable mortality over time using a tobacco policy simulation model. Aims 1 and 2 will systematically analyze two large, nationally-representative surveys over time to determine the extent to which tobacco control policies in the US affect disparities for smoking initiation and cessation, focusing on the differential impact of policies by education, income, and race/ethnicity (i.e., Whites, Blacks, Hispanics), and their possible intersection with gender. Aim 3 will integrate the evidence developed in Aims 1 and 2 into a simulation model to predict how policies, individually and in combination, will affect smoking disparities and future downstream tobacco-attributable deaths. The proposed study will take the field beyond describing smoking disparities to producing concrete, actionable evidence informing which tobacco control policies may be most effective in simultaneously reducing both overall smoking and tobacco-related health disparities. Knowledge gained from this study will guide policy-makers’ decisions regarding implementation of specific tobacco control policies by highlighting the importance of considering their contribution to tobacco-related health disparities. Project Narrative The proposed study will examine how tobacco control policies in the US affect disparities by socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity in smoking initiation and cessation. Findings from this research will provide critical evidence to policy makers and public health professionals at the local, state, and national levels as they consider the implications of tobacco control policy choices on tobacco-related health disparities.",The Impact of Tobacco Control Policies on Health Equity in the United States,9616855,R37CA214787,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Canada ', ' Data Sources ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Investments ', ' Laws ', ' mass information media ', ' Mass Media ', ' mortality ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Sales ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Taxation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' population survey ', ' Label ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' named group ', ' Special Population ', ' success ', ' Media Campaign ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' tobacco policy ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' movie ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Subgroup ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Tobacco Control Research ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' attributable mortality ', ' attributable death ', ' time use ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' prospective ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' comparative ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' health equity ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R37,2019,503153,0.27332454784652616
"Partnering with a State Food Bank to Provide Tobacco Treatment to Underserved Smokers SUMMARY Efficiently connecting underserved smokers with limited resources to efficacious tobacco cessation treatments that are easily accessible is crucial for disease prevention and the elimination of health disparities. This study seeks to address this need through partnering with a large social service network to evaluate the efficacy and economic impact of a theoretically-based, fully automated, interactive smartphone-based smoking cessation intervention. The Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma (RFBO) is the largest hunger-relief charity in the state, and through a network of 14 Food and Resource Centers (FRC), provides food to more than 136,000 food insecure clients each week across 53 counties. Our preliminary data indicate that the prevalence of current smoking among adult clients is 46% (more than 3 times the prevalence in the general US population). Participants (n=500) will be randomized to one of two treatment conditions: 1) Standard Treatment (ST; n=250) or Automated Treatment (AT; n=250). ST participants will be electronically connected to the Oklahoma Tobacco Helpline using a tablet-based web portal that is specific to this study. This approach is designed to mirror the Ask Advise Connect (AAC) approach to linking smokers in healthcare systems with quitline treatment that our team has previously developed and evaluated. ST will be evaluated against AT, a fully automated treatment enrollment and delivery approach. In the AT condition, participants will receive an interactive smartphone- based intervention that comprises content delivered via audio/video clips and interactive text content. Much of the programming and developmental work for AT has already been completed by the Stephenson Cancer Center's mHealth Shared Resource, and results from a series of pilot studies (including work conducted in partnership with the RFBO sites) with beta versions of the mobile application are extremely encouraging. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in the form of transdermal patches will be provided to all participants (ST and AT). Our overall goal of this project is to determine if AT performs better than the more resource intensive ST approach. If efficacy is established, the AT approach will be readily scalable, easily implemented by community-based organizations, and offer an efficient way to allocate limited public health resources to tobacco control interventions. The primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of AT and ST in facilitating abstinence from smoking. It is hypothesized that at the 12-month follow-up assessment, 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence rates will be higher in AT compared to ST. Secondary aims are to: 1) Compare the magnitude of the mediated effects via common mechanisms (i.e., motivation, agency, and stress/negative affect) on smoking abstinence between the AT and ST treatment groups; and 2) Conduct economic evaluations to assess the cost and/or cost-effectiveness of AT vs. ST. There is a critical need for theoretically-based, cost-effective, and sustainable cessation treatments that have broad dissemination potential, and the AT intervention has been designed to help fill this need. NARRATIVE Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States, with tobacco use accounting for more deaths each year than the combined deaths attributable to alcohol, other drugs, homicide, suicide, motor vehicle accidents, and sexual behavior.

"Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S., and a major cause of health disparities. African American (AA) smokers have higher overall rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and lower smoking cessation rates than do white smokers. Unfortunately, the search for effective policies and interventions to reduce smoking among AAs is severely hampered by the paucity of research on the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation in this population. This longitudinal cohort study will examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 AA smokers attempting to quit. This study is guided by an overarching conceptual framework derived from models of the social determinants of health, social cognitive theories, and prior empirical findings. Participants will be assessed usin real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies consisting of ecological momentary assessment (EMA), AutoSense, and geographic positioning system (GPS). AutoSense tracks behavioral and physiologic data in real-time and can objectively detect when an individual smokes or experiences negative affect/stress. GPS permits real-time spatial mapping of location patterns, which can be paired with EMA and Autosense data, and with relevant environmental exposures/characteristics (e.g., tobacco outlet exposure; area-level poverty) using geographic information system data. Principal outcomes of interest are lapse ascertained in real time through AutoSense, and early and long-term abstinence from smoking. This research would be the first to ever combine objective and dynamic indices of smoking lapse, negative affect/stress, and key environmental influences in the study of smoking cessation. The comprehensive, multi-method approach is a major advance for the field as it eliminates problems related to an exclusive reliance on self-report for key outcomes and predictors. In addition, this is one off the first studies to include empirically based machine learning approaches to fully mine the voluminous body of data yielded by real time assessment approaches, and to include the framework of dynamic prediction models, a novel statistical approach. The results will inform the tailoring of policies and interventions targeted at reducing the profound smoking-related disparities experienced by AAs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Real-time, field-based, state of the science methodologies will be used to examine the influence of demographics and social history, biobehavioral/psychosocial predispositions, contextual and environmental influences, and acute momentary precipitants on smoking lapse and abstinence among 300 African American smokers attempting to quit.",Eliminating Tobacco-Related Disparities amount African American Smokers,9851750,R01MD010362,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' indexing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' Poverty ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Volition ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Letters ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' interest ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' wireless ', ' Wireless Technology ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' demographics ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' public health relevance ', ' mindfulness ', ' distress tolerance ', ' social health determinants ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' built environment ', ' BD2K ', ' Big Data to Knowledge ', ' data into knowledge ', ' data to knowledge ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' body sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' wearable sensor ', ' wearable system ', ' wireless sensor technology ', ' wearable sensor technology ', ' smoking abstinence ', ' Infrastructure ', ' social cohesion ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,849960,0.2244692431251016
"Promoting Smoking Cessation among Individuals With Food Insecurity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite overall declines in the prevalence of cigarette smoking, smoking remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death. Smoking prevalence is also disproportionately concentrated among population groups that are economically disadvantaged, contributing to an uneven burden of tobacco-related health problems. Socioeconomic disparities in tobacco use persist largely because economically disadvantaged smokers are less likely to succeed in quitting than non-economically disadvantaged smokers. Many economically disadvantaged smokers are motivated to quit, but various life stressors pose significant barriers to cessation. One of the most stressful conditions in the experience of poverty is food insecurity, or the inability to afford adequate and appropriate foods needed to live an active and healthy life. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that food insecurity is independently associated with increased odds of smoking. However, proximal factors linking food insecurity and smoking are not well understood, and research has not extended this association towards informing cessation. Extant literature suggests that there are shared psychological (e.g., stress) and physiological (e.g., hunger) factors that may predispose food insecure smokers to encountering difficulties with quitting smoking. The overall goal of this proposal is to build the candidate's research expertise on the intersection of food insecurity, smoking, and quitting. This award will support the candidate's career development as a social and health psychologist whose research addresses social determinants of health to promote smoking cessation among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. The career development plan includes advanced training and mentorship in (1) social epidemiology, (2) qualitative research methods, (3) food insecurity and nutrition policy, and (4) smoking cessation intervention research. Aim 1 of the proposed study will determine whether the experience of food insecurity is associated with continued smoking among a nationally representative sample of low-income smokers, using extant longitudinal data from the 2001-2013 Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Aim 2 will target a subset of the local population with food insecurity—individuals seeking federal food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in San Francisco, California—to conduct surveys and in-depth interviews on the lived experience of food insecurity and its association with smoking behaviors and quitting. Aim 3 will develop and pilot test a smoking cessation outreach program that is delivered to 100 smokers with food insecurity in the context of SNAP, which provides a novel venue for smoking cessation and health promotion research. Taken together, this research and training plan will lay the foundation for a planned community-based randomized controlled trial of a smoking cessation intervention targeting households with food insecurity. This work has the potential to inform reductions in tobacco-related health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will identify how a key aspect of socioeconomic stress—the experience of food insecurity—is associated with smoking behaviors and smoking cessation among smokers who are economically disadvantaged. This study will also develop a smoking cessation promotion outreach program that is delivered in the context of a federal nutrition assistance program. Taken together, this research has the clear potential to address disproportionately high rates of smoking in economically disadvantaged populations by leveraging existing social service infrastructures for smoking cessation and health promotion.",Promoting Smoking Cessation among Individuals With Food Insecurity,9989825,K01DA043659,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Household ', ' Hunger ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' nutrition ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychologist ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' San Francisco ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' base ', ' career ', ' community planning ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Development Plans ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Nutrition Policy ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' Smoker ', ' nonsmoker ', ' non-smoker ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' underclass ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' outreach ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' psychological distress ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Population Group ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Training ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Smoking and Health ', ' Smoking and Health Research ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' pilot trial ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' safety net ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' evidence base ', ' social health determinants ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Secure ', ' food environment ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' panel study of income dynamics ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' secondary analysis ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' food insecurity ', ' social epidemiology ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIDA,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,163971,0.1549178453754755
"Small Financial Incentives to Promote Smoking Cessation in Safety Net Hospital Patients ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. Although the prevalence of smoking has declined to 18.1 percent among U.S. adults, 27.9 percent of those living in poverty report current smoking. Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking cessation. There is mounting evidence that offering incentives for abstinence (i.e., Contingency Management [CM]) may be an effective approach for promoting short-term smoking cessation, though few studies have demonstrated longer-term effectiveness. In addition, little attention has been paid to socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers specifically (e.g., safety- net hospital populations) in CM intervention studies. Our preliminary work indicates that offering small escalating financial incentives for smoking abstinence dramatically increases short-term cessation rates among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers when incentives are included as an adjunct to standard clinic- based smoking cessation treatment. However, additional work is needed to evaluate the influence of this CM approach in the longer-term with a rigorous and adequately powered trial. Thus, the aims of the proposed study are to: 1) evaluate the longer-term impact of an adjunctive, low-cost CM intervention (relative to usual care) on smoking abstinence rates among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals participating in a safety-net hospital smoking cessation program, and 2) identify treatment mechanisms and contextual factors associated with cessation outcomes among intervention participants using both traditional and ecological momentary assessment approaches. Participants seeking smoking cessation treatment at an urban safety net hospital (N = 320) will be randomly assigned to 1) usual care (UC; n = 160) or 2) UC plus financial incentives for biochemically-confirmed abstinence (CM; n = 160). Those randomized to the CM intervention will have the opportunity to earn small gift cards for biochemically-verified abstinence through 12 weeks post-quit. Specifically, participants may earn $20 for abstinence on the quit date, and this amount will increase by $5 with each successive abstinent visit through 4 weeks post-quit ($150 total). Participants may additionally earn $50 gift cards for abstinence at 8 and 12 weeks post-quit. Biochemically-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks post-quit (longer-term abstinence) will be the primary outcome variable, though smoking status will be assessed at all visits. We also hope to gain a better understanding of CM treatment mechanisms and to identify other factors that directly influence cessation via traditional questionnaire and smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment approaches. Smartphone technology allows for ""real-time"" data collection to more accurately capture important cessation-related variables, and will be used to deliver gain-framed messages to support and strengthen the CM intervention. Findings will provide insight about new treatment targets for intervention research, and will demonstrate an effective, inexpensive, and easily implementable means by which to improve longer-term smoking cessation rates among economically disadvantaged smokers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking cessation. Offering incentives for abstinence is an effective approach for promoting short-term smoking cessation, though the longer-term effectiveness of this approach has not been established and little attention has been paid to socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers.

"Project RESIST: Increasing Resistance to Tobacco Marketing Among Young Adult Sexual Minority Women Using Inoculation Message Approaches Young adult sexual minority women (SMW), including lesbians and bisexuals, are at particularly high risk, with up to 4.8 times increased odds of cigarette smoking than heterosexual women; up to 660,000 young adult SMW smoke and are at increased risks of smoking-related cancers and cardiopulmonary illnesses. Exposure to tobacco industry marketing, minority stressors, alcohol and drug use and social determinants are key factors linked to increased smoking behavior in this population. Anti-smoking campaigns utilized inoculation messages (analogous to vaccines) and culturally-tailoring (i.e., LGBT imagery, symbols, and language) to promote resilience against tobacco marketing influences among LGBT audiences. However, the effects of culturally tailored inoculation approaches in young adult SMW have not yet been examined. Our long-term goal is to eliminate smoking-related health disparities among LGBTQ populations. The objectives of this study are to determine the effects of using a culturally-tailored inoculation approach to increase resilience to tobacco marketing influences among young adult SMW and obtain stakeholders’ critical inputs that support later adoption and implementation. These objectives are directly responsive to the priorities of PAR-18-559 for behavioral research in cancer prevention and control, development and testing of interventions addressing tobacco use, and communication aimed at altering tobacco use. Our central hypothesis is that culturally tailored inoculation messages will be more effective versus non-tailored messages to increase resilience to tobacco marketing. The scientific premise for this work is supported by 1) campaigns promoting resilience against tobacco companies and smoking among LGBTQ audiences, 2) our pilot study showing young adult SMW perceive higher relevance, favorable attitudes, and positive emotions toward LGBTQ imagery compared to control imagery, and 3) an integrative conceptual framework informed by communication science, minority stress and resilience framework among SMW. Our specific aims are: 1) Engage with key stakeholders to optimize message construction and collect pilot data to inform future intervention design, 2) Evaluate the effects of culturally tailored anti-smoking messages on young adult SMWs’ smoking and quitting intentions, and 3) Evaluate the effects of inoculation message type, dose, and latency on young adult SMWs’ resilience to tobacco marketing, smoking and quitting intentions. We will conduct twice-yearly meetings, rapid cycle feedback, field pilot testing, and key informant interviews with an Expert Advisory Committee comprising LGBT organization leaders, investigators in sexual and gender minority health, community members, and national agencies (NCI, CDC, and FDA); message development and testing using qualitative research methods; and randomized survey experiments. Impact: Findings from this study will provide the foundation to develop an evidence-based and culturally tailored inoculation approach to increase resilience to tobacco marketing among young adult SMW and that addresses the needs of future adopters and implementers. The proposed research is relevant to public health because young adult sexual minority women are disproportionately impacted by smoking-related health disparities, and research to identify effective and scalable counter-marketing approaches to reduce smoking among this priority population is limited. This research will determine the effects of inoculation with culturally-tailored counter-marketing messages to increase resistance to tobacco industry marketing, explore the impact of counter-marketing messages in relation to minority stress, resilience and social/environmental factors, and explore the mechanisms via emotions, beliefs and attitudes.

"Feasibility and Preliminary Effectiveness of a WeChat-based Smoking Cessation Intervention Targeting Chinese Immigrant Smokers PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Background: Smoking rates remain disproportionally high in Chinese Americans, particularly among male immigrants. In New York City, the current smoking rate among Chinese American men is significantly higher than the general male population (28.2% vs. 17.5%). Foreign-born Chinese Americans are more likely to smoke than their US-born counterparts. The persistently high smoking rate among Chinese Americans is largely due to two factors: low intention to quit which might be attributed to Chinese immigrants' low health literacy related to the harms of smoking and benefits of quitting, and persistent attachment to traditional Chinese social norms that continue to support smoking in men. The other factor is the low utilization of the existing available smoking cessation resources which might be explained by the lack of culturally adapted cessation treatment services targeting Chinese Americans and their access barriers to the treatment services. The fast growing use of social media represents an opportunity to overcome the access barriers to smoking cessation treatment. WeChat, the most popular social media platform among Chinese globally, is fully integrated into the daily lives of Chinese, and thereby has the potential to reach a wide audience of Chinese immigrants and promote smoking cessation. Yet, no study has explored the use of WeChat to deliver culturally adapted smoking cessation interventions targeting Chinese immigrant smokers. Research: The goal of this study is to design and evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effect of a WeChat-based multi-component smoking cessation intervention that is adapted to the cultural and social context of Chinese immigrant smokers. The intervention will consist of four components, including a fully automated bidirectional mobile messaging system (core of the intervention), infographics, narratives, and links to existing cessation treatment services that target Chinese Americans. Focus groups will be conducted to guide the adaptation of messages, infographics, and storytelling narratives. A single arm pilot test will be conducted to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. A two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted to examine the preliminary effectiveness of the intervention. Training: The training plan is built upon my research experience in tobacco control. I will receive training and mentored research experience in social media health interventions, mixed methods, health disparities, clinical trials and grant writing. The pedagogical approach includes one-on-one mentorship, formal coursework, workshop, seminars, webinars, and attendance at conferences in areas of high relevance to this project. PROJECT NARRATIVE Smoking rates remain disproportionally high in Chinese immigrants particularly among males, despite the availability of evidence-based smoking cessation treatment services targeting Chinese Americans. WeChat, the most popular social media platform among Chinese globally, is fully integrated into the daily lives of Chinese and thereby can be a powerful tool to disseminate health messages and promote healthy behavior changes. This K01 project will explore the use of WeChat to deliver a culturally adapted cessation intervention and will provide important feasibility and initial efficacy data to inform future larger trials that use social media approach for smoking cessation treatment among disadvantaged populations including Chinese immigrants.",Feasibility and Preliminary Effectiveness of a WeChat-based Smoking Cessation Intervention Targeting Chinese Immigrant Smokers,9977399,K01MD014165,"['Awareness ', ' Carbon Monoxide ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Chinese American ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Environment ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Libraries ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' New York City ', ' Paper ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Scholarship ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Writing ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' social norm ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' flyer ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Health Communication ', ' post intervention ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' tobacco control ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' treatment effect ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' evidence base ', ' arm ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' pedagogical approach ', ' pedagogical development ', ' pedagogical method ', ' pedagogical content ', ' social media ', ' webinar ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile computing ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' treatment services ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention participants ', ' ']",NIMHD,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2020,134487,0.16747199928796827
"Impact of Cigar Flavor on Tobacco Use Behaviors and Addiction in Dual Users PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The rapid increase in popularity of dual use of flavored little cigars/cigarillos (LCCs) with cigarettes among U.S. young adults has significant implications for their health, addiction, and cessation. LCCs are used for two primary reasons: their relatively lower cost and flavor offerings. As cigarettes become more expensive or less reinforcing, young adults may substitute with attractively flavored LCCs rather than quit. We do not know the addictiveness of LCCs compared with cigarettes in dual users, the role that flavors play in addiction and dual use, and if flavors are more important for women than men. Moreover, the FDA has described research on cigars and flavors as a priority. Therefore, a critical need exists to characterize the addiction potential (AP) of flavored and unflavored LCCs compared with cigarettes and differences by sex in dual users.  The specific aims are to: (1) characterize the AP of LCCs compared with cigarettes; (2) determine the extent to which the AP of LCCs varies by flavor and sex of user; and (3) determine the extent to which LCC use in the home environment differs by flavored vs. unflavored. The proposed study will employ a 3-week crossover design that combines survey-based measures (including behavioral economic assessments), biomarkers, and ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) of AP, dependence, and tobacco use behaviors among 145 non-treatment-seeking young adult (18-34 years old) dual users. AP will be characterized by behavioral economic indices of demand, such as the hypothetical consumption of LCCs at escalating prices, and other standardized measures of addiction. The impact of flavors on LCC and cigarette smoking at home will be captured by EMA. This information will address the following FDA priorities: impact of changes in LCC flavors on dependence and dual use behaviors, and innovative methods to assess tobacco use behaviors.  The career development plan combines mentored hands-on training with coursework and professional development activities to meet the objectives critical to my transition to independent tobacco regulatory scientist. My career goal is to conduct research that develops our understanding of tobacco use in vulnerable populations, and informs tobacco regulation to reduce disease. I propose additional training in addictions research (including clinical trials), measurement of dependence and addiction potential, cigar regulatory research, and grantsmanship. With this training and my prior experience, I will be able to transition to an independent investigator of tobacco product flavorings and other characteristics that—with cognitive, affective, behavioral, and environmental influences—contribute to their uptake, use, and addiction. UConn Health, Brown, and Rutgers provide excellent resources for my career development, including formal coursework, seminars, expert faculty, research centers, office space, equipment, software, and data collection, analysis, and management resources. The focused training provided by this Award represents the final step in my career development and provides preliminary data and training for planned R-level grant writing. PROJECT NARRATIVE The dual use of little cigars/cigarillos (LCCs) and cigarettes is a significant public health concern for young adults' health and tobacco addiction. Among young adult dual users, this study compares the addiction potential of LCCs to cigarettes and determines if flavors enhance the addiction and if women are especially susceptible.

"In Vivo Experience with NRT to Increase Adherence and Smoking Abstinence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking remains the leading cause of death and disability in the United States, resulting in death for 1 out of every 2 smokers. While smoking rates have declined to about 18% among the general population, smoking rates still remain disproportionately high among individuals in the criminal justice system (i.e., 70-80%). Despite this high rate of smoking, few interventions have been tested in this population. We were the first to investigate providing 12 weeks of bupropion to a sample of community corrections smokers and then randomizing them to either four sessions of smoking cessation counseling or no counseling to quit. No significant differences were found between our two groups, indicating no additional benefit from more intensive smoking cessation counseling. However, while only 5.8% were abstinent at the 6 month follow-up, abstinence rates were quadrupled among the minority of those who were adherent to medication. Developing interventions to increase medication adherence has been cited as the most important means to reducing disparities; however, the few interventions that have investigated increasing adherence have been psychoeducational only and have yielded poor results. But evidence from our previous work demonstrated that smokers who had previous experience using bupropion had higher subsequent cessation rates and this relationship was mediated by improved medication adherence. Thus, exposure to medication is very likely the critical factor in improving subsequent adherence. The current application proposes a randomized controlled trial to maximize medication adherence with this population of smokers by testing an In Vivo NRT experiential intervention. Participants randomized to the In Vivo intervention will try a nicotine patch in Session 1, try nicotine gum in Session 2, try combination nicotine replacement therapy (cNRT) in Session 3, and discuss any problems with use of cNRT for a quit attempt in Session 4. During each 30-minute session they will discuss their expectations for the medication as well as the In Vivo session effects of these medications on withdrawal symptomatology, including urge to smoke. Between sessions, participants will be given medication to use during that week to make practice quit attempts and to become familiar with the medication. Participants randomized to the control group will receive four 30-minute sessions of standard behavioral counseling. All participants will receive cNRT for 10 weeks. Follow-ups will occur up to six months post-intervention. Primary outcomes include 6 month point prevalence abstinence and abstinence across time as well as medication adherence. If successful, this intervention could provide an easily transportable, novel, and tailored intervention to increase medication adherence and improve smoking cessation rates among smokers in the criminal justice system to reduce health disparities and save lives. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Smoking is now concentrated in high risk and disadvantaged populations such as individuals in the criminal justice system.

"ASPiRE: Advancing Science & Practice in the Retail Environment Center Summary/Abstract  New population-based interventions to restrict the sales and distribution of tobacco products are increasingly common at the local level, despite little systematic research on these efforts. The retail environment – comprised of the built environment (retailer quantity and location) and consumer environment (price, product availability, and promotion at the point of sale) – is a critical emerging opportunity for tobacco control. The overall goal of the Advancing Science and Practice in the Retail Environment (ASPiRE) Program Project is to build a rigorous, scientific evidence base for effective tobacco control in the retail environment to reduce tobacco use, tobacco-related disparities, and the public health burdens of tobacco including tobacco- related cancers. The specific aims of ASPiRE are to: 1) fill important gaps in the evidence base about the impact of tobacco retailer density and tobacco product availability and promotion on tobacco use and tobacco- related health outcomes (e.g., cancer); 2) evaluate the potential of local retail interventions to reduce socioeconomic disparities in exposure to the tobacco retail environment and improve cessation outcomes; 3) evaluate the underlying mechanisms and effectiveness of different options for intervening in the retail environment to increase the costs of tobacco use, increase cessation, and reduce consumption; and 4) enhance community capacity to implement evidence-based tobacco control practices in retail settings.  Three innovative research projects are integral to these aims and will examine the degree to which tobacco retailer density contributes to tobacco use and tobacco-related disease over time using archival data (Project 1), evaluate the impact of local retail interventions on tobacco use outcomes using data from a longitudinal panel of tobacco users adult smokers (Project 2) and develop computational modeling to simulate community-level interventions to understand how changes in the built and consumer environments may lead to improved public health (Project 3). Each research project will produce unique and complementary scientific knowledge that will advance the retail tobacco control evidence base.  The administrative core and two shared resource cores that specialize in 1) data management and biostatistics, and 2) dissemination and implementation will enhance the impact and reach of the scientific aims and increase synergy among the research and results from the three projects. ASPiRE takes a `team science' approach and leverages a successful, enduring collaboration that was established over 5 years of previous funding from NCI's State & Community Tobacco Control Initiative (U01-CA154281). If ASPiRE achieves its aims, it will be a national resource for the emerging area of tobacco control retail science and speed translation of retail science into evidence-based community practices that will reduce the public health burden of tobacco use. Project Narrative Tobacco use causes nearly half of a million premature deaths each year from cancer, cardiovascular disease, and pulmonary illnesses. This Program Project will identify the role that tobacco retail outlets play in promoting tobacco use and causing tobacco-related illnesses. National, city-based, and computation modeling studies will specifically focus on the health impacts of where retailers are located, the types of tobacco products retailers sell, and the prices retailers charge for those products.",ASPiRE: Advancing Science & Practice in the Retail Environment,10005185,P01CA225597,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Charge ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Expenditure ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Industry ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Marketing ', ' Study models ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Peer Review ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sales ', ' Science ', ' Standardization ', ' Taxes ', ' Tobacco ', ' Translations ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' base ', ' community planning ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Training ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' tobacco company ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Location ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' consumer product ', ' data management ', ' synergism ', ' Cigarette ', ' Speed ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' tobacco-induced cancer ', ' tobacco-related cancer ', ' Tobacco-Related Carcinoma ', ' Data ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' tobacco control ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' exposure to tobacco ', ' tobacco exposure ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Consumption ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' community based practice ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' clean indoor air law ', ' smoke-free air law ', ' smoke-free air policy ', ' smokefree air law ', ' smokefree policy ', ' smoke-free policy ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' built environment ', ' data library ', ' data archive ', ' tobacco user ', ' tobacco products ', ' Computerized Models ', ' computational modeling ', ' computational models ', ' computer based models ', ' computerized modeling ', ' Computer Models ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,P01,2020,1242249,0.1608681134374394
"The Impact of Cigar Pack Quantity on Tobacco Use Behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY This K01 application is designed to provide Jessica King, PhD, with the mentored training necessary to transition into an independent tobacco regulatory science researcher. Dr. King will be mentored by a team of renowned tobacco control and tobacco regulatory scientists and will complete mentored training, coursework, and professional development in the areas of advanced statistical analyses, policy impact analyses, and health disparities. This additional career development and mentorship will directly contribute to completing the proposed research strategy, which examines the impact of cigar pack quantity on tobacco use behaviors. Cigar use is the third most commonly used tobacco product among adults, and second most commonly used product among youth, with use increasing among low income, minority, and young adult populations. Given the significant health effects attributable to cigar use, this represents a critical health disparity. Low cost is often cited as a reason for increased use among these populations, in part due to low taxes and varying pack quantities. Research on cigarettes has shown minimum pack quantity laws increase price and decrease use. As of 2016, the FDA has regulatory authority over cigars, allowing it to regulate the marketing, manufacturing, and distribution of cigar products, including mandating minimum pack quantities. However, cigar-specific data are needed to inform FDA's regulation. Thus, the goal of the proposed analyses are to advance understanding of the relationship between cigar pack quantity and tobacco use behaviors to inform regulation on minimum cigar pack quantity. Specifically, we aim to (1) assess whether cigar pack quantity is associated with between- and within-person changes in cigar use and whether there are differences by sociodemographic factors, (2-3) identify the impact of local minimum cigar pack quantity laws on cigar and other tobacco use and cigar sales and whether impacts differ across communities of varying demographics, and (4) characterize differences in the implementation and enforcement of minimum cigar pack quantity laws through qualitative interviews with key implementation personnel. In this mixed-methods approach, we will utilize national datasets, including the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study, the Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey, the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, and Nielsen retail scanner data. Each aim will explicitly examine the impact among racial and ethnic minorities, low income populations, youth, and young adults, each vulnerable populations. This research will directly address the FDA Center for Tobacco Products Scientific Domains of behavior and impact analysis. The findings from this study may inform future FDA rulemaking on cigar pack quantity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cigar use is a significant public health concern, particularly among vulnerable populations.

"A randomized controlled trial to support smoke-free policy compliance in public housing Project Summary Tobacco use remains a leading cause of preventable premature death in the United States, especially for racial/ethnic minorities and low-income populations. Public and multiunit housing are closely tied to tobacco- related disparities as vulnerable populations are most likely to live in multiunit housing with the highest rates of smoking and secondhand smoke exposure, while also the least likely to have access to smoke-free home environments. For example, New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) residents smoke at higher rates, report higher secondhand smoke exposure from an outside source and are surrounded by high density tobacco retail environments compared to other New Yorkers. Public housing is at the forefront of the smoke-free policy movement. In 2016, HUD mandated that all housing authorities adopt smoke-free policies, which affects all 3,300 housing authorities and 1.2 million households nationwide. NYCHA is the largest public housing provider in the nation; it houses more than 400,000 people in 326 public housing developments spanning over 2,400 buildings citywide. As of July 2018, all NYCHA housing units adopted a smoke-free policy affecting all properties. The implementation of this policy, the largest of its kind, represents a critical opportunity to examine and reduce public housing-related tobacco hazards. To date, no randomized controlled trials (RCT) have been conducted to test the effects of compliance strategies on resident smoking behavior and secondhand smoke exposure. The proposed design will be a borough-stratified, four-arm, factorial-design, cluster RCT that will target 128 randomly selected buildings (32 buildings per arm) in separate NYCHA developments. We will recruit and follow 8 randomly selected residents stratified by smoking status- 4 smokers and 4 non-smokers- per building (n=1024) into four arms: (1) relocation/cessation, (2) resident endorsement, (3) relocation/ cessation plus resident endorsement and (4)the standard approach (256 participants per arm). Outcomes will be assessed longitudinally using salivary cotinine and resident surveys to measure smoking behaviors and secondhand smoke exposures at 4 time points: baseline, 2, 6 and 12 months post-intervention. Qualitative data will also be collected via key informant interviews, focus groups and sensory observations of buildings. This mixed methods, pre-post with comparison RCT design overseen by a highly experienced, interdisciplinary team in partnership with NYCHA and a stakeholder advisory board. Aims include to experimentally test if policy compliance interventions reduce personal smoking behavior (Aim 1); reduce secondhand smoke exposure (Aim 2), and determine if the tobacco retail environment surrounding each building moderates the relationship between compliance interventions and smoking-related outcomes (Aim 3). This comprehensive, community engaged and social-ecologically informed RCT supports the design and implementation of interventions to optimize smoke-free housing compliance for populations with high burdens of tobacco-related disparities. Project Narrative Smoke-free housing policies in multiunit housing are promising and increasingly widespread interventions to reduce smoking and secondhand smoke exposure. Little research has identified factors that impede compliance with smoke-free housing policies in low-income multiunit housing and test corresponding solutions. The proposed RCT addresses key gaps in knowledge and capitalizes on key scientific opportunities by: 1) leveraging the federal mandate to ban smoking in a public housing system of more than sufficient size to conduct an adequately powered RCT; 2) expanding our understanding of smoke-free policy compliance beyond policy implementation by testing two novel treatments: a) in-residence smoking cessation and b) resident endorsement, while 3) addressing population and location-specific tobacco-related disparities.",A randomized controlled trial to support smoke-free policy compliance in public housing,10039272,R01CA240555,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Biological Monitoring ', ' Biologic Monitoring ', ' biomonitoring ', ' Communities ', ' Cotinine ', ' Scotine ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Household ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Public Housing ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sales ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Passive Smoking ', ' involuntary smoking ', ' second hand smoking ', ' secondhand smoking ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Health Benefit ', ' density ', ' Area ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Policies ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' nonsmoker ', ' non-smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Salivary ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Sensory ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Policy Compliance ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' authority ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' second-hand smoke ', ' second-hand tobacco smoke ', ' secondhand smoke ', ' secondhand tobacco smoke ', ' environmental tobacco smoke ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Smoking Status ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' post intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' nonsmoking ', ' non-smoking ', ' high risk ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' arm ', ' clean indoor air law ', ' smoke-free air law ', ' smoke-free air policy ', ' smokefree air law ', ' smokefree policy ', ' smoke-free policy ', ' smoke-free housing ', ' smokefree home ', ' smokefree housing ', ' Smoke-free home ', ' Passive Smoke Exposure ', ' exposure to ETS ', ' exposure to SHS ', ' exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to tobacco smoke ', ' second hand smoke exposure ', ' secondhand smoke exposure ', ' environmental tobacco smoke exposure ', ' trial design ', ' social media ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' recruit ', ' preventable mortality ', ' preventable death ', ' tobacco products ', ' ventilation ', ' ']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,672219,0.09558301853247161
"Addressing Psychological Risk Factors Underlying Smoking Persistence in COPD Patients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is caused primarily by smoking and smoking cessation is the first-line treatment for slowing disease progression. Despite this, nearly 50% of COPD patients continue to smoke following diagnosis. Smokers with COPD report high rates of co-occurring conditions – nicotine dependence, depression, and anxiety – which serve as barriers to quitting. The proposed research will develop and pilot test a behavioral intervention designed to target the common psychological factors underlying these co-occurring conditions and foster smoking cessation among COPD patients.  Primary aims of the proposed research are to: 1) Refine behavioral treatment components through qualitative interviews with patients and providers, 2) Develop a tailored behavioral treatment to address psychological risk factors among COPD patients using single case design experiments, and 3) Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effects of the multi-component intervention on smoking outcome, as compared to minimally-enhanced usual care. The proposed project will be the first to adapt a behavioral treatment to specifically target psychological risk factors among COPD patients who smoke. By addressing core psychological risk factors, the behavioral treatment may help buffer against stress associated with disease progression and increase COPD patients' exercise tolerance, engagement in pulmonary rehabilitation, and quality of life. Thus, this intervention has potential to obviate a large number of health burdens among COPD patients, and ultimately to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with COPD.  Amanda Mathew, PhD, a Research Assistant Professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, is seeking five years of support through the K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award for training and research related to development and testing of smoking cessation interventions targeted to psychological risk factors among COPD patients. Dr. Mathew's overarching career goals are to elucidate the mechanisms by which psychological factors impact cigarette smoking, develop novel interventions for smokers with medical and psychiatric comorbidities, and reduce tobacco-related health disparities. Through the proposed training plan, Dr. Mathew will expand her knowledge and skills related to intervention development; behavioral RCT design, conduct, and analysis; and smoking cessation and treatment needs specific to individuals with COPD. Dr. Mathew's multidisciplinary mentorship team has demonstrated expertise in these content areas, and is committed to Dr. Mathew's career development. Dr. Mathew's proposed work is also well-aligned with behavioral medicine research priorities within the Department of Preventive Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Although individuals diagnosed with COPD have high rates of nicotine dependence, depression, and anxiety, there is very limited understanding of the psychological risk factors that commonly drive these conditions and how they can be addressed through targeted treatment. The proposed research will develop and test a novel smoking cessation intervention among COPD patients and use qualitative data from patients and providers to guide treatment delivery.

"Modeling the public health impact of a national menthol cigarette ban. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States. More than one-third of smokers in the United States use menthol cigarettes. Menthol cigarettes are of particular public health concern because they make it easier for adolescents to initiate smoking and are more difficult to quit than non-menthol cigarettes. In addition, menthol cigarettes are disproportionately used by youth, low-income and racial/ethnic minority smokers. In 2011 the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC), a Congressionally mandated committee assembled to advise the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), reported that “removal of menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health in the United States.” Despite TPSAC’s conclusion, the FDA has not banned menthol cigarettes. Instead, the FDA has requested additional research to inform regulatory action. The objective of this project is to use microsimulation modeling to estimate the impact of a national menthol cigarette ban on tobacco use and tobacco-related disease, specifically cardiovascular disease (CVD) and tobacco-related cancers. This research would inform potential FDA regulatory action on menthol cigarettes. The project has three aims. Aim 1 identifies trajectories of cigarette use over time using longitudinal, nationally representative survey data. To achieve this aim, I will use Markov chains to compute transition probabilities of tobacco use behavior (frequency, intensity, flavor preference) over time. Aim 2 systematically reviews and meta-analyzes studies examining the effects of menthol cigarette bans on tobacco product use. This will be the first review to synthesize the literature on the impact of a menthol cigarette ban, providing critical information for microsimulation modeling. Aim 3 builds a microsimulation model of smoking and tobacco-related disease to estimate the impact of a national menthol cigarette ban on smoking, CVD, and tobacco-related cancers. I will establish parameters for the model using the best epidemiological evidence and conduct sensitivity analyses to test the validity of the model. Finally, I will estimate the change in smoking, CVD, and tobacco-related cancers that would occur in the total population and in specific socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups if a menthol cigarette ban were implemented. I hypothesize that a national menthol cigarette ban will reduce socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in smoking, CVD, and tobacco-related cancers. The career development award will help me achieve my goal of becoming an independent tobacco control and health disparities researcher. I will receive the training and mentorship needed to build an independent research program focused on the role tobacco control policy may play in improving the public’s health, in particular among groups that disproportionately suffer from smoking and tobacco-related disease. This award will culminate in an application for an R01 grant to expand upon my microsimulation model, comparing the impacts of additional tobacco control policies on smoking and disease.

"Expanding the Reach of a Validated Smoking-Cessation Intervention: A Spanish-language RCT ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco smoking is the leading preventable cause of cancer mortality. Pharmacotherapy and behavioral counseling have demonstrated independent and additive effects toward aiding smoking cessation; however, counseling is rarely chosen by smokers. In contrast, minimal self-help interventions, such as smoking cessation pamphlets or booklets have much wider potential reach, yet their efficacy has been largely disappointing, with incremental abstinence rates averaging only 1 percent. Given the high dissemination potential, any significant improvement in the efficacy of self-help would have high public health impact with respect to smoking and smoking related illness and mortality. In contrast to traditional self-help, a notable exception to the historically poor efficacy of self-help has been extended self-help that provides evidence-based content over a prolonged period of time. A recently completed trial of such an intervention, comprising 18 months of contact with a written social support component, revealed high efficacy throughout the 24-month follow-up period, as well as high cost- effectiveness. Wide-scale implementation and public health impact would be enhanced by the availability of a Spanish-language version to reach the largest and fastest growing ethnic minority population of smokers. The current smoking prevalence among Hispanic/Latino adults varies by cultural subgroup, with prevalence above 30 percent, for example, among those of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent. Greater smoking prevalence is also associated with lower income and education, and greater US acculturation. Prior research has demonstrated that Hispanic/Latino smokers face unique challenges such as lower awareness and acceptability of pharmacotherapies and less assistance with smoking cessation from their health providers. The goal of this study is to address this gap in cessation by conducting a randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of a culturally appropriate Spanish-language version of the existing validated self-help intervention. The efficacy of this intervention will be tested against two control conditions. The first, Usual Care, will consist of a traditional self-help intervention in Spanish. The second, Contact Control, will match the novel intervention on time and contact. These two control conditions address external and internal validity, respectively. It is hypothesized that, compared to both the Usual Care and the Contact Control conditions, the intervention will produce higher abstinence rates throughout 24 months of outcome assessment. Potential moderator variables will be evaluated to guide further refinement and targeting of the intervention. This would be the first study to test a Spanish-language adaptation of a validated self-help smoking cessation intervention in a nation-wide RCT. If efficacy is demonstrated in this study, a low-cost, easily disseminated, evidence-based intervention would be available, with the potential to reduce ethnic health disparities associated with tobacco smoking. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Research is needed to develop and validate interventions for ethnic minority smokers. The aim of the proposed study is to test a Spanish-language adaptation of a validated and easily implemented self-help intervention in a nation-wide clinical trial. Efforts aimed at promoting tobacco abstinence among this underserved population could have significant public health implications, including the potential reduction of ethnic health disparities associated with tobacco smoking.",Expanding the Reach of a Validated Smoking-Cessation Intervention: A Spanish-language RCT,9987552,R01CA199143,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Awareness ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology) ', ' Conditional Variables ', ' Epidemiologic Effect Modifiers ', ' Moderator Variables ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Language ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Booklets ', ' Brochures ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco Dependence ', ' tobacco addiction ', ' tobacco dependent ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Outcome Assessment ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Letters ', ' Clinical Practice Guideline ', ' Smoker ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' Tobacco smoking behavior ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' self help ', ' trait ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disease recurrence prevention ', ' disorder recurrence prevention ', ' recurrence prevention ', ' relapse prevention ', ' disorder later incidence prevention ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Dominican ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' High Prevalence ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' tobacco abstinence ', ' cost ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Abstinence ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' smoking intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' efficacy testing ', ' smoking relapse ', ' arm ', ' Preventable cancer cause ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' Cuban ', ' racial minority ', ' recruit ', ' intervention cost ', ' compare intervention ', ' comparison intervention ', ' ']",NCI,H.

"Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs PROJECT SUMMARY Tobacco is the leading cause of preventable death and disease and is linked to ~20 cancers. Marginalized women (e.g., racial/ethnic, low socioeconomic status, or sexual and gender minorities) may be more vulnerable to environmental, social, and contextual stressors that are significant barriers to tobacco abstinence. To improve the fundamental understanding of how sex and gender relate to health behaviors and disease prevention, it is critical to use approaches that can identify meaningful intersections of social determinants and how these shape experiences and health behaviors in subpopulations of understudied, underrepresented, and underreported of women. Intersectionality posits that social identities interact with one another and with social/contextual factors to create inequities. Thus, intersectionality is useful for shifting focus from broad sectors of the population (e.g., all female smokers) to groups with intersecting statuses that may confer greater health risk (e.g., low income racial/ethnic minority females). Moreover, intersectionality reflects both between- and within-person processes. The latter highlights that the complex factors (e.g., experiences of discrimination, encountering tobacco-facilitative environments) that may influence tobacco use are dynamic and may change depending on time and context. Mobile health methodology (mHealth), such as AutoSense, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and global positioning system (GPS) provide real-time objective and subjective assessments of how and when emotions and behaviors change depending on time and context. Together, mHealth designs and an intersectionality framework may reveal the dynamic and complex factors that interact to contribute to inequities in tobacco use and cancer risk in understudied, underrepresented, and underreported women. The proposed supplement will extend the parent project (U01CA229437, MPI: Nahum- Shani, Wetter) by harmonizing data across 7 intensive longitudinal mHealth studies of tobacco cessation in 834 diverse women, which will provide adequate power for applying an intersectionality framework to understand mechanisms linking marginalized status among women to tobacco lapse and cessation outcomes. These fine- grained data can yield the most detailed investigation of intersectional process to-date, including the complex interplay between aspects of social identity (SES, race/ethnicity), social (e.g., discrimination) and contextual factors (e.g., neighborhood disadvantage, exposure to tobacco-facilitative environments), and whether these mediate the association of intersectional identities with lapse and long term abstinence. The proposed study is designed to target gaps in the understanding of inequities in tobacco use and health risk among understudied, underrepresented, and underreported subgroups of women and is directly in line with the first strategic goal of the Office of Research on Women's Health, to “advance rigorous research that will improve the fundamental understanding of how sex and gender, among other critical factors, influence health and disease.” PROJECT NARRATIVE  Evidence suggests that women may have more difficulty quitting smoking than men due to unique stressors related to the complex interplay between aspects of social identity (e.g., socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity) and social determinants such as interpersonal experiences (e.g., discrimination), social/contextual factors (e.g., social support, neighborhood disadvantages) that may influence health behavior change. This research will extend a parent grant by using a novel methodological and conceptual framework called intersectionality and cutting-edge mobile health technology (i.e., ecological momentary assessment and AutoSense) to examine how multiple aspects of sociodemographic identity, context, and interpersonal experiences interact to shape health inequities in 834 understudied, underrepresented, and underreported women. These data will improve the identification of specific populations of women at disproportionate risk for tobacco and cancer inequities and can inform the development of targeted cancer prevention interventions.",Novel use of mHealth data to identify states of vulnerability and receptivity to JITAIs,10090968,U01CA229437,"['Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Mediating ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Cancer Prevention Intervention ', ' Shapes ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' behavior change ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' tobacco abstinence ', ' exposure to tobacco ', ' tobacco exposure ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' parent grant ', ' parent project ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' health data ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' Data Analytics ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' intersectionalities ', ' intersectionality ', ' tobacco user ', ' preventable mortality ', ' preventable death ', ' Grain ', ' Global Positioning System ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' adaptive intervention ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' harmonized data ', ' data harmonization ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,214062,0.08367102538086935
"Competency-based training to advance clinical proficiencies and reduce disparities in the treatment of tobacco dependence Despite remarkable decreases in tobacco use, the benefits of tobacco control efforts are not equitably distributed. Tobacco-related disparities include a higher prevalence of daily smoking, lower rates of quitting, poorer responses to standard evidence-based treatments, less access to evidence-based treatments, variation in health care providers' delivery of tobacco treatment, and an increased burden of tobacco-related cancers and other tobacco-related diseases. Many tobacco users belong to more than one disparate group. Addressing these disparities is a high priority for cancer and tobacco control efforts. Critical barriers to reducing tobacco- related disparities include a tobacco treatment workforce unprepared to understand, assess, and treat tobacco users from disparate groups; knowledge deficits regarding the nature and impact of tobacco-related disparities; known research-to-practice gaps in the clinical proficiencies needed to treat tobacco use among disparate groups more effectively; and a unidimensional or essentialist conceptualization of the determinants that contribute to these inequities. These barriers prevent the development of personalized, relevant comprehensive tobacco treatment plans for these individuals. A unified, multidisciplinary competency-based curriculum developed by tobacco treatment disparities research, practice, and training experts and disseminated nationally would represent significant progress toward addressing these barriers. The goal of this project is to develop an innovative, competency-based Tobacco Use Treatment among Disparate Populations (TUT-DP) Training Module that will advance the proficiencies of the clinical and research workforce to meet the biomedical, behavioral, and clinical needs of groups that experience tobacco-related disparities. Experts in the field from multiple disciplines perceive a need for this resource. Among the innovative aspects of this project is the use of Intersectionality to integrate models of disparities and develop guiding principles for understanding biopsychosocial influences that produce tobacco-related disparities across disparate populations. The specific aims are: Aim One: Using a multidisciplinary team of tobacco research, practice, and training experts and an iterative process, develop a competency-based, highly disseminable TUT-DP Training Module that includes train-the-trainer resources, slides, and problem-based and experiential learning activities supported by high- quality recorded demonstration and trigger videos, a training manual, and learner evaluation instruments. Aim Two: Pilot test and refine the TUT-DP Training Module with trainers and learners from diverse professional backgrounds. Aim Three: Disseminate the TUT-DP Training Module broadly among tobacco treatment training programs and relevant professional organizations. This project is expected to have a sustained and powerful impact on the field by disseminating an innovative and engaging multidisciplinary training experience that advances clinical proficiencies and serves as an essential tool for clinical training in tobacco disparities. We will seek additional funding through the appropriate mechanism to examine the effectiveness of the TUT-DP Training Module in the next phase of this cancer education work. Project Narrative The Tobacco Use Treatment among Disparate Populations (TUT-DP) Training Module will guide the education and training of a multidisciplinary clinical workforce in how to effectively identify, assess, and treat tobacco use among disparate groups in many health care and public health settings.

"Assessing Telephone All Nations Breath of Life for Efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY AI have the highest smoking rates of all major ethnic groups in the US, at 31.8%, nearly double that of both African Americans and Whites. Despite these high rates of smoking, few researchers have addressed this issue, in part because tobacco is a sacred plant to many AI and cannot be treated completely negatively, as most smoking cessation programs do. Researchers at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) and Johnson County Community College (JCCC) have been working with regional partners using community- based participatory research (CBPR) to address recreational tobacco since 2003. We have developed a successful culturally tailored program, All Nations Breath of Life (ANBL), that respects tobacco as a sacred plant and promotes honoring it rather than abusing it recreationally. Our in-person, group-based program had an intent-to-treat quit rate of 27.9% versus 17.4% compared to current best practices at end of treatment (12 weeks) in a reservation-based efficacy trial (N=463). Cessation was 20% vs. 12% at 6 months (p=0.02). In a large urban implementation feasibility study (N=312 across five states), the quit rate was 22% at 6-months (p<0.002 compared to the highest previously reported rates for an urban AI population); retention was 71%. Based on a request from the community, we created an individual telephone-based version of the program, tANBL, which was pilot tested with N=33 individuals and had a 24.2% quit rate at 6 months, assuming those lost to follow-up as smokers. The program had an 81.8% retention rate at 6 months. We are now ready to formally test tANBL for efficacy; that is proposed here using a Bayesian Adaptive Design (BAD) and our community-based participatory research (CBPR) framework. We will address the following specific aims: (1) To compare tANBL with an individual non-tailored telephone-based comparison program (CP) using a Bayesian Adaptive Design (n=500); (2) To examine the acceptability and feasibility of implementing an individual telephone-based ANB and (3) To compare individual telephone ANBL with an individual non-tailored telephone-based comparison program using a Bayesian Adaptive Design (N=500). Our primary endpoint will be 7-day point prevalence abstinence from recreational smoking biochemically verified by salivary cotinine level at 6 months post-baseline. Quit rates in the ANBL program will be significantly better than in the non- tailored program (24% versus 10%). We will address the following secondary aims: (1) To compare tANBL and CP 30-day point prevalence and continuous abstinence rates at 6 months and 12 months post-baseline; (2) To examine individual factors such as type of pharmacotherapy (if any), level of addiction, use of other nicotine products such as e-cigarettes, quitting history, motivation, tobacco health literacy, social support, self- efficacy, ethnic identity, psychosocial health and demographic factors for effect on quit rates; (3) To maximize and assess the cultural relevance of the intervention program and all of its components and (4) To identify factors that enhance dissemination of telephone-based ANBL and contribute to program success or failure.

"Smartphone Based Smoking Cessation Intervention for Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Adults PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disease in the United States. Although multiple clinic and phone based smoking cessation treatments have been proven effective, most smoking cessation attempts are unaided and unsuccessful. Furthermore, smoking prevalence in socioeconomically disadvantaged adults is higher and cessation rates are lower than among adults with higher socioeconomic status. Previous research has indicated multiple causes of high cessation failure among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers including greater exposure to other smokers, and higher levels of stress and nicotine cravings. One recent study found that smartphone based ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) can be used to identify moments of high smoking lapse risk in the hours preceding a lapse. Specifically, EMA data were used to create a six-item smoking lapse risk estimator that identified 80% of all smoking lapses within 4 hours of the first lapse. This lapse risk estimator was included as a key component of the smartphone based Smart Treatment (Smart-T) smoking cessation app. The Smart-T app assesses risk for smoking lapse multiple times per day and automatically tailors treatment content based upon an individual's current risk for lapse and currently experienced lapse triggers. Smart-T includes other components (e.g., on demand tips for coping with cravings, stress, mood; benefits of quitting; one click call to the smoking cessation helpline; smoking cessation medication tips). The single arm Smart-T pilot study (N=59) indicated very promising 3 month biochemically verified cessation rates and analyses of EMA data indicated that tailored treatment content attenuated targeted lapse triggers. The proposed study (N=450) will compare the longer-term effects of the Smart-T smoking cessation app with the free and publically available NCI QuitGuide smoking cessation app (Aim 1). It is hypothesized that significantly more participants randomized to the Smart-T condition will be abstinent 26 weeks after a scheduled quit date than those assigned to the QuitGuide app. The second aim of the proposed study will determine if Smart-T messages that are tailored to address key smoking lapse risk variables in real- time (i.e., urge, stress, cigarette availability, cessation motivation) reduce participant ratings of these lapse risk variables compared with similar situations that do not receive this tailored content (QuitGuide group). Automated, tailored, low burden, and easily accessible interventions may be used to help socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers, a population with substantial barriers that have hampered the use of traditional smoking cessation treatments, to quit smoking. Thus, this intervention has the potential to deliver a significant public health impact to exactly those who need it most. PROJECT NARRATIVE Socioeconomically disadvantaged adults are more likely to smoke and less likely to successfully quit smoking than those of higher socioeconomic status, even when validated smoking cessation treatments are used. The proposed study will determine whether an automated smoking cessation application that tailors treatment content to the needs of socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers in real-time can reduce lapse risk and increase successful smoking cessation. By addressing lapse triggers as they arise, this type of dynamic, low burden, and always available smoking cessation app may reduce smoking lapse and thereby reduce morbidity and mortality in socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers.",Smartphone Based Smoking Cessation Intervention for Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Adults,9852575,R01CA221819,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Counseling ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Occupational Status ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Household ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' male ', ' Moods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' Oklahoma ', ' Ownership ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sensitivity Training Groups ', ' T-Groups ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Schedule ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' Biochemical ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Measurement ', ' Native Americans ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Smoker ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' experience ', ' Cigarette ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' craving ', ' nicotine craving ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Abstinence ', ' tailored messaging ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' arm ', ' customized therapy ', ' customized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized treatment ', ' patient specific therapies ', ' patient specific treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored treatment ', ' unique treatment ', ' individualized medicine ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' smartphone Application ', ' smoking abstinence ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,R01,2020,714250,0.3108208120550932
"Understanding the Impact of Marijuana and Opioid Misuse on Tobacco Dependence Treatment and Outcomes among African American Participants in a Clinical Trial ABSTRACT/SUMMARY The present application outlines a mentored career development plan to improve Dr. Erica Cruvinel's research skills and support her pursuit of a career as an independent researcher. Research Plan: African American (AA) smokers, who bear a disproportionate share of tobacco-related mortality, are poorly served by the one- shot tobacco treatment approaches that dominate research and clinical practice. The parent grant is examining the efficacy of optimized treatment (OPT), that provides smoking cessation counseling while altering the timing, sequencing, or combining of existing pharmacotherapies to maximize efficacy versus enhanced usual care (UC) treatment for smoking cessation. The central hypothesis is that OPT will result in significantly higher abstinence rates relative to UC. Additional hypotheses are that moderators, such as treatment engagement methods including medication use and counseling attendance will mediate the relationship between treatment and abstinence. Dr. Erica Cruvinel will use data collected from the parent grant to examine the impact of other drugs, including marijuana and opioid use, on counseling engagement, medication utilization, and early tobacco abstinence among study participants. This supplement will provide Dr. Cruvinel with intensive interactions with a veteran research team to develop her overall research skills and help her transition into a productive independent researcher. The proposed project will complement the parent grant moderator analysis to enhance understanding of the effectiveness of the intervention across important study subgroups. Candidate Career Development: Dr. Cruvinel will receive training in the conceptualization, implementation, and analysis of clinical trials. She will deepen her understanding of factors impacting treatment usage and cessation among low income and racial/ethnic minority smokers. She will strengthen her track record of scholarly publications and grants. Supplement support will enable her to launch a mentored research program in tobacco-related health disparities. These activities will fully prepare her for a productive, independent research career. This supplement will cover a 2-year period and includes plans for interactions with the parent grant research team, opportunities to contribute intellectually to the research, strong and supportive mentoring, and a structured career development plan. Dr. Cruvinel will accomplish these activities by becoming part of a leading team of researchers through participation on the parent R01, taking the lead on a sub-project contained within the scope of the parent grant, and through enrollment in formal courses and seminars as well as attendance at national conferences. Her plans include submission of an NIH K-series career development award application prior to the end of the supplement. The current, proposed supplement project will support her K-award application by giving her experience studying treatment adherence and increasing her understanding of important factors that can affect adherence.

"The impact of menthol and mint e-liquid bans on menthol cigarette smokers PROJECT SUMMARY Cigarette smoking contributes to nearly 30% of all cancer-related deaths.3 Menthol cigarettes comprise almost one-third of the U.S. market share and are disproportionately smoked by racial minorities.1 Tobacco control policies targeting menthol flavoring in tobacco could have significant public health outcomes, especially among black smokers. One key challenge of tobacco regulation is weighing the risks and benefits of potential policies across different populations (i.e., users and non-users).4 Tension arises between policies intended to prevent adolescent and young adult (AYA) tobacco initiation and those intended to reduce harm among current tobacco users. Specifically, menthol flavored e-liquid restrictions aimed at reducing AYA vaping may unintentionally discourage menthol cigarette smokers from switching to potentially less harmful products. E-cigarette use or vaping has increased dramatically among AYA and vaping devices with nicotine pods (e.g., JUUL) account for a large proportion of AYA use.5,6 These devices are available in many e-liquid flavors including menthol and mint, with mint being a popular flavor among AYA.2,7 The Food and Drug Administration and many states have announced intentions to limit all flavored e-liquids, including menthol and mint, in an effort to reduce AYA vaping. Alternatively, vaping devices, like JUUL, may be ideal substitution products for adult smokers who are unable to quit using nicotine. From a harm reduction perspective, moving smokers away from combusted tobacco (cigarettes) to non-combusted products (e-cigarettes) will likely result in a net positive public health impact.8 The availability of menthol e-liquids may be important for encouraging menthol cigarette smokers to switch to e- cigarettes, but mint e-liquids, which are appealing to AYA, may be unnecessary to facilitate switching. Including mint e-liquids in flavor bans but allowing menthol e-liquids to remain on the market as potential substitution products for menthol smokers may be an optimal policy approach. Behavioral economics is an ideal framework for answering this question because it applies economic constructs, such as product substitution, to individual decision-making. We are proposing a lab study and field assessment to determine how including menthol and mint e-liquids in e-liquid flavor bans or sales restrictions affects tobacco product purchasing and use among menthol cigarette smokers (N=80; 40 black, 40 white). At lab sessions, participants will complete the Experimental Tobacco Marketplace (ETM) task, a behavioral economics task in which they receive account balances to an online store and can buy menthol cigarettes at escalating costs or buy e-liquids, non-menthol cigarettes, or nicotine replacement gum at fixed costs. They will complete the task under three marketplace conditions: (1) only tobacco e-liquids available, (2) menthol and tobacco e-liquids available, and (3) menthol, mint, and tobacco e-liquids available. During a field assessment, product choice is validated by assessing use of products purchased during the ETM task. This proposal will inform policy-makers about the impact banning menthol and mint e-liquids will have on facilitating menthol cigarette smokers switching to e-cigarettes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Menthol cigarettes comprise almost one-third of the U.S. cigarette market share and are disproportionately smoked by racial minorities.1 Federal, state, and local regulatory agencies are considering banning or restricting the sales of all non-tobacco flavored e-liquids, including menthol and mint, to reduce adolescent and young adult vaping.2 This proposal will use the Experimental Tobacco Marketplace, a behavioral economics task, to determine how including menthol and mint e-liquids in e-liquid flavor bans or sales restrictions will affect tobacco product purchasing and use by menthol cigarette smokers and will provide policy-relevant information on whether including menthol in e-liquid flavor regulations may unintentionally discourage menthol cigarette smokers, especially racial minorities, from switching to potentially less harmful products.",The impact of menthol and mint e-liquid bans on menthol cigarette smokers,10046746,R03CA252767,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Candy ', ' Confection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Menthol ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Sales ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Smoker ', ' Cigarette Smoker ', ' Flavorant ', ' Flavoring Agents ', ' Flavoring ', ' Mentha ', ' Mint ', ' Genus Mentha ', ' Visit ', ' Cigarette ', ' Participant ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' tobacco policy ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Categories ', ' 12th grade ', ' high school senior ', ' twelfth grade ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Regulation ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' policy implication ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' e-cig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' ecig ', ' ecigarette ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' vaping ', ' behavioral economics ', ' racial minority ', ' nicotine consumption ', ' nicotine use ', ' tobacco user ', ' e-cig use ', ' e-cigarette use ', ' ecig use ', ' ecigarette use ', ' electronic cigarette use ', ' JUUL ', ' tobacco products ', ' e-cig liquids ', ' e-cigarette liquids ', ' e-juice ', ' e-liquid ', ' ecig liquids ', ' ecigarette liquids ', ' ejuice ', ' eliquid ', ' electronic liquid ', ' ']",NCI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R03,2020,155000,0.14508815929902427
"A Text-Based Scheduled Reduction Intervention for Smokeless Tobacco Cessation Project Summary Smokeless tobacco (chew or dip) use remains prevalent in rural and medically underserved populations, leading to increased rates of tobacco-related cancers and chronic disease. Yet, underserved tobacco users who want to quit have access to few innovative interventions. This is a significant missed opportunity to address health disparities in this group. Scheduled Gradual Reduction (SGR) may be an effective intervention to help smokeless tobacco users quit. SGR addresses common cessation challenges faced by smokeless tobacco users including the strong cue-based component of use and strong withdrawal symptoms. The SGR method been minimally studied in this population of tobacco users and represents an innovative new direction in the field. SGR involves gradually tapering smokeless tobacco use through lengthening use intervals based on an individually tailored schedule. SGR helps smokeless tobacco users learn to refrain from chew/dips that are in environmental cues by following the schedule and gradually reducing their use. Delivering SGR interventions via text messaging is an innovative way to increase the reach of this cessation intervention in underserved populations. Therefore, we propose a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a SGR Intervention (SGR intervention plus text-based support messages) vs. control intervention (text-based support messages) in decreasing smokeless tobacco use. The SGR group (N=250) will receive a six-week SGR program and text-based support messages. The control group (N=250) will receive text-based support messages. The primary outcome will be self-report smokeless tobacco cessation at 6 months. We will also test the efficacy of the text-based SGR intervention compared to support messages only on changes in withdrawal, craving, self-regulation and restraint across the 6-month period and explore whether changes in withdrawal, craving, self-regulation and restraint mediate intervention effects on self- reported cessation at 6 months post-intervention. Results of this study can be disseminated broadly to help smokeless tobacco users quit with the ultimate goal of increasing access to efficacious cessation interventions and eliminating cancer health disparities. Project Narrative Available interventions for smokeless tobacco cessation have not targeted those most at risk and have not been easily disseminated too hard to reach populations. The proposed research will efficacy of a Scheduled Gradual Reduction intervention via SMS text messaging paired with text-based counseling messages. The results of this study can be easily disseminated to rural and medically underserved smokeless tobacco users to aid in cessation, thus helping to decrease tobacco related health disparities.",A Text-Based Scheduled Reduction Intervention for Smokeless Tobacco Cessation,10003198,R01CA242593,"['Algorithms ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' Cues ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' Mastication ', ' Chewing ', ' chewed ', ' chews ', ' Medically Underserved Area ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Smokeless Tobacco ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Mediating ', ' Schedule ', ' Withdrawal Symptom ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Oral Cavity Tumor ', ' Malignant Oral Neoplasm ', ' Mouth Cancer ', ' Oral Cancer ', ' malignant mouth tumor ', ' oral cavity cancer ', ' malignant mouth neoplasm ', ' base ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' restraint ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' smokeless tobacco cessation ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically underserved population ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' tobacco-induced cancer ', ' tobacco-related cancer ', ' Tobacco-Related Carcinoma ', ' Address ', ' Smokeless ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' post intervention ', ' tobacco abstinence ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' medically underserved ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' trial design ', ' common symptom ', ' rural Americans ', ' rural underserved ', ' recruit ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' tobacco user ', ' tobacco cessation treatment ', ' tobacco cessation intervention ', ' smokeless tobacco user ', ' smokeless tobacco use ', ' compare intervention ', ' comparison intervention ', ' ']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,368288,0.15336103831910192
"Effect of Tobacco Advocacy at the State Level PROJECT SUMMARY Tobacco use remains the nation's leading cause of preventable death. The emergence of e-cigarettes and legalized marijuana use, and the increasing concentration of tobacco use among some racial and ethnic groups, poor people, people with mental illness, and young adults are all changing the environment in which tobacco control efforts take place. High quality state and local tobacco control policies and programs not only prevent tobacco use and disease, but can be an important component of health care cost containment, a key concern at all levels of government and in the private sector. The tobacco industry continues to work to stop or blunt these efforts' effectiveness. All tobacco control programs are not equally effective at reducing smoking and health care costs, making it important to quantify the effects of tobacco control policies and programs. Our research will inform the development and implementation of effective tobacco control policies and programs in this rapidly changing environment through three specific aims: 1. Identify and analyze the new challenges to state and local tobacco control policymaking and program  implementation to inform the development of effective responses to these challenges. 2. Identify policy and demographic determinants of smoking initiation, progression and cessation, including  smokefree policy coverage and cigarette taxes, as well as variation in these determinants by race/ethnicity  and socioeconomic status. 3. Quantify the magnitude and quality of tobacco control program spending across states and the relationship  between associated changes in smoking behavior and healthcare expenditures. We will pursue Aim 1 through a series of detailed case studies of the development and effects of state tobacco control policies and programs on tobacco use. For Aim 2 we will merge national datasets, beginning with the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, with policy data on clean indoor air laws, tobacco taxes, price and demographic variables to develop new models of smoking behavior that will provide a framework for better understanding how these policies affect individual behavior and health disparities. We will pursue Aim 3 using modern econometric methods to quantify the effects of state tobacco control programs, allowing for differences in program effectiveness on smoking behavior and, in turn, the effects of both smoking and tobacco control programs on health care costs. This more sophisticated understanding of what tobacco control policies and programs are most effective, together with understanding the tobacco industry's evolving efforts to block these policies, will help public health professionals develop, implement, and defend effective tobacco control policies and strategies that respond to this changing environment.   PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death, accounting for 1/3 of all cancer deaths and 540,000 deaths annually. Reducing this burden requires understanding the health impact (including on associated healthcare costs) of different tobacco control programs and policies as well as how the tobacco industry works to block these efforts and maintain a favorable environment to promote tobacco use. This research will inform health authorities on how to use increasingly limited resources most efficiently to prevent tobacco use and promote cessation.",Effect of Tobacco Advocacy at the State Level,9893866,R01DA043950,"['Accounting ', ' Aerosols ', ' Affect ', ' Air ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cost Control ', ' Cost Containment ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Laws ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Nicotine ', ' Private Sector ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Smoking ', ' Taxes ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Work ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Businesses ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Advocacy ', ' improved ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Shapes ', ' tobacco company ', ' Tobacco Industry ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' interest ', ' authority ', ' Cigarette ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' tobacco policy ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' second-hand smoke ', ' second-hand tobacco smoke ', ' secondhand smoke ', ' secondhand tobacco smoke ', ' environmental tobacco smoke ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Legal ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Smoking and Health ', ' Smoking and Health Research ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' tobacco control ', ' prevent tobacco use ', ' tobacco use prevention ', ' tobacco prevention ', ' Population ', ' clean indoor air law ', ' smoke-free air law ', ' smoke-free air policy ', ' smokefree air law ', ' smokefree policy ', ' smoke-free policy ', ' FSPTCA ', ' Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act ', ' e-cig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' ecig ', ' ecigarette ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' cannabis legalization ', ' legal marijuana ', ' legalized cannabis ', ' legalized marijuana ', ' marijuana legalization ', ' THC co-use ', ' THC use ', ' Tetrahydrocannabinol co-use ', ' Tetrahydrocannabinol use ', ' cannabis use ', ' marijuana use ', ' tribal lands ', ' National Longitudinal Survey of Youth ', ' preventable mortality ', ' preventable death ', ' e-cig use ', ' e-cigarette use ', ' ecig use ', ' ecigarette use ', ' electronic cigarette use ', ' econometrics ', ' tobacco products ', ' ']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,557063,0.21564291047954182
"Text2QuitPLUS: A Text-based Smoking Cessation Intervention for Sexual and Gender Minority Groups ABSTRACT Smoking among sexual and gender minority (SGM) groups, which include lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals, has been reported from different sources as highly prevalent (46% for gay men and 48% for lesbians). Considering that the smoking rate within SGM groups is more than double that of the general population (19%) and that smoking accounts for at least 30% of all cancer deaths, it is clear that there is an increased risk for SGM individuals to suffer from this fatal condition. Text messaging programs have been found to be effective for smoking cessation and other health behaviors. They are appealing to traditionally hard- to-reach, at-risk populations who experience barriers to smoking cessation interventions, and who have high rates of mobile phone and text messaging use, which is the case for SGM users. Text2Quit is a smoking cessation intervention that sends tailored, supportive texts to users based on self-selected smoking quit date. Although this program has been successfully evaluated with the general population in a randomized trial and has been also tailored to pregnant women, no study has evaluated its feasibility specifically among SGM smokers. I propose 3 specific aims: (1) To develop and evaluate the design of Text2QuitPLUS, an SGM-tailored version of Text2Quit, through a qualitative approach among 16 SGM adult smokers; (2) To examine recruitment, retention, and smoking abstinence rates at 1, 3, and 6 months of follow-up among 80 SGM smokers randomized to either the original Text2Quit or Text2QuitPLUS program arms. Engagement with the programs will be also measured by calculating the number of text message responses for each SGM participant from the system records; (3) To conduct mixed-method research among 32 SGM smokers completing their participation in the feasibility trial to better understand study participants' acceptability of the cessation interventions. Results will contribute to reducing tobacco-related health disparities among SGM groups. Irene Tami-Maury, D.M.D., M.Sc., Dr.P.H., a Latina scientist appointed as a Research Assistant Professor (non-tenure track) at The University of Texas MD Anderson, is seeking 3 years of support through an NCI K22 Transition Career Development Award to Promote Diversity for the proposed transition career development plan and research. In order to fill critical gaps in her experience, she will obtain specialized training, expert advice, and first-hand experience in implementing behavioral interventions targeting underserved populations, mHealth, and advanced statistics for analyzing longitudinal data. She will also expand her knowledge and skills related to tobacco cessation, SGM health disparities, and research ethics. Dr. Tami-Maury's comprehensive training and research plans, supported by an advisory committee of established researchers in the field, will secure her long-term goal of establishing anindependently funded research program in cancer prevention and tobacco cessation, with a focus on reducing tobacco-related health disparities for SGM individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Due to significantly higher prevalence of tobacco use attributed to psychosocial stressors unique to sexual and gender minority groups, implementing targeted and tailored smoking cessation interventions for this vulnerable population is crucial to reduce cancer risk. Phone text messaging is appealing to traditionally hard-to-reach, at- risk populations who experience barriers to smoking cessation interventions, particularly to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals, who report high rates of mobile phone and text messaging. Stronger evidence is needed regarding the best text-messaging interventions to support cessation efforts among sexual and gender minority smokers for ultimately reducing the burden of tobacco-related health disparities in this vulnerable group.",Text2QuitPLUS: A Text-based Smoking Cessation Intervention for Sexual and Gender Minority Groups,9892820,K22CA237639,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Career Mobility ', ' career advancement ', ' career transition ', ' Censuses ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cotinine ', ' Scotine ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Festival ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' New York ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Saliva ', ' Smoking ', ' statistics ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Training ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Individual ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Development Plans ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Funding ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Test Result ', ' psychosocial ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' professor ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Research Ethics ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Data ', ' M.D. ', ' Doctor of Medicine ', ' High Prevalence ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transition Career Development Award ', ' Transition Career Development Award (K22) ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' digital ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Abstinence ', ' group intervention ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' brief advice ', ' Secure ', ' arm ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' same sex partner ', ' same sex relationship ', ' same-sex couple ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' retention strategy ', ' student retention ', ' retention rate ', ' Research Assistant ', ' 2-arm trial ', ' two-arm trial ', ' minority communities ', ' recruit ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' cigarette smoke ', ' smoking abstinence ', ' feasibility trial ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,K22,2020,157680,0.27999622846085653
"Differences in Inflammation, Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Respiratory Health with Use of Menthol Cigarettes: Informing the Regulation of Tobacco Flavorings to Protect Public Health Project Title: “Differences in Inflammation, Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Respiratory Health with Use of Menthol Cigarettes: Informing the Regulation of Tobacco Flavorings to Protect Public Health” Abstract/Project Summary Despite smoking fewer cigarettes per day, Black men and women are at greater risk for some tobacco-related diseases including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, compared to their white counterparts. The substantially higher prevalence of menthol cigarette use among Black smokers may contribute to these disparities. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act gave the Food and Drug Administration Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) the authority to restrict the manufacture, sale and distribution of menthol cigarettes as appropriate to protect public health. An important part of the determination for the regulation of menthol cigarettes concerns the health effects of mentholated relative to nonmentholated cigarettes. Studies examining differences in health effects with menthol cigarette use have mainly focused on all-cause mortality and cancer outcomes, with few studies considering cardiovascular or pulmonary outcomes. There is limited information regarding potential differences in cardiovascular risk factors or respiratory health with menthol cigarette use and no studies have examined differences in inflammation comparing menthol and nonmenthol cigarette smokers. Therefore, the main objective of this project is to evaluate differences in systemic inflammation, cardiovascular risk factors and respiratory health with use of menthol cigarettes among smokers in the US. To meet this objective, we will leverage existing, publicly accessible interview, physical examination and biological specimen data from 9,880 adult current smokers who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a series of nationally-representative surveys of the US population, from 1999 through 2016. Multivariable adjusted linear and logistic regression models will be used to evaluate the associations between menthol compared to nonmenthol cigarette use with: (1) markers of systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, white blood cell count, and homocysteine); (2) cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, and reduced kidney function); and (3) respiratory health outcomes (fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels, spirometry-defined pulmonary impairment, past year wheeze, and frequent cough and frequent phlegm). This proposed research will provide needed information to guide the CTP determination regarding the banning of menthol cigarettes. Findings from this study will provide insight into differences in risk of tobacco-related diseases that could have implications for the regulation of menthol cigarettes in the US, including the potential health impacts to Black communities who are burdened by greater menthol cigarette advertising and promotion. Narrative/Relevance The CTP has the authority to restrict the manufacture, sale and distribution of menthol cigarettes as appropriate to protect public health. The proposed project will evaluate differences in inflammation, cardiovascular risk factors and respiratory health with use of menthol cigarettes among US smokers.","Differences in Inflammation, Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Respiratory Health with Use of Menthol Cigarettes: Informing the Regulation of Tobacco Flavorings to Protect Public Health",9933108,R03HL147318,"['absorption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Advertising ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Communities ', ' Coughing ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Factor One ', ' Health ', ' Homocysteine ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interview ', ' Irritants ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Laboratories ', ' White Blood Cell Count procedure ', ' Leukocyte Count ', ' Leukocyte Number ', ' White Blood Cell Count ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Marketing ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Menthol ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nitric Oxide ', ' Endogenous Nitrate Vasodilator ', ' Endothelium-Derived Nitric Oxide ', ' Mononitrogen Monoxide ', ' Nitrogen Monoxide ', ' Nitrogen Protoxide ', ' endothelial cell derived relaxing factor ', ' Physical Examination ', ' Medical Inspection ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sales ', ' Smoking ', ' Spirometry ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' USFDA ', ' Wheezing ', ' wheeze ', ' Woman ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' insight ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Cigarette Smoker ', ' Heavy Metals ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Exhaling ', ' Respiratory Expiration ', ' Exhalation ', ' Flavorant ', ' Flavoring Agents ', ' Flavoring ', ' respiratory ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' authority ', ' Cigarette ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cigarette ads ', ' cigarette advertising ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 20 years of age ', ' age 20 years ', ' twenty year old ', ' twenty years of age ', ' 20 year old ', ' Impairment ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' FSPTCA ', ' Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act ', ' respiratory health ', ' study population ', ' differences in health ', ' health difference ', ' Inhaling ', ' Inhalation ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' tobacco toxicant ', ' tobacco products ', ' ']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,81875,0.10051634598717936
"e-Decidete: Mobile Cessation Support for Latino Smokers Project Summary - eDecídete: Mobile Cessation Support for Latino Smokers  Latinos are less likely than non-Hispanic whites to have access to health, to have knowledge of existing smoking cessation resources, to receive advice to stop smoking, and to participate in smoking cessation programs. Mobile technologies can dramatically enhance the reach of effective smoking cessation interventions. However, the reach of mobile interventions among Latinos remains minimal despite the fact that Latinos utilize smartphones at a higher rate. The primary aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of eDecídete (Spanish for “you can choose”), an innovative 12 week mobile smoking cessation intervention based on this work that incorporates two elements: 1) a tablet-based e-health educational session that collects personal smoking-related information to develop an individualized quit plan and guide automated and interactive text messaging; and 2) a text messaging program that includes educational information, behavioral strategies, motivational and supportive messaging, and prompts to use pharmacotherapy to support smoking cessation. Aim 1. To evaluate the impact of the culturally accommodated eDecídete program versus standard care on smoking abstinence at Month 6 among Latino smokers. At Month 6, smokers in eDecídete will have significantly higher cotinine-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence (no cigarettes in the past 7 days) than smokers in the control arm. Aim 2. To assess therapeutic alliance, pharmacotherapy utilization, and self-efficacy as mediators of the presumed treatment effect on cotinine-verified 7-day smoking abstinence at Month 6 among Latino smokers. Our hypothesis is that eDecídete will have greater efficacy for smoking cessation than standard care by increasing therapeutic alliance, utilization of pharmacotherapy, and self-efficacy to quit. Aim 3. To conduct a process evaluation that can inform findings and future improvements. The evaluation will assess 1) satisfaction with the program and its components; 2) text-message system utilization patterns and common content themes in text message interactions among eDecídete participants. Project Narrative Latinos are the largest and fastest growing population in the U.S., and tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease and death among U.S. Latinos. Although enhancing tobacco use treatment for this at-risk, underserved group is a critical public health priority, little is known about effectively treating Latino smokers. This innovative study will directly evaluate a culturally-enhanced technology-driven, smoking cessation intervention for Latino smokers, with the long-term goal of reducing tobacco-related health disparities, disease and death among Latinos.",e-Decidete: Mobile Cessation Support for Latino Smokers,9880282,R01CA212189,"['Adoption ', ' Communities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Cotinine ', ' Scotine ', ' Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Elements ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Smoking ', ' Tablets ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Services ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Cigarette ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Enhancement Technology ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' community based service ', ' Abstinence ', ' treatment effect ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' community setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' successful intervention ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' public health priorities ', ' followup assessment ', ' follow up assessment ', ' arm ', ' e-Health ', ' eHealth ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile computing ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' recruit ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' service providers ', ' smoking abstinence ', ' community clinic ', ' ']",NCI,HACKENSACK UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,111356,0.19552421322662938
"Determinants and Outcomes of Nicotine Metabolite Ratio in HIV + Smokers PROJECT SUMMARY Smoking rates in people living with HIV (PLWH) exceed 40%, nearly 3x uninfected individuals. Cardiovascular disease (CVD), including myocardial infarction (MI), is common in PLWH, in part due to smoking. Despite availability of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy, cessation rates among PLWH remain low. Frameworks for understanding smoking cessation emphasize biological, psychological, and social factors. However, critical gaps in identifying and addressing biological factors related to tobacco use among PLWH remain. In the general population, the rate at which nicotine is metabolized is an important biomarker of smoking behavior and treatment response. Greater CYP2A6 enzyme activity, as measured by higher nicotine metabolite ratios (NMR), results in: faster nicotine clearance, more cigarettes smoked per day, higher nicotine dependence, greater severity of withdrawal symptoms and reduced cessation. Recent work from our lab found significantly higher NMRs in HIV suggesting effects in HIV may differ. Differences in NMR may be affected by HIV infection and/or antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV itself may increase NMR as CYP2A6 is induced by inflammation, which may mirror dysregulation caused by HIV infection. ART drugs may alter NMR via other mechanisms: they may reduce NMR by reducing inflammation via viral suppression, reduce NMR via CYP2A6 inhibition, or increase NMR via CYP2A6 induction. And these mechanisms may differ by ART drug. Moreover, the impact of higher NMR on smoking and complications of smoking (e.g., MI) among PLWH are currently unknown. Higher NMR influences smoking topography (e.g., higher puff volume), which is associated with greater exposure to inducers of inflammation and coagulation. While higher NMR increases lung cancer risk, its effect on MI is unknown. We propose to: 1) determine whether NMR is faster after HIV infection, relative to before, 2) determine whether viral suppression decreases NMR and whether the effect differs by ART drugs which do and do not alter CYP2A6 activity, 3) determine whether lower NMR predicts higher smoking cessation rates in PLWH on ART with viral suppression, and 4) determine whether NMR is a risk factor for MI in PLWH. We will conduct retrospective cohort studies with paired specimens for Aims 1 and 2 and nested case-control studies for Aims 3 and 4. Data and specimens will be obtained from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) /Women's Intra-agency Health Study (WIHS) and the CFAR Network Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) databases and specimen repositories. Elucidating the relationship between HIV, ART, and smoking, may lead to the development of targeted interventions for smokers with HIV infection such as adding drugs that decrease CYP2A6 activity or switching off ART drugs that induce CYP2A6. If NMR is a predictor of MI, it will help us identify a subpopulation of PLWH in more urgent need of interventions. Smokers with HIV lose more life years to tobacco use than to HIV, partly due to increases in smoking-related comorbidities including CVD. Thus, interventions targeting HIV+ smokers may substantially reduce mortality globally. PROJECT NARRATIVE We hypothesize that HIV and its treatment influence nicotine metabolism, causing HIV+ individuals to have the observed high rates of smoking and making it harder for them to quit and that those with higher nicotine metabolism have high rates of myocardial infarction. If these hypotheses are borne out, nicotine metabolism will become a new biomarker of risk to target for interventions to decrease smoking in HIV.",Determinants and Outcomes of Nicotine Metabolite Ratio in HIV + Smokers,9927113,R01HL151292,"['Affect ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cotinine ', ' Scotine ', ' Database Management Systems ', ' Data Base Management ', ' Data Base Management Systems ', ' database management ', ' database systems ', ' relational database management systems ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' isoniazid ', ' Isonicotinic Acid Hydrazide ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Lipopolysaccharides ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Nested Case-Control Study ', ' Nicotine ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sleep ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' hydroxycotinine ', "" 3'-hydroxycotinine "", ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Withdrawal Symptom ', ' Hepatic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological Substance Banks ', ' biological specimen repository ', ' biosample repository ', ' biospecimen repository ', ' specimen bank ', ' specimen repository ', ' Biological Specimen Banks ', ' Individual ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' enzyme activity ', ' Exposure to ', ' Smoker ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Life ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Country ', ' Viral ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' interest ', ' cancer risk ', ' efavirenz ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' CYP2B6 ', ' Cytochrome P450, Phenobarbital-Inducible ', ' Cytochrome P450, Subfamily IIB, Polypeptide 6 ', ' CYP2B6 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral response ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' HIV anti-retroviral ', ' HIV antiretroviral ', ' Retrospective cohort study ', ' The Multi-center AIDS Cohort Study ', ' The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study ', ' cigarette smoke ', ' social factors ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,541423,0.20757104311417388
"Smoke-free Air Coalitions in Georgia and Armenia: A Community Randomized Trial SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Public health efforts in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) could be catalyzed by bolstering ways to optimally leverage local talents and resources, such as civil society. Developing effective models for aligning civil society and governmental public health at the local level in LMICs has the potential to impact a range of chronic diseases and risk factors, including tobacco. Local coalitions have been a dominant strategy in tobacco control in the US, with well-documented success in establishing smoke-free policies specifically. However, this approach has not been widely leveraged or well-studied in LMICs or those with less democratic traditions than the US. Instead, in many LMICs, smoke-free policy progress is largely initiated at the national level. Parallel civil society movements at the local level may be needed to build support for and compliance with policies. Given their sociopolitical histories and high tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) rates, Georgia (GE) and Armenia (AM) are two strategic settings for the proposed work. The smoking prevalence is 57.7% and 52.3% in men (6th and 11th highest in the world) and 5.7% and 1.5% in women, respectively. Moreover, our findings indicate extremely high rates of SHSe. However, we also documented high receptivity to public smoke-free policies despite high use rates, particularly in worksites and restaurants. This proposal is a well-justified extension of the literature and our prior work. We will build the capacity of GE and AM researchers to conduct high-quality mixed methods tobacco research and test the Community Coalition Action Theory as a framework for impacting local community-driven policy change. Researchers from the GE National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) and AM National Institute of Health (NIH) will collaborate with Emory to execute the proposed research, train tobacco control researchers within their organizations and partnering universities, and train practitioners within local communities to build local coalitions for tobacco control policy. We aim to: 1) conduct a matched-pair community randomized controlled trial in 28 municipalities in GE and AM to examine the impact of local coalitions promoting the adoption of smoke-free policies in worksites and restaurants, with the primary outcome of changes in SHSe over time; 2) assess how community context and coalition factors influence adoption of organizational and municipal smoke-free policies to provide an evidence- base for public health practice; 3) disseminate research findings regarding both the effectiveness and the process of establishing and maintaining coalitions, and consequently increasing smoke-free policies and reducing SHSe, to key stakeholders in GE and AM; and 4) capitalize on the proposed research and dissemination opportunities to build tobacco control research capacity within the GE NCDC, AM NIH, and partnering universities, as well as practice capacity within local public health centers and their civil society partners. Ultimately, the activities outlined in this proposal will serve as a catalyst for future action-oriented science and evidence-based practice to support tobacco control progress in this region more broadly. PROJECT NARRATIVE Developing effective models for aligning civil society and governmental public health at the local level in LMICs has the potential to impact a range of chronic diseases and risk factors, including tobacco. In this proposal, we will partner with the national public health agencies in Georgia and Armenia – two countries with extremely high rates of smoking and secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) and with sociopolitical histories not conducive to local activism; we will examine: 1) the impact of local coalitions promoting smoke-free policies in worksites and restaurants on SHSe in these challenging environments and 2) how community context and coalition factors influence adoption of organizational and municipal smoke-free policies. We will capitalize on the proposed research to build tobacco control research capacity in our partnering institutions, as well as practice capacity within local communities; results will be disseminated in order to serve as a catalyst for future action- oriented science and evidence-based practice to support tobacco control progress in this region.",Smoke-free Air Coalitions in Georgia and Armenia: A Community Randomized Trial,9899341,R01TW010664,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Air ', ' Armenia ', ' Attention ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Future ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Health Resources ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Influentials ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Talents ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Site ', ' Work Location ', ' Work Place ', ' Work-Site ', ' Worksite ', ' work setting ', ' Workplace ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Policies ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Municipalities ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' tobacco policy ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' research dissemination ', ' research data dissemination ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Advocate ', ' Research Training ', ' Tobacco Control Research ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' tobacco control ', ' Population ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' civil society ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' clean indoor air law ', ' smoke-free air law ', ' smoke-free air policy ', ' smokefree air law ', ' smokefree policy ', ' smoke-free policy ', ' Passive Smoke Exposure ', ' exposure to ETS ', ' exposure to SHS ', ' exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to tobacco smoke ', ' second hand smoke exposure ', ' secondhand smoke exposure ', ' environmental tobacco smoke exposure ', ' model building ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' disparities in sex ', ' sex disparity ', ' Infrastructure ', ' health goals ', ' ']",FIC,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,296631,0.10357744783394394
"Financial incentives for homeless smokers: A community-based RCT PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Homeless people have a 3.5-fold higher prevalence of cigarette smoking in comparison to non-homeless people, contributing to 2-fold higher rates of lung cancer and 3- to 5-fold higher rates of tobacco-attributable death. Homeless smokers want to quit, but studies have not yet uncovered the optimal approach to help them do so. In a recently published 8-week pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program (BHCHP), we found that financial incentives for smoking abstinence were associated with 7-fold higher odds of brief smoking abstinence in comparison to a non-incentivized control condition. These results suggest that financial incentives are a promising approach for reducing smoking in this vulnerable population, although further investigation in a larger sample is needed to improve the duration of on-treatment abstinence, assess post-treatment effects, and better understand mechanisms of action and contextual factors that may influence treatment response. To address these gaps, we will conduct a community-based RCT of financial incentives for smoking abstinence among adult smokers at BHCHP. We will recruit 400 participants from 3 BHCHP sites and randomize them to receive guideline-concordant standard care with (N=200) or without (N=200) financial incentives for smoking abstinence. Standard care will consist of 8 weeks of combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and 5 sessions with a tobacco coach who will provide behavioral counseling, distribute NRT, and coordinate referrals to existing tobacco treatment resources. Incentive arm participants will additionally receive a 24-week schedule of 20 debit card payments contingent on short-term abstinence based on exhaled carbon monoxide levels, augmented with 16 interspersed payments contingent on longer-term abstinence based on urine anabasine levels. We will use an embedded-experiment mixed methods design, where qualitative (‘qual’) data collection is embedded within a larger quantitative (‘QUAN’) RCT with the following aims: Aim 1. (QUAN) To determine the effect of the financial incentives intervention on anabasine-verified 7-day smoking abstinence at A) the end of treatment (24 weeks) and B) 24 weeks after treatment (48 weeks). We hypothesize that incentive arm participants will have greater abstinence at both timepoints. Aim 2. (qual) To assess why, how, and under what circumstances homeless smokers A) achieve abstinence in response to financial incentives and B) maintain abstinence after incentives are stopped. To accomplish this aim, we will interview selected participants at 24 and 48 weeks, probing cognitive, procedural, and contextual dimensions of their response to financial incentives to generate hypotheses about mechanisms for on-treatment and post-treatment effects and to inform future work in this area. Our findings could have important tobacco treatment implications for the 934,000 people served annually in US Health Care for the Homeless programs, advancing NCI’s objective of reducing smoking in vulnerable populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Homeless people have a 3.5-fold higher prevalence of cigarette smoking in comparison to non-homeless people, contributing to 2-fold higher rates of lung cancer and 3- to 5-fold higher rates of tobacco-attributable death. To advance the public health objective of improving smoking cessation in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, we will conduct a community-based randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of financial incentives on smoking abstinence among adult smokers at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program.

"Tobacco Use Trajectories And Disparities Among Sexual Minorities In U.S Adolescents And Adults Project Summary/Abstract Tobacco use is responsible for enormous health and financial costs in the U.S. including more than 480,000 deaths per year due to cigarette use and more than $193 billion annually in health care costs and loss of productivity. Sexual minority individuals are at substantially greater risk for tobacco use and tobacco use disorder (TUD) and tobacco-related health outcomes compared to heterosexual individuals in the U.S. Longitudinal data is needed to understand differences in tobacco use across time and resultant tobacco- related health disparities among sexual minorities. This information is necessary to inform tobacco regulatory policy strategies to reduce these health disparities. We draw on concepts of minority stress and intersectionality to understand these tobacco use trajectories and related health disparities by sexual orientation. This proposal is in direct response to RFA-OD-19-022 by using secondary data to examine tobacco use trajectories and its health effects over time in a vulnerable population, focusing on new tobacco products. The national and longitudinal Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify differences in tobacco use trajectories, associated health disparities, and mechanisms behind these differences. Using PATH data we will be able to examine detailed tobacco use trajectories across four waves, sexual identity transitions across four waves, and prospective links to health outcomes. In addition we triangulate both self-report and biological data on stress and health. Using PATH’s large nationally representative dataset of youth and adults, this study aims to: (1) To examine tobacco product initiation and use trajectories by sexual orientation and their associations with regular tobacco use and TUD symptoms; (2) To identify tobacco use trajectories by sexual orientation and differential associations with self report and biological health outcomes among adults; (3) To examine the role of biological and psychological stress on tobacco use trajectories, tobacco cessation and tobacco-related health outcomes among adults and how this differs by sexual orientation and transitions in sexual identity. We will assess tobacco trajectories, with emphasis on specific changes of critical public health importance including: (1) tobacco use initiation, (2) progression in the number of tobacco products used (i.e., single product use to dual/polytobacco use) with a focus on trajectories including e-cigarettes and those without and (3) increases and decreases in tobacco frequency. Aims 2 and 3 will innovatively make use of the wealth of both survey self-report measures of stress (psychological distress) and health outcomes (respiratory illness, cancer, cardiovascular disease) alongside biological markers of stress (e.g., C-reactive protein, interleukin-6) and tobacco-specific markers linked to cancer risk (NNAL, NNN, TNE2). We will examine important moderators including age, sex, race, and ethnicity throughout all aims. This project will greatly inform and maximize effectiveness of tobacco regulatory policies particularly those aimed at reducing the health burden of tobacco use among sexual minorities. Project Narrative This study will expand current knowledge of tobacco-related health disparities among sexual minorities, along with the mechanisms behind these disparities and the associated biological and self-reported health outcomes. By examining new research questions related to the relationships between race, stress, tobacco use, and health, the proposed longitudinal study will inform public health and tobacco regulatory policies, guide clinical practice, and enhance future longitudinal research.",Tobacco Use Trajectories And Disparities Among Sexual Minorities In U.S Adolescents And Adults,10026894,R21DA051388,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Advertising ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Financial cost ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BSF2 ', ' HPGF ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IL-6 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Tobacco Use Disorder ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Policies ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Exposure to ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' respiratory ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' interest ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' fluidity ', ' stressor ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' age difference ', ' psychological distress ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' tobacco-induced cancer ', ' tobacco-related cancer ', ' Tobacco-Related Carcinoma ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' sex ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' productivity loss ', ' time use ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' 14 years of age ', ' age 14 years ', ' fourteen year old ', ' fourteen years of age ', ' 14 year old ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' sexual minority ', ' e-cig ', ' e-cigarette ', ' ecig ', ' ecigarette ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' health data ', ' poly-tobacco use ', ' polytobacco use ', ' intersectionalities ', ' intersectionality ', ' secondary analysis ', ' Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health ', ' tobacco regulatory science ', ' sexual identity ', ' tobacco products ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Emerging Tobacco Products ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2020,234000,0.0898592809704237
"Perinatal Attentional Retraining Intervention for Smoking (PARIS) for Minority Women ABSTRACT Racial and ethnic minorities and women experience a disproportionate burden of smoking-related diseases, including cancer and heart disease. Maternal smoking is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the mother, and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and increased infant morbidity and mortality. This further compounds the disparities in adverse birth outcomes experienced by racial and ethnic minorities. Nearly half of women who smoke prior to pregnancy achieve abstinence during pregnancy. Unfortunately, nearly 80% of abstinent women relapse within a year after delivery. Despite considerable study, there are few strategies that effectively combat smoking relapse in this population. This is especially true for minority women who are less likely to receive treatment and more likely to relapse to smoking postpartum than non-Hispanic whites. Smokers exhibit an “attention bias” for smoking-related cues. Attentional bias plays a role in the maintenance or escalation of smoking by increasing subjective cravings and directly affecting cigarette seeking behavior. Attentional retraining (AR) using the visual probe task has been used experimentally to reduce attentional bias and blunt cue-provoked craving. Stress and negative affect are considered major drivers of relapse, especially in women. AR is effective at attenuating anxiety related to transition stress, such as that experienced by women postpartum. The overarching goal of this pilot project is to test a novel technique, the use of smartphones to administer AR, as an intervention for smoking relapse prevention in postpartum women. AR will target both smoking cues and stress cues. We will assess whether AR reduces attentional bias, blunts cue-provoking smoking cravings after delivery, attenuates stress, and reduces smoking lapses. We propose to randomize 50 abstinent pregnant African American and/or Hispanic smokers to receive either the AR or control visual probe task. Participants will be asked to carry around a smartphone as they go about their daily lives for 2 weeks in their last month of pregnancy. The smartphone will sound an alert randomly during the day, at which time participants will be asked to respond to a short set of questions assessing subjective states; this will be followed by a request to complete the AR (or control) procedures. This same procedure will be repeated for 2 weeks in the first postpartum month. Outcome measures include attentional bias for smoking and stress stimuli, self-reported craving and perceived stress, and percentage of days and number of cigarettes smoked during the trial. This application is designed to confirm the feasibility and process parameters of the study, and obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of the intervention and the components that comprise the intervention. If AR shows promise as a treatment, it will be tested in a larger randomized controlled trial. The proposed project is a novel intervention for postpartum minority women that builds on the naturally occurring period of abstinence, and has the potential to consolidate and extend abstinence beyond pregnancy. NARRATIVE Smoking is the leading cause of preventable cancer mortality in women, with African American and Hispanic women having an even greater burden tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. Maternal smoking is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes and increased infant morbidity and mortality, and women have high rates of relapse to smoking following childbirth, yet there are no effective treatments for tobacco addiction in racial and ethnic minority women postpartum. The proposed application will examine the utility of attention retraining, administered on a mobile device, as an intervention to prevent smoking relapse in African American and Hispanic women postpartum.",Perinatal Attentional Retraining Intervention for Smoking (PARIS) for Minority Women,10020194,R21MD012697,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cues ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Maintenance ', ' Memory ', ' Morbidity -

"Impact of Cigar Flavor on Tobacco Use Behaviors and Addiction in Dual Users PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The rapid increase in popularity of dual use of flavored little cigars/cigarillos (LCCs) with cigarettes among U.S. young adults has significant implications for their health, addiction, and cessation. LCCs are used for two primary reasons: their relatively lower cost and flavor offerings. As cigarettes become more expensive or less reinforcing, young adults may substitute with attractively flavored LCCs rather than quit. We do not know the addictiveness of LCCs compared with cigarettes in dual users, the role that flavors play in addiction and dual use, and if flavors are more important for women than men. Moreover, the FDA has described research on cigars and flavors as a priority. Therefore, a critical need exists to characterize the addiction potential (AP) of flavored and unflavored LCCs compared with cigarettes and differences by sex in dual users.  The specific aims are to: (1) characterize the AP of LCCs compared with cigarettes; (2) determine the extent to which the AP of LCCs varies by flavor and sex of user; and (3) determine the extent to which LCC use in the home environment differs by flavored vs. unflavored. The proposed study will employ a 3-week crossover design that combines survey-based measures (including behavioral economic assessments), biomarkers, and ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) of AP, dependence, and tobacco use behaviors among 145 non-treatment-seeking young adult (18-34 years old) dual users. AP will be characterized by behavioral economic indices of demand, such as the hypothetical consumption of LCCs at escalating prices, and other standardized measures of addiction. The impact of flavors on LCC and cigarette smoking at home will be captured by EMA. This information will address the following FDA priorities: impact of changes in LCC flavors on dependence and dual use behaviors, and innovative methods to assess tobacco use behaviors.  The career development plan combines mentored hands-on training with coursework and professional development activities to meet the objectives critical to my transition to independent tobacco regulatory scientist. My career goal is to conduct research that develops our understanding of tobacco use in vulnerable populations, and informs tobacco regulation to reduce disease. I propose additional training in addictions research (including clinical trials), measurement of dependence and addiction potential, cigar regulatory research, and grantsmanship. With this training and my prior experience, I will be able to transition to an independent investigator of tobacco product flavorings and other characteristics that—with cognitive, affective, behavioral, and environmental influences—contribute to their uptake, use, and addiction. UConn Health, Brown, and Rutgers provide excellent resources for my career development, including formal coursework, seminars, expert faculty, research centers, office space, equipment, software, and data collection, analysis, and management resources. The focused training provided by this Award represents the final step in my career development and provides preliminary data and training for planned R-level grant writing. PROJECT NARRATIVE The dual use of little cigars/cigarillos (LCCs) and cigarettes is a significant public health concern for young adults' health and tobacco addiction. Among young adult dual users, this study compares the addiction potential of LCCs to cigarettes and determines if flavors enhance the addiction and if women are especially susceptible.

"Mindfulness-Based Addiction Treatment Delivered Through Mobile Technology for Low-Income Smokers Project Summary/Abstract  Adults with low socioeconomic status (SES) experience greater nicotine dependence, are less likely to quit smoking, and experience profound tobacco-related health disparities. There is an urgent need to improve upon evidence-based nicotine dependence treatments that are tailored for low-SES smokers. Mindfulness training increases rates of smoking abstinence and lapse recovery, but in-person mindfulness treatment is not easily accessible to low-SES smokers. Mobile health technology (mHealth) is an accessible, cost-effective modality for offering vital 24/7 smoking cessation support. We developed a text messaging program (iQuit Mindfully 1.0) that provides personalized, interactive mHealth messages to encourage low-SES smokers to use mindfulness and other smoking cessation techniques in the moments when they need them most. This program was designed based on iterative feedback from low-SES smokers, and serves as an adjunct to in-person mindfulness training. Our pilot work demonstrates that iQuit Mindfully 1.0 is feasible, acceptable, and perhaps most effective for low-SES smokers (i.e., 23.1% of participants living in poverty who received iQuit Mindfully achieved abstinence at end of treatment and 1-month follow-up, while none of those living in poverty quit in the in-person-only treatment). However, accessibility would be immensely improved by fully delivering the program through mHealth. This proposal aims to develop, refine and evaluate feasibility of iQuit Mindfully 2.0 (i.e., iQuit Mindfully that is fully delivered through an mHealth app to increase accessibility for low-SES smokers). Aims are: 1) Develop iQuit Mindfully 2.0 using an existing mHealth app platform to deliver mindfulness-based smoking cessation treatment that is specifically designed for low-SES smokers; 2) Refine iQuit Mindfully 2.0 based on usability testing with low-SES smokers; and 3) Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of iQuit Mindfully 2.0. The app will be refined after 2 weeks of preliminary testing with 20 low-SES smokers. Then, 60 low-SES smokers will be randomly assigned to iQuit Mindfully 2.0 (n=30) or the NCI QuitGuide app (n=30) in a feasibility trial. Participants will complete questionnaire measures and biochemical confirmation of smoking behavior at baseline, 8, and 12 weeks; weekly assessments of hypothesized psychosocial mechanisms; and individual in-depth interviews at 12 weeks. The expected products of this feasibility study are: 1) engagement with the app and follow-up rates; 2) participant ratings and suggestions for further improvement; and 3) documented trends over time by condition in smoking status and hypothesized psychosocial mechanisms. Pending feasibility, this study would provide the groundwork for rapid launch of a full-scale randomized clinical trial to examine efficacy. If efficacious, the iQuit Mindfully app could provide more cost-effective, accessible smoking cessation treatment (e.g., offered at no cost through federally qualified health centers, substance abuse/mental health treatment/community centers, etc.) to target health disparities among low-SES smokers. Project Narrative Adults with low socioeconomic status (SES) experience greater nicotine dependence, are less likely to quit smoking, and experience profound tobacco-related health disparities.

"Investigating the relationship between menthol flavor and nicotine metabolism in African Americans who smoke cigarettes Project Summary African Americans are more likely than Whites to die from smoking related diseases and are less successful at smoking cessation with the current FDA-approved aids. Thus, this proposal seeks to investigate the use of e- cigarettes on smoking reduction in African American and White smokers. This proposal will elucidate the relationship between nicotine metabolism and nicotine concentrations in e-cigarettes on smoking behavior and toxicant exposure in African American and White smokers. We hypothesize that slow nicotine metabolizers will have higher nicotine plasma levels than normal nicotine metabolizers at all nicotine concentrations and report greater positive subjective effects. Additionally, we hypothesize that slow nicotine metabolizers will be more likely to reduce their smoking with e-cigarettes because studies show slower nicotine metabolizing smokers are more successful on nicotine replacement therapies than normal or fast nicotine metabolizing smokers. The outcomes of the project will provide new information to further develop the knowledge base in understanding which nicotine concentration manufacturers should include in e-liquids to reduce smoking behaviors. Regulatory efforts could cap the nicotine content in e-liquids to reduce the addictive potential of e-cigs to adolescents but provide a harm reduction avenue for smokers, especially African American smokers, to protect overall public health. Project Narrative Combustible tobacco product use is associated with half a million annual deaths in the United States and African Americans are disproportionately burdened by tobacco-related diseases. This proposal will elucidate the relationship between nicotine metabolism and nicotine concentrations in e-cigarettes on smoking behavior and toxicant exposure in African American and White smokers.

"Biomarker of Lung Disease in African Americans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the 3rd leading cause of death in the US1,2. Although COPD occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develops chronic airflow limitation or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). Identification molecular profiles from current or former smokers who are likely to progress is a crucial step in understanding the pathogenesis of COPD and emphysema. There are very few publications that describe COPD biomarkers in large, well phenotyped cohorts that include a significant number of African Americans. This study will leverage large NIH- supported cohorts (COPDGene, SPIROMICS, and MESA-Lung) that have large number of well-characterized African Americans subjects with or at risk for COPD. Since the subjects have stored plasma and have been followed for 7-10 years with extensive clinical, physiologic, and imaging, we can very cost-effectively apply a proteomic approach. Furthermore, because the cohorts have other valuable Omics data, we can integrate the proteomic findings with whole genome sequencing and other advanced molecular studies such as genomics. This knowledge may help develop novel diagnostic tests and therapies for early prevention and treatment of COPD and will identify any markers that are specific to smoking-related lung disease in African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third most common cause of death in the United States. The major risk factor is smoking; however, most smokers do not develop COPD and the factors that identify who goes from normal to abnormal lung function are unknown. Most of the studies on COPD have been in non-Hispanic Whites and Asians and there are very few studies, which address risk factors and molecular pathogenesis in African Americans. This proposal will use three existing NHLBI cohorts to identify blood signatures that can identify who will be at risk for developing smoking related lung disease in African Americans.

"Optimizing remotely delivered Smoking Cessation Services for Low-Income Smokers ABSTRACT Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of cancer and many other deadly diseases, and the burden of tobacco use is greatest among those with limited socioeconomic resources. Although we have driven down population smoking rates, and with them, cancer rates, roughly 28% of the socioeconomically disadvantaged still smoke regularly. Low-income (L-I) smokers also develop cancer at higher rates and struggle more to quit than do higher-income smokers. These disparities in tobacco use and its burdens must be addressed. Highly effective cessation treatment services that can be delivered remotely, flexibly, and conveniently with few cost or logistical barriers have the potential to achieve this aim. Tobacco quitline and SmokefreeTXT services are such treatment resources with demonstrated attractiveness and reach among L-I smokers. The current proposal will use an efficient factorial design to evaluate 4 smoking cessation interventions with vast reach and dissemination potential. The target population will be N=1,408 Medicaid-eligible or uninsured smokers who have recently enrolled in the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line (WTQL), but who report continued smoking 4- months following engagement in standard WTQL services. These treatment non-responders will be invited to participate in an experiment that will randomize them to 1 of 2 levels of each of the following 4 factors in a 2X2X2X2 design: WTQL counseling intensity (1 session vs. 4 sessions), medication intensity (2-week nicotine patch monotherapy vs. 4-week nicotine patch and lozenge combination therapy), a supportive text messaging program (SmokefreeTXT vs. none), and financial incentives (rewards of up to $150 for treatment engagement vs. no treatment incentives). The primary outcome will be 26-week biochemically confirmed point-prevalence abstinence. Analyses will examine the main and interactive effects of these 4 treatment components on 26- week and secondary abstinence outcomes to identify the components and combinations of components that significantly enhance success in quitting in this high-risk population. This experiment will identify especially effective combinations of highly scalable interventions of modest cost and few barriers that could be disseminated nationally to reduce socioeconomic disparities in smoking cessation among those seeking to quit. Additional analyses will: compare intervention components and promising component combinations in terms of cost-effectiveness, examine whether or not treatment engagement differs across component combinations, examine baseline variables that may moderate treatment response, and identify mediators of treatment effects on abstinence outcomes. Because delivery of the study interventions can be centralized through established and efficient services (WTQL and SmokefreeTXT), the potential for both scalable dissemination and cost-effectiveness of the interventions tested is great. The proposed research will help identify ways to reduce tobacco cessation disparities in L-I smokers who have tried to quit smoking but relapsed and may benefit from improved assistance. NARRATIVE This experiment will identify scalable interventions that can be delivered to low-income smokers, a high-risk group with high smoking and low smoking-cessation rates, by phone or through the mail to help them quit smoking after a recent failed attempt to quit smoking. This research will suggest ways to most efficiently combine convenient interventions to improve success in quitting among low-income smokers who bear a disproportionate burden of tobacco use, relative to higher-income smokers.",Optimizing remotely delivered Smoking Cessation Services for Low-Income Smokers,9994854,R01CA218156,"['Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Combined Modality Therapy ', ' Multimodal Therapy ', ' Multimodal Treatment ', ' combination therapy ', ' combined modality treatment ', ' combined treatment ', ' multi-modal therapy ', ' multi-modal treatment ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Engineering ', ' Incentives ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' PF4 Gene ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' SCYB4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Target Populations ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' falls ', ' Uninsured ', ' quality assurance ', ' improved ', ' Biochemical ', ' Individual ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Logistics ', ' Policies ', ' Smoker ', ' Nicotine Skin Patch ', ' nicotine patch ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Smoking History ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Abstinence ', ' treatment effect ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' smoking intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' intervention effect ', ' smoking relapse ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial incentive ', ' followup assessment ', ' follow up assessment ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Preventable cancer cause ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' evaluate cost-effectiveness ', ' cost-effectiveness evaluation ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' recruit ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' treatment services ', ' tobacco-free ', ' preservation ', ' compare intervention ', ' comparison intervention ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,575646,0.3020784884563009
"Adoption, diffusion, and implementation of Tobacco 21 policies to address health disparities ABSTRACT Raising the minimum age of legal access (MLA) to tobacco products to 21 decreases access and would likely prevent or delay initiation of tobacco use by adolescents and young adults. However, modern tobacco behavior use among young people is increasingly complex and is characterized by decreased cigarette use, increased use of non-cigarette tobacco product use and, poly tobacco use. In addition, tobacco use patterns and tobacco sales to minors vary based on race/ethnicity. While there has been recent and rapid diffusion of Tobacco 21 policies, little data exist on the process, content, or outcomes of Tobacco 21 laws. The existing evidence for increasing the MLA to 21 holds promise to further reduce tobacco use among young people but the extent to which such policies will be effective for all tobacco products as well as all racial/ethnic groups is largely unknown. Using the Multiple Streams Framework and the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework as our conceptual frames we operationalize and assess health policy factors that impact Tobacco 21 Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance. This project uses a mixed methods approach to understand the implementation and impact of policies that raise the MLA to 21, seeking to expand the evidence base with a focus on racial/ethnic groups in the context of a diverse tobacco environment. Specifically, we will: (1) carry out a comparative case study of 15 states using document analysis of Tobacco 21 bills, news media content analysis, and key informant interviews to identify factors that may contribute to the adoption or rejection of Tobacco 21 legislation; (2) conduct a repeated cross sectional tobacco product purchase study to examine implementation of a statewide Tobacco 21 law in New Jersey; and, (3) describe the impact of Tobacco 21 laws by modeling tobacco use behavior among 13 to 25 year olds in states with and without Tobacco 21 laws using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. The relevance of the proposed research to public health is its ability to improve existing and future Tobacco 21 policies and reduce tobacco use disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of this research project is to better understand the implementation and impact of policies to raise the legal age of tobacco sales to 21, with a focus on racial/ethnic groups in the context of a diverse tobacco environment.

"The Impact of Tobacco Control Policies on Health Equity in the United States Project Summary Abstract Since the mid-1900s, tobacco control policies have effectively decreased smoking prevalence in the United States. However, important disparities by socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity in smoking prevalence and tobacco-related health outcomes persist. People with relatively lower education and income are more likely to smoke than their more affluent counterparts. In addition, although non-Hispanic Blacks and non-Hispanic Whites have a similar prevalence of smoking, Blacks have lower quit rates and higher lung cancer incidence and mortality than Whites. Hispanics, on the other hand, smoke less than Blacks or Whites. This suggests that current tobacco control policies do not adequately reduce, let alone eliminate, smoking disparities in vulnerable subgroups. However, few policy evaluations address smoking disparities, and the effects of policies across different SES and racial/ethnic subgroups are mostly unknown. Moreover, tobacco control policies are generally designed with broad populations in mind, without a focus on reducing the prevalence of smoking among specific populations. As a consequence, some policies may actually be exacerbating smoking disparities, even if their net population effect is positive. The objective of this study is to determine the health equity impact of established and emerging tobacco control policies in the US. The proposed project will: (1) determine how tobacco control policies influence disparities in smoking initiation among youth; (2) determine how tobacco control policies influence disparities in smoking cessation among adults; and (3) predict which combination of policies are needed to reduce health disparities in tobacco- attributable mortality over time using a tobacco policy simulation model. Aims 1 and 2 will systematically analyze two large, nationally-representative surveys over time to determine the extent to which tobacco control policies in the US affect disparities for smoking initiation and cessation, focusing on the differential impact of policies by education, income, and race/ethnicity (i.e., Whites, Blacks, Hispanics), and their possible intersection with gender. Aim 3 will integrate the evidence developed in Aims 1 and 2 into a simulation model to predict how policies, individually and in combination, will affect smoking disparities and future downstream tobacco-attributable deaths. The proposed study will take the field beyond describing smoking disparities to producing concrete, actionable evidence informing which tobacco control policies may be most effective in simultaneously reducing both overall smoking and tobacco-related health disparities. Knowledge gained from this study will guide policy-makers’ decisions regarding implementation of specific tobacco control policies by highlighting the importance of considering their contribution to tobacco-related health disparities. Project Narrative The proposed study will examine how tobacco control policies in the US affect disparities by socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity in smoking initiation and cessation. Findings from this research will provide critical evidence to policy makers and public health professionals at the local, state, and national levels as they consider the implications of tobacco control policy choices on tobacco-related health disparities.",The Impact of Tobacco Control Policies on Health Equity in the United States,10047448,R37CA214787,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Canada ', ' Data Sources ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Investments ', ' Mass Media ', ' mass information media ', ' mortality ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Sales ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Taxation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Site ', ' Work Location ', ' Work Place ', ' Work-Site ', ' Worksite ', ' work setting ', ' Workplace ', ' population survey ', ' Label ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Special Population ', ' named group ', ' success ', ' Media Campaign ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' tobacco policy ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' movie ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Tobacco Control Research ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' attributable death ', ' attributable mortality ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' prospective ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' comparative ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' health equity ', ' clean indoor air law ', ' smoke-free air law ', ' smoke-free air policy ', ' smokefree air law ', ' smokefree policy ', ' smoke-free policy ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R37,2020,54753,0.27332454784652616
"Gain-framed Messages and NRT Sampling to Promote Smoking Cessation in Lung Cancer Screening Programs PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lung cancer is now the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in the U.S. In addition to primary prevention (tobacco control), secondary prevention through early detection with low-dose CT scans is recognized as a technique to identify earlier stage, more treatable lung cancers in high-risk patients. Evidence from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that lung cancer screening with low-dose CT scans for high risk individuals (>30 pack years of smoking, <15 yr quit-time, and 55-74 yrs of age) conferred a 20% reduction in mortality for those patients who received 3 annual low dose CT scans. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently issued a final recommendation for annual screening for lung cancer in these high risk individuals, and many insurers now cover the screening. The present study is thus timely and novel – we will investigate whether we can achieve higher rates of short- and long-term cessation in this high risk population. We will conduct a 2 x 2 (gain-framed intervention vs. unframed intervention, starter package of 2 weeks of nicotine patches and lozenges vs. no medication) study to evaluation methods to boost rates of smoking cessation for a high-risk group of smokers (N=616) with varying levels of motivation across 2 study sites (MUSC, Yale). Participants will be identified through the MUSC and Yale lung cancer screening programs at both sites. Randomization will be stratified by study site and level of motivation. The primary hypothesis is that rates of smoking cessation will be significantly higher at 6-months after lung screening for the smoking cessation strategy involving a gain-framed intervention + 2 weeks of nicotine patches and lozenges compared to a strategy of an unframed behavioral intervention + no medication. Our secondary hypothesis is that rates of smoking cessation will be higher for the gain-framed intervention group vs. the unframed intervention group and the starter package of 2 weeks of nicotine patches and lozenges group vs. the no medication group. On an exploratory basis we will also examine mediators and moderators of treatment. We hypothesize that changes in self-efficacy, smoking cessation outcome expectancy, familiarization with NRT, motivation, and autonomy will act as mechanisms for the smoking cessation effects (i.e., will act as mediators of treatment). We also hypothesize that lung screening findings (e.g., presence of a nodule, cancer, etc), nicotine dependence, and health disparities will modify treatment response (i.e., will act as baseline moderators of treatment). This project is designed to be translational (in that it can be transferable from our controlled efficacy study to other lung screening programs at other institutions) as all of our media will be digital files ready for sharing, the procedures for NRT sampling will be easily copied, and the print materials can be provided as fillable templates for personalization. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recently approved annual lung cancer screening as a benefit for individuals: (1) ages 55-77 years old; (2) asymptomatic (no signs of lung cancer illness); (3) tobacco smoking history of at least 30 pack-years; and (4) report current smoking or quit smoking within the past 15 years. While one might hypothesize that simply having a CT scan may promote cessation, evidence suggests that having a scan increases quit rates only slightly, if there is any increase at all.

"Helping the Poor Quit Smoking: Specialized Quitlines and Meeting Basic Needs Project Summary/Abstract The impact of COVID-19 on low-income and minority populations has been profound, spanning health, employment, income, food, rent, transportation and daily needs like diapers and toilet paper. In Missouri, where the parent study and proposed supplement take place, disparities abound. African Americans make up <12% of the state population but over 40% of COVID-19 deaths – the second largest gap in the U.S. among states reporting race data. As of April 20, 2020, we have enrolled 1,743 low-income daily smokers in the parent study, a randomized trial testing two cessation interventions. Over half report annual household income <$10,000, most (59%) are African American, and many (30%) did not complete high school. They are also sick: 50% report at least one chronic condition (28% asthma, 20% COPD, 15% Type II diabetes, 10% heart disease), and 56% rate their health as “fair” (39%) or “poor” (17%). From March 9 to April 16, 2020, we administered COVID-19 survey items to 88 participants. Awareness of COVID-19 was high, but protective behaviors were inconsistent, and occupational exposures were high: of those who worked – 74% African Americans – only 19% had been off work and 6% worked from home during COVID. In short, low-wage minority smokers, often in fair or poor health, were working outside the home, having more contact with others, but with little protective equipment. We propose a highly innovative study in this sub-group using intensive longitudinal data collection and cutting-edge time series analyses to understand complex, dynamic relationships among four factors identified as priorities in the RFA: (1) employment disruptions; (2) social and economic needs; (3) adherence to COVID-19 containment and mitigation recommendations; and (4) health indicators and behaviors. The study will produce estimates that can be used to model adherence to protective measures and disruption to daily needs, personal health, and health behaviors such as smoking in low-wage minority workers during pandemics. Many quit smoking programs don't address unmet basic needs nor the unique life contexts of very low-income smokers. This study tests the effects of a new approach that integrates health (tobacco quitline) and social service (basic needs navigators) interventions to help low-income smokers quit and eliminate smoking-related cancer disparities.  ",Helping the Poor Quit Smoking: Specialized Quitlines and Meeting Basic Needs,10189315,R01CA201429,"['Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Containment ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Employment ', ' Equipment ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Household ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Missouri ', ' Occupational Exposure ', ' workplace exposure ', ' Paper ', ' Parents ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Chronic ', ' Smoker ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' meetings ', ' high school ', ' Participant ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Annual Reports ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' quit line ', ' quitline ', ' Minority ', ' protective behavior ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' economic need ', ' navigator intervention ', ' health-span ', ' healthspan ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID ', ' CoV disease ', ' corona virus disease ', ' coronavirus disease ', ' ']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,157486,0.10482750002254204
"Mindfulness-based Smoking Cessation Enhanced with Mobile Technology for Low-Income Smokers Project Summary/Abstract Tobacco use, a primary behavioral risk factor for cancer, is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Adults with low socioeconomic status (SES) and members of certain racial/ethnic minority groups are less likely to quit and consequently experience profound tobacco-related cancer disparities. There is an urgent need to improve upon evidence-based smoking cessation interventions to better serve these populations. Mindfulness training substantially increases rates of smoking cessation and lapse recovery. There is a dearth of research on mindfulness in low-SES and racial/ethnic minority groups, but these interventions do show promise for smoking cessation in these populations. However, additional between-session support may be needed for these smokers, who experience significant day-to-day barriers to quitting and have lower access to smoking cessation resources. Mobile health technology (mHealth) could provide vital 24/7 support for low- SES smokers. For example, personalized, interactive mHealth messages might encourage participants to use mindfulness and other smoking cessation techniques in the moments when they need them most (e.g., in times of high stress or craving), thus enhancing treatment effectiveness. Based on iterative feedback from low- SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers, we developed a text messaging program (“iQuit Mindfully”) as an adjunct to in-person mindfulness-based smoking cessation treatment. Our pilot work demonstrates that iQuit Mindfully is feasible, acceptable, and perhaps most effective for low-SES smokers (i.e., 23.1% of participants living in poverty who received iQuit Mindfully achieved abstinence at end of treatment and 1-month follow-up, while none of those living in poverty quit in the in-person-only treatment). Building on this pilot work, we will incorporate participant feedback to further increase interactivity and personalization so that iQuit Mindfully can more flexibly adapt to participants’ changing needs. The specific aims of this project are to: 1) Test the efficacy of a mindfulness-based smoking cessation intervention enhanced by mHealth (iQuit Mindfully), compared to in- person mindfulness-based addiction treatment (MBAT) and usual care; and 2) Investigate the mechanisms through which MBAT and iQuit Mindfully impact smoking cessation using intensive daily diary assessment. This project aims to improve cessation outcomes for low-SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers by supplementing existing mindfulness treatment with innovative mHealth methods. Furthermore, we aim to advance the scientific study of mechanisms of action of mindfulness treatment, which could inform the development of more efficacious and efficient treatments to reduce tobacco-related cancer disparities.

"The Impact of Tobacco Control Policies on Health Equity in the United States Project Summary Abstract Since the mid-1900s, tobacco control policies have effectively decreased smoking prevalence in the United States. However, important disparities by socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity in smoking prevalence and tobacco-related health outcomes persist. People with relatively lower education and income are more likely to smoke than their more affluent counterparts. In addition, although non-Hispanic Blacks and non-Hispanic Whites have a similar prevalence of smoking, Blacks have lower quit rates and higher lung cancer incidence and mortality than Whites. Hispanics, on the other hand, smoke less than Blacks or Whites. This suggests that current tobacco control policies do not adequately reduce, let alone eliminate, smoking disparities in vulnerable subgroups. However, few policy evaluations address smoking disparities, and the effects of policies across different SES and racial/ethnic subgroups are mostly unknown. Moreover, tobacco control policies are generally designed with broad populations in mind, without a focus on reducing the prevalence of smoking among specific populations. As a consequence, some policies may actually be exacerbating smoking disparities, even if their net population effect is positive. The objective of this study is to determine the health equity impact of established and emerging tobacco control policies in the US. The proposed project will: (1) determine how tobacco control policies influence disparities in smoking initiation among youth; (2) determine how tobacco control policies influence disparities in smoking cessation among adults; and (3) predict which combination of policies are needed to reduce health disparities in tobacco- attributable mortality over time using a tobacco policy simulation model. Aims 1 and 2 will systematically analyze two large, nationally-representative surveys over time to determine the extent to which tobacco control policies in the US affect disparities for smoking initiation and cessation, focusing on the differential impact of policies by education, income, and race/ethnicity (i.e., Whites, Blacks, Hispanics), and their possible intersection with gender. Aim 3 will integrate the evidence developed in Aims 1 and 2 into a simulation model to predict how policies, individually and in combination, will affect smoking disparities and future downstream tobacco-attributable deaths. The proposed study will take the field beyond describing smoking disparities to producing concrete, actionable evidence informing which tobacco control policies may be most effective in simultaneously reducing both overall smoking and tobacco-related health disparities. Knowledge gained from this study will guide policy-makers’ decisions regarding implementation of specific tobacco control policies by highlighting the importance of considering their contribution to tobacco-related health disparities. Project Narrative The proposed study will examine how tobacco control policies in the US affect disparities by socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity in smoking initiation and cessation. Findings from this research will provide critical evidence to policy makers and public health professionals at the local, state, and national levels as they consider the implications of tobacco control policy choices on tobacco-related health disparities.",The Impact of Tobacco Control Policies on Health Equity in the United States,9830611,R37CA214787,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Canada ', ' Data Sources ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Investments ', ' Mass Media ', ' mass information media ', ' mortality ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Sales ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Taxation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Site ', ' Work Location ', ' Work Place ', ' Work-Site ', ' Worksite ', ' work setting ', ' Workplace ', ' population survey ', ' Label ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' lung cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Special Population ', ' named group ', ' success ', ' Media Campaign ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' tobacco policy ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' movie ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Modeling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Tobacco Control Research ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' attributable death ', ' attributable mortality ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' prospective ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' comparative ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' health equity ', ' clean indoor air law ', ' smoke-free air law ', ' smoke-free air policy ', ' smokefree air law ', ' smokefree policy ', ' smoke-free policy ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R37,2020,554510,0.27332454784652616
"Effect of the Housing and Urban Development’s Smokefree Public Housing Rule on Air Quality and Health in the District of Columbia Abstract The goal of this study is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the U.S. Housing and Urban Development's (HUDs) smoke-free public housing rule, effective August 3, 2018, in the District of Columbia Housing Authority. The rule prohibits lit tobacco products and hookah use in all living units, common areas, administrative office buildings, and outdoor areas up to 25 feet in all public housing facilities. A primary goal of the rule is to create healthier homes for families living in public housing. Tobacco use control laws that prohibit smoking in public places have helped reduce smoking prevalence by 40% and exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke by 71%. Even with declines in these indicators for the general population, progress has been considerably slower for low-income, racial and ethnic minorities who experience disproportionate harm from smoking and secondhand smoke exposure. Homes remain a significant source of SHSe due, in part, to the substantial amount of time adults and children spend in the home. SHSe is particularly problematic in multiunit housing, where secondhand smoke can enter non-smoking units through ventilation systems and other means. While a few studies suggest positive effects of smoke-free public housing on indoor air quality, SHSe, and smoking cessation, limitations exist. Namely, longitudinal studies with more than one post-intervention assessment, studies evaluating the effect on short- and long-term health outcomes, and studies that include objective measures of secondhand smoke exposure are needed. This study addresses the methodological limitations of current evaluation studies and is designed to evaluate the effect of HUDs rule specifically. A qualitative approach will be used to document the implementation process of the rule. A quantitative approach will be used to evaluate the effects of the rule on SHSe and health outcomes of adults and children. The evaluation will include three cohorts: a cohort of residences to assess the effect of HUDs policy on SHSe, a cohort of smoking adults to assess effects of the rule on smoking behavior, and a cohort of youth with asthma to assess effects of the rule on children's respiratory health. Baseline data collection will occur prior to August 2018, and funding from the proposed study will be used for four post-implementation assessments (up to 24-months post rule). Differential effects of the rule will be examined across family and senior/disabled communities. Evaluating this rule is critical, given that over 2 million public housing residents will be effected and the potential for this rule to reduce tobacco-related health disparities. Processes found to be effective in the current study have the potential to accelerate the implementation of tobacco control policies in the future.

"Beyond demographics: Mixed-methods research for effective communication tools to prevent tobacco use in Hispanic adolescents and young adults PROJECT SUMMARY Health communication campaigns are a critical part of tobacco control policy, but may exacerbate health disparities if they are not thoughtfully designed. Specifically, communication campaigns tend to benefit more advantaged populations (e.g., non-Hispanic white, higher SES) while failing to reach or resonate with more disadvantaged populations. Moreover, these disadvantaged populations are exposed to tobacco marketing at disproportionately high rates. These communication inequalities can result in disparities in the rates of tobacco use. To address these health disparities, tobacco prevention campaigns must (1) be based on in-depth formative evidence in order to reach and resonate with groups most at risk for tobacco use, and (2) successfully compete with and counteract the effects of pro-tobacco marketing. This requires going beyond simple demographic targeting (by race, SES, etc.) to produce messages that deeply resonate with the target population’s social and cultural lives. To accomplish this, the proposed study uses an innovative blend of methods to understand tobacco use among Hispanic adolescents and young adults. Hispanics have higher rates of susceptibility to tobacco use, and comprise approximately one quarter of the US youth population, making them an important group for tobacco control. Moreover, much research on Hispanics fails to examine the considerable differences in this population by ethnic heritage (e.g., Mexican, Cuban, etc.). The current project will (Aim 1) Identify unique and cross-cutting psychological, social and cultural influences on tobacco use among Hispanic youth and young adults at-risk for tobacco use, and (Aim 2) Describe the pro-tobacco communications environment to which Hispanic youth are exposed. Aim 1 will be accomplished through a mix of online discussions and in-person focus groups. Online discussions are an innovative technique that allow us to obtain a diverse sample of Hispanic 15-21 year olds to examine key sub-group differences. In-person focus groups will be held in four US MSAs with the highest number of Hispanics. The in-person focus groups allow us to focus more intensely on key themes identified in the online discussions. The focus groups will use innovative techniques to access thoughts, opinions and motivations that may be difficult for participants to articulate, and will produce a deep understanding of tobacco use in this population. Aim 2 will conduct a content analysis of tobacco marketing targeting Hispanics. We will use data from the content analysis to identify key marketing tactics, and will obtain focus group participants’ perspectives on these tactics. Ultimately, these findings will be disseminated to stakeholders in collaboration with our partners at Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids (CTFK). We will develop an online toolkit that stakeholders can access on-demand, webinars to provide more focused education, and will work with CTFK to integrate our findings into their trainings. Ultimately, this project will produce novel, in-depth information to support efforts to communicate more effectively about tobacco with Hispanic youth and young adults, and to restrict tobacco marketing targeting youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project addresses communication inequalities that underlie tobacco-related health disparities. We will use an innovative blend of online discussions, in-person focus groups, and content analysis to generate sociocultural maps to tobacco use among Hispanic youth and young adults. With our study partners at Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and youth advisory board, we will disseminate these findings to stakeholders in the US to support tobacco prevention campaign development and efforts to restrict tobacco marketing.",Beyond demographics: Mixed-methods research for effective communication tools to prevent tobacco use in Hispanic adolescents and young adults,9882971,R21CA229334,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Industry ', ' Language ', ' Maps ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Perception ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Tobacco ', ' Work ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Mexican ', ' Inequality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' behavior change ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' cancer risk ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' tobacco policy ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Subgroup ', ' Communication Tools ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' tobacco control ', ' tobacco ads ', ' tobacco marketing ', ' tobacco advertising ', ' prevent tobacco use ', ' tobacco use prevention ', ' tobacco prevention ', ' exposure to tobacco ', ' tobacco exposure ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' 21 years of age ', ' age 21 ', ' age 21 years ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' twenty-one years of age ', ' 21 year old ', ' demographics ', ' evidence base ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' webinar ', ' Cuban ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' tobacco-free ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,178346,0.09625868425402939
"A Scalable e-Health Smoking Cessation Intervention for Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Veterans PROJECT SUMMARY Although cigarette smoking rates have declined in the US over the past 50 years, there has been an upturn in smoking among military personnel in the last several decades. With over 8 million Veteran enrollees, the Veterans Health Administration serves 75% of low-income and disabled Veterans. Less than 5% of Veterans receiving care through VHA access intensive treatment for smoking cessation, and these services employ a standard approach to cessation counseling that is most relevant for smokers who are ready to quit. To optimize acceptability, reach, and effectiveness, cessation treatments for Veteran smokers should be appropriate for all levels of readiness to quit. A web-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy program, Flexiquit, has shown great promise in increasing quit rates for smokers in all stages of readiness to quit (52% vs. 14% in a wait-list control group). Web-based delivery makes the program readily scalable to the population level. In this study, we propose development and pilot testing of Vet Flexiquit, an adaptation of Flexiquit for US Veteran cigarette smokers. The study will be conducted in two phases. The first phase will consist of adaptation and iterative usability testing with low-income Veteran smokers (n=20). The second phase will be a pilot feasibility trial (n=50) comparing Vet Flexiquit to the SmokefreeVET web site. The primary goals of the pilot study are to compare Vet Flexiquit to SmokefreeVET on acceptability (i.e., user satisfaction and number of log-ins) and efficacy for impacting theory-based change processes and promoting smoking cessation. This pilot project is significant and innovative in four key respects: (1) it addresses the top cause of cancer and other preventable diseases among socioeconomically disadvantaged US Veterans served by VHA, (2) it applies a novel treatment approach and advances the science of ACT for smoking cessation by testing its effectiveness for smokers at all stages of readiness to quit rather than only among smokers who are ready to quit, (3) web- based delivery has high potential reach, cost-effectiveness, and scalability within VHA, a health care setting where tobacco cessation is under-resourced; and (4) gamification and inclusion of virtual coaches as engagement strategies are substantially different than standard web-based tobacco treatments, including SmokefreeVET. If found to be effective in a larger trial, Vet Flexiquit would be well-positioned for VHA-wide scale-up due to its low maintenance cost and high potential reach, and the core program could be built upon in innovative ways (e.g., capability for virtual coaches to understand and respond to natural language) to further improve engagement and outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Smoking prevalence among Veterans is higher than the general population, in part because current treatment options do not address their needs. A targeted web-based intervention employing a novel treatment approach and designed for smokers at all stages of quit readiness could improve both the reach and efficacy of treatment for Veteran smokers and have high public health impact as a means of reducing the smoking prevalence in this tobacco-related health disparities population.",A Scalable e-Health Smoking Cessation Intervention for Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Veterans,9912129,R21CA236980,"['Attention ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Control Groups ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Health ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Methodology ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military ', ' Motivation ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Relapse ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Smoking ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' Public Health Service ', ' USPHS ', ' Veterans ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Measures ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Caring ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' health administration ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Biochemical ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' satisfaction ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' integrated health system ', ' integrated healthcare systems ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Cigarette Smoker ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' success ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' craving ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Low income ', ' tobacco-induced cancer ', ' tobacco-related cancer ', ' Tobacco-Related Carcinoma ', ' Address ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' virtual human ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Abstinence ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' usability ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' natural language ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' e-Health ', ' eHealth ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' feasibility trial ', ' virtual coach ', ' ']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R21,2020,202383,0.28400001369561373

"Geographic variation in the diverse tobacco retail environment and its impact on tobacco use disparities ABSTRACT Amid declining cigarette consumption, sales of non-cigarette tobacco products remain strong. Importantly, the diverse products available in the current tobacco marketplace pose different levels of harm to the user. Combustible products such as cigarettes and cigars are higher on the tobacco risk continuum than non- combustible products such as smokeless tobacco and electronic cigarettes (e-cigs). Conceivably, smokers who switch to a non-combustible product may reduce their risk of smoking-related disease. This behavior, however, is significantly more common among whites compared to blacks, who have the highest rates of combustible tobacco use of any racial or ethnic group. Indeed, cigarette smoking rates are declining faster among whites than blacks, potentially driven by e-cig uptake. Differential rates of quitting smoking by switching to e-cigs or other non-combustible products may exacerbate existing health disparities between whites and blacks. Although tobacco use is influenced by several individual, interpersonal, and societal factors, the retail environment is known to play a critical role in shaping smoking behaviors, particularly among racial minorities, whom the tobacco industry has historically exploited. Despite the growing popularity of e-cigs and other non- cigarette tobacco products, little is known about the promotion of these products at the point-of-sale. This project will examine how the retail of diverse tobacco products varies across the U.S. and the extent to which it is associated with use behaviors of community residents. Specifically, this study will 1) investigate the relationship between regional tobacco product sales, tobacco control policies, and community demographics using Nielsen market scanner data and census data, 2) document the association between the local tobacco retail environment and tobacco product use using geocoded data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and store audits, and 3) model smoking-related disparities attributed to changes in tobacco use behaviors using repeated cross-sectional NHIS data and longitudinal data from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study. PROJECT NARRATIVE The current tobacco marketplace in the United States is more diverse than ever, with consumption of cigars, smokeless tobacco, and electronic cigarettes remaining strong amid declining cigarette consumption.

"Adapt2Quit – A Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational System: RCT for Socio-Economically Disadvantaged smokers” 7. Project Summary We will test Adapt2Quit, an innovative Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational Messaging System. Adapt2Quit uses complex, machine-learning algorithms to adaptively select the best messages for a smoker, based upon multiple attributes, including: 1) the smoker’s profile; 2) the smoker’s explicit feedback over time to the system; and 3) data from thousands of prior smokers’ profiles and their feedback patterns. Adapt2Quit’s type of machine- learning is called a recommender system. Outside healthcare, companies (like Amazon) use recommender systems to continuously learn from user feedback (e.g.: liked product, products purchased) to improve, thus enhancing personal relevance and customer engagement. Engagement is a huge challenge for digital health. In the field of computer-tailored health messaging, Adapt2Quit is the first to use machine-learning to continuously adapt to feedback and select new personalized messages to send to smokers. To evaluate the impact of the recommender system, Adapt2Quit will be compared with a robust, active control, a simple but effective messaging system. In our pilot experiment, Adapt2Quit outperformed the control, especially among socio- economically disadvantaged (SED) smokers. SED smokers are harder to engage in interventions. Thus, Adapt2Quit’s increased engagement will be of particular importance for targeting SED smokers. In addition to the potential impact of the Adapt2Quit messages in inducing and engaging smokers in cessation, our goal is to increase use of the state Quitline. We will recruit 700 SED smokers at two sites. All smokers will complete a baseline interview and receive a paper brochure with information about the state’s Quitline. Smokers will then be randomized to: Adapt2Quit or the standard messaging. As the system is designed to enhance engagement, and through engagement lead to positive actions, Aim 1 will focus on engagement [Hypothesis (H1a) Among Adapt2Quit smokers, those with higher engagement levels (completed more ratings) will have greater scores on the perceived competence scale (PCS)]. Aim 2 compares (Adapt2Quit and control) behavior change processes including perceived competence for smoking cessation and cessation supporting actions (calling a Quitline) [H2a: Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater scores on the PCS than control smokers; H2b: Adapt2Quit smokers will adopt more cessation supporting actions (Quitline, NRT) than control smokers]. Aim 3 will assess effectiveness of the system [H3a: (primary outcome) Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater smoking cessation rates (6-month point prevalence biochemically verified) than control smokers; H3b: (secondary outcome) Adapt2Quit smokers will have lower time to first quit attempt than control smokers; H3c: (mediation analysis) Measured internal and external processes will mediate the effect of Adapt2Quit on smoking cessation]. To accomplish the above aims, we have brought together a multidisciplinary team with relevant expertise, and a strong track record of collaboration. 8. Narrative We propose testing Adapt2Quit — an innovative motivational texting “recommender system.” Adapt2Quit enhances tailored motivational messaging systems using machine-learning algorithms to learn from, and adapt to, user feedback (prior and daily message ratings), thereby increasing message personal relevance.

"Circadian and sleep mechanisms among racial groups for nicotine dependence, craving, and withdrawal PROJECT SUMMARY The number one preventable cause of death in the world is tobacco use. Cigarette smoking in particular, costs an estimated $300 billion due to expenses related to medical care and lost productivity. Despite similar smoking prevalence rates, Blacks suffer disproportionately from smoking-related harms compared to Whites. Sleep disparities such as shortened sleep duration, shorter circadian periodicity, earlier chronotype, and increased variability of sleep timing have been reported more frequently in Blacks compared to Whites. Given that poor sleep quality predicts relapse from smoking cessation programs, particularly among socioeconomically disadvantaged adults, sleep deficiencies and irregular timing of sleep may impact smoking craving and withdrawal symptoms over the course of the 24-hour day. Surprisingly, few studies have examined these temporal patterns of smoking and craving, and none with regard to sleep disruption, chronotype or racial disparities. A better understanding of these factors may explain heterogeneity within the smoking population, especially in minorities. Thus, the purpose of this proposal is to test the central hypothesis that the impact of chronotype and impaired sleep on cigarette usage as well as smoking dependence, urge/craving, and withdrawal depends on race. Three specific aims will determine: contributions of sleep timing and sleep quality and quantity to racial disparities in smoking status (Aim 1), objective sleep characteristics and smoking behavior among blacks and whites who smoke cigarettes (Aim 2), and whether sleep restriction modifies craving and withdrawal in racially diverse smokers (Aim 3). Specifically, we will utilize self-report questionnaires, objective measures of sleep quality and timing (actigraphy) and circadian phase (dim light melatonin onset), as well as ecological momentary assessment of cigarette use, smoking urges, cravings, and withdrawal symptoms to identify circadian and sleep characteristics that are most strongly associated with smoking status, heaviness of smoking and dependence among blacks and whites. Finally, we will test whether acute sleep restriction (4 hours of time-in- bed) versus sleep extension (10 hours of time-in-bed) modifies craving and withdrawal symptoms following cessation in black and white smokers. If successful, the results of this study will result in identification of circadian dysfunction and insufficient sleep as mechanisms that underlie the association between sleep and cigarette smoking behaviors and dependence in diverse populations. Moreover, these findings are likely to inform clinicians of the importance of sleep and sleep timing on cigarette smoking behaviors and dependence that will help in the development of novel interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality caused by tobacco use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cigarette smoking and nicotine dependence have been associated with delayed sleep timing, poor sleep quality and quantity, as well as sleep disordered breathing and insomnia. Our goal is to identify the contributing factors to smoking status, determine circadian characteristics of smoking behavior, and to determine the effects of acute sleep restriction on smoking withdrawal in racially diverse populations. Overall, this study will help to identify targets for smoking cessation strategies as well as lead to novel therapeutic interventions for sleep disruption and smoking abstinence, particularly among ethnic minorities.","Circadian and sleep mechanisms among racial groups for nicotine dependence, craving, and withdrawal",9976302,R01DA046096,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Beds ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Melatonin ', ' Memory ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Tobacco retail policy innovation to reduce health disparities ABSTRACT The significant progress made toward ending the tobacco epidemic has primarily resulted from policy changes, including tobacco tax increases and smokefree policies. However, research suggests that even if progress on existing prevention and cessation programs is accelerated, an end to the tobacco epidemic is unlikely to be achieved without additional policy innovations. The tobacco retail environment has become a focus of current tobacco control policy conversations, with studies exploring the impact of reduced retailer density. An as yet unstudied approach is using the existing infrastructure of states with alcohol (or potentially marijuana) control retail systems to restrict tobacco sales. Transitioning tobacco sales (TTS) to state retail outlets would enable states to increase control over price, point-of-sale advertising, numbers and types of brands, hours, and outlet density. Disadvantaged communities could experience the greatest benefit, given the current concentration of tobacco outlets in lower income and racially diverse neighborhoods. However, no research has assessed the feasibility, obstacles to and potential health and revenue effects of such a move.The overall objective of this project is to evaluate the prospects for and potential impact of implementing TTS as a way to reduce tobacco accessibility, tobacco use, and tobacco-related health disparities. The project's specific aims are: Specific Aim #1: Conduct a comprehensive appraisal of the potential for and obstacles to moving sales of combustible tobacco products to state retail outlets in 12 states with such systems for alcohol control and sales, and in 2 potential marijuana control states; Specific Aim #2: Examine the extent to which economic and other disparities in the retail accessibility of tobacco could be reduced by limiting sales to state-controlled liquor stores; Specific Aim #3: Using a validated tobacco control simulation model, analyze the impact on smoking prevalence, smoking attributable deaths, health-related outcomes, and state revenues of moving tobacco product sales to state-controlled liquor outlets. This research answers a recent call by the Tobacco Control Research Priorities Working Group of the NCI Board of Scientific Advisors for research on innovative tobacco control policy initiatives that are potentially transformative. Pinpointing the health and economic impacts of moving tobacco sales to state-run stores could lay the groundwork for policymaker consideration of this or more incremental retailer reduction measures. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tobacco use is the most important preventable cause of death and disease in the United States and contributes to health disparities. Progress toward ending the tobacco epidemic has primarily resulted from policy changes.

"Integrating Longitudinal Data to Examine Directional, Synergistic and Differential Effects of Tobacco Control Policies on Smoking Abstract Although significant progress has been made in reducing smoking rates in the United States, one in seven Americans continues to smoke, and smoking remains the leading preventable cause of death in this country. Evidence suggests that tobacco control policies, including cigarette excise taxes, smokefree air laws and tobacco control program funding, can effectively reduce tobacco consumption in general. What remains unknown are which combinations of tobacco control policies are most effective, whether policy-related gains can be maintained during periods of policy retrenchment, and whether tobacco policies can shrink strong socioeconomic smoking disparities. To examine these questions, we propose to develop and analyze a dataset that integrates longitudinal observations of individual smoking behavior with measures of state and local tobacco control policy exposure, as well as area measures of socioeconomic status. Using repeated observations of 18,407 individuals' smoking behavior as policies change in their home state, county or city, or as they move to a new place with different policies, we aim to identify whether changes in adult smoking behavior following exposure to stronger tobacco control policies are the inverse of changes in behavior observed following exposure to weaker policies, and assess which policy combinations are most likely to be effective in the current context. By incorporating measures of individual and area income and educational status, we further aim to estimate the impact of single and combined tobacco control policy options on socioeconomic disparities in smoking. Our team has expertise in several areas, including tobacco control, policy evaluation and longitudinal data analysis. This innovative policy analysis method could be used to complement more traditional policy evaluation techniques for other health-related policies as well. Project Narrative State and local tobacco control policies have contributed to the decline in overall tobacco use over the last half century, but further policy progress has recently stalled, and socioeconomic disparities in smoking remain strong. Whether policy-related gains can be maintained during periods of policy retrenchment, the most effective combinations of tobacco control policies, and whether tobacco policies can shrink socioeconomic smoking disparities remains unclear. In the proposed project, we aim to integrate individual smoking information from a national longitudinal dataset currently under-utilized in tobacco research with state and local measures of tobacco control policies, in order to estimate directional, synergistic and differential policy effects on smoking.","Integrating Longitudinal Data to Examine Directional, Synergistic and Differential Effects of Tobacco Control Policies on Smoking",10022100,R21CA222525,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Air ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Cities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Environment ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Laws ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Taxes ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Evaluation ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' high school ', ' Municipalities ', ' Cigarette ', ' Participant ', ' tobacco control policy ', ' tobacco policy ', ' public policy on tobacco ', ' Modeling ', ' Drops ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' trend ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' reduction in tobacco use ', ' tobacco use reduction ', ' reduce tobacco use ', ' smoking prevalence ', ' tobacco control ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Consumption ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' evidence base ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' clean indoor air law ', ' smoke-free air law ', ' smoke-free air policy ', ' smokefree air law ', ' smokefree policy ', ' smoke-free policy ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' panel study of income dynamics ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2020,162683,0.2367785633955577
"Impact of smoking and its cessation on systemic and airway immune activation PROJECT SUMMARY The exceedingly high rate of smoking and its substantial contribution to morbidity and mortality in the HIV- infected population despite effective ART makes smoking a major health risk in the HIV-infected population. The mechanism by which smoking exerts synergistic effects on HIV-induced immune dysfunction remains unclear. Our central hypothesis is that the persistent HIV-induced immune dysfunction leaves the lung exceeding vulnerable to further insults by smoking. Smoking further drives immune-mediate pathways, such as increase in oxidative stress and inflammation, to cause further local tissue destruction. The lung pathology can result in activation of latently infected alveolar macrophages in the lung to produce low level HIV viremia, and perpetuates this pro-inflammatory environment. Additionally, the chronic oxidative imbalance can cause not only local tissue damage but cellular DNA damage, which results in epithelial gene expression alterations. Aim 1 seeks to identify in a cross-sectional study of ART-treated HIV smokers chronic immune effects of smoking by evaluating for differences in cytokine profile and immune cell phenotype and ROS production of cells isolated in the airways and blood from HIV-infected never smokers. The relationships of these local and systemic immune perturbations with airway epithelial gene transcriptome and evidence of residual viremia will be evaluated to identify biological pathways by which smoking interacts with HIV immune dysfunction. In Aim 2 to further test the hypothesis we propose a proof-of-concept smoking cessation clinical study to assess the degree and nature of reversibility of lung damage among HIV smokers who achieve smoking cessation compared to those who continue to smoke. In this single site study, we will employ an intensive smoking cessation program to help study participants who are recruited from a large urban HIV-infected outpatient clinic where a unique integrated clinical research infrastructure is in place, achieve smoking cessation. Longitudinally samples will be collected pre-cessation and post-cessation from those who are able to achieve 10-week cessation from the lung and blood. We will evaluate the change in level of inflammation, immune activation and oxidative stress, and determine if these immune-mediate pathways are related to changes in HIV residual viremia and epithelial gene expression in the lung. Lastly, leveraging existing resources, we will compare these finding to those in uninfected smokers from banked samples collected already by our collaborator. This smoking cessation study in HIV-infected patients will be the first of its kind, with longitudinal specimen collection from both the lung and blood compartments, and utilizing translational approaches through collaborations with experts in virology, immunology, gene transcription and health disparity research. Understanding the relative contribution and pathways by which smoking interacts with immune activation and inflammation characteristic of chronic HIV disease will help guide development of therapeutic interventions to halt or reverse these pathological processes and ensuing clinical disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Smoking is a major and urgent public health issue for the HIV-infected population. Understanding the pathways by which smoking adversely interacts with HIV-induced immune dysfunction in the lung is critical to address this urgent public health concern. This study will address the immunological effects of smoking and subsequent cessation on lung inflammation and oxidative stress, and the ensuing change in HIV residual viremia in the lung compartment and airway epithelial gene expression alterations. Overall, the data from this study will fill a critical gap in the literature, offering potential mechanistic pathways by which smoking interacts with HIV- induced immune dysfunction in the lung and then systemically, and offer targets for future interventions.",Impact of smoking and its cessation on systemic and airway immune activation,9948609,R01DA042685,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Ambulatory Care Facilities ', ' Outpatient Clinics ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Bacterial Pneumonia ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA Damage ', ' DNA Injury ', ' Epithelial Cells ', ' Epithelium ', ' Epithelium Part ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune System Dysfunction ', ' Immune System and Related Disorders ', ' Immunodeficiency and Immunosuppression Disorders ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunological Dysfunction ', ' Immunological System Dysfunction ', ' Inflammation ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Lung ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Morbidity -
