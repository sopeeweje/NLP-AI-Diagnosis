"EMPIRICAL TEST OF THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF HEALTH Inverse relationships between socioeconomic status (SES) and                     mortality and morbidity rates have been documented for almost every              disease and condition.  People of low SES have financial barriers that           impede access to health care, the primary barrier being lack of health           insurance.  Despite the enactment of Medicaid, income-related health             services disparities persist even after accounting for need.  Health             policy debates over the last several decades have considered initiatives         that would guarantee universal coverage to all individuals in the                United States in an attempt to ameliorate the persistent inequalities in         health and health care.  Arguments have been made, however, that                 access to health care will not be sufficient to substantially reduce the         social inequalities in health since countries that have universal health         insurance show the same SES-health gradient as found in the United               States.  The Epidemiology of Health framework, based on the                      previous works of Blum, Lalonde, Milio, conceptualizes health as a               function of four contributing factors: biology, environment, lifestyle,          and use of health care services.  Guided by this conceptual framework,           the proposed study will test the Epidemiology of Health model.                   Additionally, this study will quantify the determinants of health in a           national sample, identify inequities in the determinants of health               between the poor and nonpoor, and determine the role of insurance in             abating inequities. The proposed study will test the Epidemiology of             Health framework using latent variable structural equation modeling              with LISREL7 of a cross-sectional, national sample from the 1993                 National Health Interview Survey.  The conceptual model contains five            constructs that have driven the development of a quantifiable empirical          model.  The empirical model consists of the latent outcome variable,             health, whose relationships with predictor variables will be measured            by conceptually meaningful and quantitatively derived manifest                   variables within the dataset.

"MEASURING THE QUALITY OF CARE FOR DIABETES Approximately 16 million Americans suffer from diabetes - one half of them estimated to have undiagnosed disease.  Diabetes disproportionately affects low-income and minority populations and is one of the six target conditions under the President s Initiative to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health. While diabetes has to potential for severe and long-lasting health complications, the condition can be well-managed on an ambulatory basis.  Treatment of diabetes is marked by clear guidelines on the appropriate content of care, and wide variation in the extent to which these guidelines are adhered to in practice.  There are high potential costs associated with inadequately treated diabetes, which makes improving quality of ambulatory services for diabetes a priority.  In order to improve the care received by patients with diabetes, it is necessary to monitor the quality of care across many settings, routinely and at low cost. This research will use the Medicaid SMRF data sets from 6 states to develop a claims and administrative record-based system for measuring the quality of diabetes care.  This study will: 1. Develop a set of quality care measures for diabetes based on information reported in claims files.  2. Assess the ability of these measures to reflect variations in the quality of care.  3.

"Medicare + Choice and Minority Elderly  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medicare is specifically mandated to provide health care services to elderly and/or disabled United States residents, as well as those with end stage renal disease. Although Medicare has been successful in dramatically improving both the access to care and the overall health of its constituents, studies have shown inequalities in care associated with the race/ethnicity of Medicare beneficiaries. On the surface, Medicare health maintenance organizations (HMOs) appear to address some of the factors associated with these inequalities, however, the Medicare HMO program, now called Medicare+Choice (M+C), is itself undergoing substantial program changes as a result of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) and subsequent revisions, e.g., the Balanced Budget Revision Act (BBRA) and the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA). This study has two broad objectives. First, we will determine individual level characteristics related to M+C plan enrollment among elderly White, Black, and Hispanic Medicare beneficiaries, whether the factors which elderly Black and Hispanic beneficiaries report as influencing their enrollment in HMOs differ from those that influence elderly White Medicare beneficiaries, and whether elderly Black and Hispanic beneficiaries enrolled in HMOs differ from HMO enrolled elderly White beneficiaries in terms of their self-reported health, use of health care, and perceived access to care. Second, we will examine the availability of Medicare HMOs and benefit packages for beneficiaries of differing race/ethnic classifications, how HMO enrollment rates are related to race/ethnic classification and range of plan benefits, and how the availability of HMOs and HMO enrollment by different race/ethnic groups changed subsequent to implementation of BBA provisions. We will use both survey and population-based (using Medicare administrative data and other population-based data) methodologies to examine individual and system level factors affecting access to and use of medical care, the availability of plans and services, and plan selection by enrollees. This study will provide the first comprehensive examination of both individual and system level factors affecting minority use of the Medicare HMOs, and will provide needed information on how the evolving Medicare system is affecting health care for Black and Hispanic Medicare beneficiaries.

"Medicare Policy and Aging in the U.S. and Canada  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We investigate the effect of universal health insurance coverage on health outcomes and the use of health services by exploiting a natural experiment that changes the insurance status of most Americans at age 65, that is, eligibility for the U S Medicare program Since instance status is not randomly assigned, correctly identifying a causal relationship between insurance status and health is notoriously difficult This study will employ panel data from the Health and Retirement Study in the U S to estimate the effect of turning 65 and becoming Medicare eligible on health status and the user of health services The Clinton Administration's 1998 introduction of legislation seeking to expand Medicare coverage to many individuals in the 55-to-64 year age group (a group often referred to as the ""near elderly"") has since spawned considerable interest among policy analysts who have sought to document the insurance, health and employment status of this age group The enclosed study explores the possible benefits of such a proposal by examining the effect of obtaining Medicare coverage on the health of previously uninsured individuals in the near elderly group Many researchers both in the U S and abroad have documented that socioeconomic differences in health tend to be largest in middle age (prior to age 65), and decline at older ages The proposed study will also fill a large gap in this literature on converging socioeconomic inequalities in health over the lifecycle by exploring the role of universal health I insurance coverage in producing these patterns In particular, we will compare differences in health just before and after the age of 65 in the U S to differences between comparable ages in Canada, where Medicare is a universal program and eligibility is not conditioned on age.

"Healthcare Access for Children of the Working Poor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Working poor families, who earn less than 200% of the federal poverty level, have long been overlooked by researchers and policy makers.  Despite their low earnings, adults in these families have not relied on public assistance and historically have not qualified for means-tested insurance programs such as Medicaid.  As a result, working poor families, many of whom do not receive health insurance benefits through their employer, have had difficulties accessing healthcare and meeting their healthcare needs.  With welfare reform setting short lifetime limits on the receipt of welfare and imposing work requirements, more families are transitioning into the ranks of the working poor.  Even though California is the most expensive state to reside in, its working poor families (18% of the state population) have the lowest average income in the nation.  In California, a large proportion of working poor families are immigrants. Evidence suggests that immigrant working poor children experience even greater difficulties in access to care.  In an effort to minimize these disparities, California has recently expanded health insurance coverage for eligible working poor children and their parents.  Yet there has been no population-based study to monitor the impact of these expansions.      The proposed study will analyze data from the 2001 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) in an aim to fill gaps in knowledge of the extent to which children of the working poor access and utilize health services.  Specifically, it will 1) compare access and utilization of healthcare among working poor children with children in other socioeconomic strata; 2) explore the differences in access and utilization of healthcare between immigrant and native born children of the working poor; and 3) assess the extent to which expansions in health coverage for working poor parents can improve access and use of health services for their children.      CHIS, the largest cross-sectional state health survey of the civilian population ever conducted in the US, offers an excellent opportunity to examine healthcare access for working poor families.  The sampling frame, language capabilities, and 70% response rate for adults indicate that the data are likely to be representative of the California population.  Because this is the first large-scale data collection effort since California expanded health insurance access for the working poor, CHIS data will allow this study to monitor the extent to which these policies have affected access to and use of healthcare and the extent to which, by expanding insurance coverage for parents, children's access to care may also improve.  Further, it will allow for an assessment of the extent to which legal status influences access to and use of health services for working poor immigrants in California.  This study will help policy makers understand the determinants of access to care and use of health services as a first step towards assessing the quality of care for children of the working poor.

"RACIAL DISPARITIES AND MEDICARE PREVENTIVE SERVICES The proposed research responds to the NIA Pilot Research Grant Program objective to ""Reduce Health Disparities Among Older Persons and Populations"" by examining topic number 20, ""Racial/Ethnic Differences and Health Disparities."" Although disparities in health care use and outcomes across racial and ethnic groups are well documented, the reasons for such disparities are poorly understood. It has been shown that minorities use fewer preventive services, and suffer higher rates of illnesses targeted by such preventions than other groups. The proposed research will use Medicare's expansion of preventive services coverage during the 1990's as a ""natural experiment"" to test whether insurance coverage of preventive services reduces racial and ethnic disparities in health care and health outcomes in an elderly population. The specific aims are: 1) to examine how expansions in the coverage of Medicare preventive services during the 1990s (influenza shots, mammography, and colorectal cancer screens) affected racial disparities in the receipt of these services; and 2) to examine whether changes in Medicare coverage of influenza shots, mammography, and colorectal cancer screens led to measurable changes in health outcomes related to these services. Using two publicly available data sources and a unique panel of seriously ill Medicare beneficiaries and spouses followed during the 1990s, the proposed research will use a difference-in-differences strategy to compare differential service use and differential health outcomes across racial and ethnic groups before and after Medicare coverage expansions.

"Effects of Managed Care Growth on Charity Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The candidate's most general career goal is to independently conduct high quality research that will leverage improvements in access to health services.  A related career goal is to advance theoretical understanding of transformations of public health and medical systems and how these changes affect access to services by vulnerable populations.  His proposed research agenda and training program have been fashioned to catalyze development of research skills needed to meet his research and career goals.  The proposed research agenda is to study several mechanisms through which increases in managed care may have affected provision of care for the uninsured by local health departments (LHDs) and physicians.  The candidate will examine the extent to which increases in managed care have: a) diverted Medicaid revenues away from LHDs, reducing their cross-subsidization and provision of care for the uninsured; and b) decreased the Medicaid revenue and overall revenue of physicians, leading to a decrease in their provision of charity care.  He also will examine the extent to which increases in managed care have: a) decreased physicians' autonomy (indicated by decreased ownership, decreased perceived clinical freedom, and increased size of practice), leading to decreased charity care; and b) increased discontinuation and privatization of LHD services resulting in a decrease in LHDs' ability to assure access of the uninsured.  This research will aid development of strategies for improving access to health services among the uninsured.  The analyses will require that the candidate learn new techniques of statistical analyses and application of theories from the fields of health economics and the sociology of health institutions and professions.

"Cost-Related Underuse of Medications in the Elderly    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since Medicare was enacted in 1965, the program has excluded coverage for outpatient prescription medications except for injection drugs furnished by a physician. It is now widely recognized that the elderly face an erosion of prescription benefits as insurers respond to mounting fiscal pressures with a variety of cost-cutting and cost-shifting measures. Medicare beneficiaries must rely on a range of supplemental sources to help with drug expenses. The Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), administered annually to a representative national sample of elderly and disabled adults enrolled in Medicare, represents the gold standard for information on rates and sources of prescription coverage among elderly Americans. However the MCBS provides little information on cost-related non-compliance with medication regimens, and there are no other national data sources. While preliminary research documents the relationships among out-of-pocket medication costs, rates of non-compliance, and adverse clinical outcomes, no national study to date has addressed whether such cost-related barriers lead to under use of essential drugs for chronic illnesses, substitution of over-the-counter or alternative medicines, or reductions in physician visits. This project will establish a permanent, ongoing national data resource that permits policymakers and researchers to measure, monitor, and identify changes in cost-related under use of medications (CRUM) among elderly Medicare beneficiaries. We will develop new, comprehensive measures of CRUM; validate the measures in a survey of approximately 200 elderly enrollees in a large health plan; integrate the measures in the MCBS for annual surveys of approximately 15,000 non-institutionalized elderly Medicare enrollees (the cost of which will be borne by the US Department of Health and Human Services, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services); and analyze MCBS data to identify the extent to which CRUM is associated with patient socio-demographics, health status and medical conditions, source of prescription coverage, and out-of-pocket prescription costs.         ",Cost-Related Underuse of Medications in the Elderly,6671149,R01AG022362,"['human old age (65+) ', ' chronic disease /disorder ', ' drug quality /standard ', ' drug /agent ', ' chemotherapy ', ' health care quality ', ' health care cost /financing ', ' Medicare /Medicaid ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' health behavior ', ' low income ', ' therapy compliance ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIA,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R01,2003,327583,0.0781241416994381
"Cancer-Related Disparities in the Elderly Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although cancer is the second leading cause of death in the elderly population, there is evidence that older Americans are less likely to be diagnosed at early stages of cancer, or to receive potentially curative treatment for early stages of cancer.  The disparities are especially pronounced for members of lower socioeconomic groups.  Despite the nearly universal Medicare coverage, the out-of-pocket expenses may present significant financial burden to elderly individuals with limited resources, which implies a greater likelihood to delay or not to seek preventive, routine, or screening services.  With respect to cancer-related outcomes, this translates into advanced stages of cancer upon diagnosis, and sub-optimal treatment and follow-up care, therefore poor prognosis.  The proposed studies will compare cancer-related outcomes (stage at diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care) among individuals >= 65 years of age diagnosed with breast, prostate, or colon cancer during the study period, 1998-2002.  Comparisons will be aimed at identifying disparities by age, race, comorbidities, socioeconomic status, and Medicaid status.  The study will link the Ohio Cancer Incidence Surveillance System (OCISS) with Medicare and Medicaid files, in order to identify Medicare-only, and dually eligible Medicare-Medicaid eligible individuals.  Data from the U.S. Census will be used to derive measures of socioeconomic status in the Medicare-only population.  The research plan outlined in this proposal will be complemented by a detailed training plan to enhance the Candidate's skills in relation to measuring cancer disparities, and in analyzing the findings in the context of health care policy relevant to cancer prevention and control.

"WHOM DOES MEDICARE BENEFIT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in Medicare claims payments has transferred resources away from younger cohorts to elderly cohorts. Less clear, however, is the way in which Medicare redistributes resources within cohorts. While disadvantaged groups pay fewer Medicare taxes, they also tend to die earlier and receive fewer Medicare benefits. We propose to use several new data sources to investigate whether Medicare redistributes resources towards disadvantaged groups within a cohort, and whether it improves the welfare of any or all these groups.  We will compare less educated people to the more educated, non-whites to whites, and smokers to nonsmokers.  Our calculations will be based primarily on individual-level data on Medicare benefits from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, and on individual-level longitudinal data on lifetime Medicare taxes paid from the Health and Retirement Study's Earnings History Files. Our approach differs from previous research in its use of individual-level data, which--unlike the previous studies of geographically aggregated Medicare claims data--seem to reveal an extremely high degree of progressivity in Medicare. Our data suggests that disadvantaged people--who are sicker--receive more Medicare benefits, even though average Medicare claims are higher in richer areas. As a result, the cash value of Medicare seems to be higher for poorer groups. We propose at least two reasons for this result: health care price levels are higher in richer areas, so that geographic variation in health care expenditures can be misleading; in addition, richer areas will tend to have better health care facilities and will thus attract sicker people. We propose two distinct methods for calculating welfare effects: the first, less structural approach yields a lower bound on the benefits and progressivity of Medicare; the second, more structural approach yields both upper and lower bounds that are also likely to be tighter. Finally, our data can be used to evaluate the welfare impact of past policy changes-- such as the repeal of the Medicare earnings cap--and proposed policy changes--such as a Medicare prescription drug benefit, changes in the age of Medicare eligibility, or Medicare ""buy-in"" proposals.         ",WHOM DOES MEDICARE BENEFIT,6771400,R01AG021940,"['aging ', ' tobacco abuse ', ' health economics ', ' health care cost /financing ', ' medical indigency ', ' health insurance ', ' Medicare /Medicaid ', ' human mortality ', ' academic achievement ', ' American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' socioeconomics ', ' human data ', ' health care policy ', ' smoking ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2004,232015,0.07286507199152681
"Medicare + Choice a nd Minority Elderly  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medicare is specifically mandated to provide health care services to elderly and/or disabled United States residents, as well as those with end stage renal disease. Although Medicare has been successful in dramatically improving both the access to care and the overall health of its constituents, studies have shown inequalities in care associated with the race/ethnicity of Medicare beneficiaries. On the surface, Medicare health maintenance organizations (HMOs) appear to address some of the factors associated with these inequalities, however, the Medicare HMO program, now called Medicare+Choice (M+C), is itself undergoing substantial program changes as a result of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) and subsequent revisions, e.g., the Balanced Budget Revision Act (BBRA) and the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA). This study has two broad objectives. First, we will determine individual level characteristics related to M+C plan enrollment among elderly White, Black, and Hispanic Medicare beneficiaries, whether the factors which elderly Black and Hispanic beneficiaries report as influencing their enrollment in HMOs differ from those that influence elderly White Medicare beneficiaries, and whether elderly Black and Hispanic beneficiaries enrolled in HMOs differ from HMO enrolled elderly White beneficiaries in terms of their self-reported health, use of health care, and perceived access to care. Second, we will examine the availability of Medicare HMOs and benefit packages for beneficiaries of differing race/ethnic classifications, how HMO enrollment rates are related to race/ethnic classification and range of plan benefits, and how the availability of HMOs and HMO enrollment by different race/ethnic groups changed subsequent to implementation of BBA provisions. We will use both survey and population-based (using Medicare administrative data and other population-based data) methodologies to examine individual and system level factors affecting access to and use of medical care, the availability of plans and services, and plan selection by enrollees. This study will provide the first comprehensive examination of both individual and system level factors affecting minority use of the Medicare HMOs, and will provide needed information on how the evolving Medicare system is affecting health care for Black and Hispanic Medicare beneficiaries.

"In-Depth Examination of Disparities in Cancer Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed research uses 1996 through 2000 Medicare and Medicaid eligibility and claim files for Michigan residents linked with the Michigan Cancer and Death Certificate Registries to create an inception cohort of newly diagnosed cancer patients. This cohort will be identified by Medicaid eligibility status (dually eligible versus Medicare only). We propose to examine disparities in the incidence of breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer, the stage of these diseases at diagnosis, treatment afforded to patients and associated costs of care, and the survival time following diagnosis. This research seeks to expand knowledge regarding the complex interactions among the social, personal, racial, and health system variables that create and influence disparities along the cancer trajectory. We test a systematically derived set of hypotheses and seek to determine how disparities identified early in the trajectory influence disparities at later points in the trajectory. For example, does later stage at diagnosis lead to less appropriate care that leads to higher costs and shorter survival? An examination of the impact of disparities in cancer detection and/or treatment on survival is one of the significant additions of this research to the state of the science.

"Effects of Managed Care Growth on Charity Care:    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The candidate's most general career goal is to independently conduct high quality research that will leverage improvements in access to health services.  A related career goal is to advance theoretical understanding of transformations of public health and medical systems and how these changes affect access to services by vulnerable populations.  His proposed research agenda and training program have been fashioned to catalyze development of research skills needed to meet his research and career goals.  The proposed research agenda is to study several mechanisms through which increases in managed care may have affected provision of care for the uninsured by local health departments (LHDs) and physicians.  The candidate will examine the extent to which increases in managed care have: a) diverted Medicaid revenues away from LHDs, reducing their cross-subsidization and provision of care for the uninsured; and b) decreased the Medicaid revenue and overall revenue of physicians, leading to a decrease in their provision of charity care.  He also will examine the extent to which increases in managed care have: a) decreased physicians' autonomy (indicated by decreased ownership, decreased perceived clinical freedom, and increased size of practice), leading to decreased charity care; and b) increased discontinuation and privatization of LHD services resulting in a decrease in LHDs' ability to assure access of the uninsured.  This research will aid development of strategies for improving access to health services among the uninsured.  The analyses will require that the candidate learn new techniques of statistical analyses and application of theories from the fields of health economics and the sociology of health institutions and professions.  Through courses and regular interaction with a statistical mentor, he will acquire new statistical analytical skills.  To analyze and interpret physician responses to organizational and financial incentives and constraints on the provision of charity care, the candidate will study the theoretical and empirical literature on physician agency, including physician motives and power under the complex conditions accompanying increased HMO and Medicaid managed care penetration.

"Cost-Related Underuse of Medications in the Elderly    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since Medicare was enacted in 1965, the program has excluded coverage for outpatient prescription medications except for injection drugs furnished by a physician. It is now widely recognized that the elderly face an erosion of prescription benefits as insurers respond to mounting fiscal pressures with a variety of cost-cutting and cost-shifting measures. Medicare beneficiaries must rely on a range of supplemental sources to help with drug expenses. The Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), administered annually to a representative national sample of elderly and disabled adults enrolled in Medicare, represents the gold standard for information on rates and sources of prescription coverage among elderly Americans. However the MCBS provides little information on cost-related non-compliance with medication regimens, and there are no other national data sources. While preliminary research documents the relationships among out-of-pocket medication costs, rates of non-compliance, and adverse clinical outcomes, no national study to date has addressed whether such cost-related barriers lead to under use of essential drugs for chronic illnesses, substitution of over-the-counter or alternative medicines, or reductions in physician visits. This project will establish a permanent, ongoing national data resource that permits policymakers and researchers to measure, monitor, and identify changes in cost-related under use of medications (CRUM) among elderly Medicare beneficiaries. We will develop new, comprehensive measures of CRUM; validate the measures in a survey of approximately 200 elderly enrollees in a large health plan; integrate the measures in the MCBS for annual surveys of approximately 15,000 non-institutionalized elderly Medicare enrollees (the cost of which will be borne by the US Department of Health and Human Services, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services); and analyze MCBS data to identify the extent to which CRUM is associated with patient socio-demographics, health status and medical conditions, source of prescription coverage, and out-of-pocket prescription costs.         ",Cost-Related Underuse of Medications in the Elderly,6901898,R01AG022362,"['human old age (65+) ', ' chronic disease /disorder ', ' drug quality /standard ', ' drug /agent ', ' chemotherapy ', ' health care quality ', ' health care cost /financing ', ' Medicare /Medicaid ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' health behavior ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' therapy compliance ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIA,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R01,2005,333904,0.0781241416994381
"WHOM DOES MEDICARE BENEFIT    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid growth in Medicare claims payments has transferred resources away from younger cohorts to elderly cohorts. Less clear, however, is the way in which Medicare redistributes resources within cohorts. While disadvantaged groups pay fewer Medicare taxes, they also tend to die earlier and receive fewer Medicare benefits. We propose to use several new data sources to investigate whether Medicare redistributes resources towards disadvantaged groups within a cohort, and whether it improves the welfare of any or all these groups.  We will compare less educated people to the more educated, non-whites to whites, and smokers to nonsmokers.  Our calculations will be based primarily on individual-level data on Medicare benefits from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, and on individual-level longitudinal data on lifetime Medicare taxes paid from the Health and Retirement Study's Earnings History Files. Our approach differs from previous research in its use of individual-level data, which--unlike the previous studies of geographically aggregated Medicare claims data--seem to reveal an extremely high degree of progressivity in Medicare. Our data suggests that disadvantaged people--who are sicker--receive more Medicare benefits, even though average Medicare claims are higher in richer areas. As a result, the cash value of Medicare seems to be higher for poorer groups. We propose at least two reasons for this result: health care price levels are higher in richer areas, so that geographic variation in health care expenditures can be misleading; in addition, richer areas will tend to have better health care facilities and will thus attract sicker people. We propose two distinct methods for calculating welfare effects: the first, less structural approach yields a lower bound on the benefits and progressivity of Medicare; the second, more structural approach yields both upper and lower bounds that are also likely to be tighter. Finally, our data can be used to evaluate the welfare impact of past policy changes-- such as the repeal of the Medicare earnings cap--and proposed policy changes--such as a Medicare prescription drug benefit, changes in the age of Medicare eligibility, or Medicare ""buy-in"" proposals.         ",WHOM DOES MEDICARE BENEFIT,6936456,R01AG021940,"['aging ', ' tobacco abuse ', ' health economics ', ' health care cost /financing ', ' medical indigency ', ' health insurance ', ' Medicare /Medicaid ', ' human mortality ', ' academic achievement ', ' American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' socioeconomics ', ' human data ', ' health care policy ', ' smoking ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' medically underserved population ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2005,240646,0.07286507199152681
"Effects of Managed Care Growth on Charity Care:    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The candidate's most general career goal is to independently conduct high quality research that will leverage improvements in access to health services.

His proposed research agenda and training program have been fashioned to catalyze development of research skills needed to meet his research and career goals.  The proposed research agenda is to study several mechanisms through which increases in managed care may have affected provision of care for the uninsured by local health departments (LHDs) and physicians.  The candidate will examine the extent to which increases in managed care have: a) diverted Medicaid revenues away from LHDs, reducing their cross-subsidization and provision of care for the uninsured; and b) decreased the Medicaid revenue and overall revenue of physicians, leading to a decrease in their provision of charity care.  He also will examine the extent to which increases in managed care have: a) decreased physicians' autonomy (indicated by decreased ownership, decreased perceived clinical freedom, and increased size of practice), leading to decreased charity care; and b) increased discontinuation and privatization of LHD services resulting in a decrease in LHDs' ability to assure access of the uninsured.  This research will aid development of strategies for improving access to health services among the uninsured.

"In-Depth Examination of Disparities in Cancer Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed research uses 1996 through 2000 Medicare and Medicaid eligibility and claim files for Michigan residents linked with the Michigan Cancer and Death Certificate Registries to create an inception cohort of newly diagnosed cancer patients. This cohort will be identified by Medicaid eligibility status (dually eligible versus Medicare only). We propose to examine disparities in the incidence of breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer, the stage of these diseases at diagnosis, treatment afforded to patients and associated costs of care, and the survival time following diagnosis. This research seeks to expand knowledge regarding the complex interactions among the social, personal, racial, and health system variables that create and influence disparities along the cancer trajectory. We test a systematically derived set of hypotheses and seek to determine how disparities identified early in the trajectory influence disparities at later points in the trajectory. For example, does later stage at diagnosis lead to less appropriate care that leads to higher costs and shorter survival? An examination of the impact of disparities in cancer detection and/or treatment on survival is one of the significant additions of this research to the state of the science. We have four simply stated aims that are analytically highly complex. Our aims are targeted at two populations of interest--persons dually eligible for Medicare and full Medicaid benefits and persons eligible for Medicare without Medicaid (for the purposes of this application, referred to as ""Medicare only."")

"Major Mental Disorders and HIV -- Health Services Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasingly, policy and programmatic responses to the HIV epidemic in the United States are challenged by complex patterns of comorbidity between major mental illness (MMI) and HIV disease. During the current grant period, we have developed and validated a range of methods that use New Jersey Medicaid data to address these issues, and have applied them to provide vitally important information on this relationship. In the continuation period, we will build on this initial work to develop and utilize recent data from five states (CA, FL, NJ, NY, and TX), from both Medicaid and Medicare. Analyses will provide a much more comprehensive understanding of HIV-MMI co-occurrence in time and space; on issues of quality and cost of care; on the complex interrelationships between treatment for psychiatric problems and HIV disease in this population; and on the role and impact of Medicaid and Medicare in this care at a time of many changes in these programs. Guided by a conceptual framework articulating hypothesized relationships among clinical and demographic characteristics, community resources, comorbidities and a range of outcomes, analyses will address evolving patterns of diagnosed comorbidity; patterns of treatment of MMI for the dually diagnosed as compared with those with HIV only and MMI only; and the impact of MMI and of treatment of comorbid mental disorders on HIV treatment and outcomes, including consistent use of antiretroviral medications, and use of hospitalization and other acute and long-term care services. We will analyze racial/ethnic and other socioeconomic disparities in care for persons with HIV, MMI or both, and identify intervening variables and targets for intervention. We will also examine variations in cost of care for beneficiaries living with HIV in relation to mental health comorbidity, with comparisons to cost of care for mentally ill individuals without HIV, and examine the role of Medicaid and Medicare for dually eligible individuals with these conditions. Results will provide knowledge that is useful at multiple levels. They will provide important information on the challenges of comorbid mental illness and HIV, and provide methodological tools for appropriate use of administrative data, and for modeling longitudinal services use and outcomes, that will be of general utility for mental health services research.         ",Major Mental Disorders and HIV -- Health Services Use,7064140,R01MH058984,"['sexually transmitted disease ', ' extended care ', ' emergency care ', ' hospital patient care ', ' health care service evaluation ', ' health care service utilization ', ' health care cost /financing ', ' Medicare /Medicaid ', ' AIDS /HIV diagnosis ', ' AIDS therapy ', ' HIV infection ', ' antiAIDS agent ', ' mental health service ', ' mental disorder ', ' mental disorder chemotherapy ', ' mental disorder diagnosis ', ' psychotropic drug ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' socioeconomics ', ' substance abuse related disorder ', ' human data ', ' comorbidity ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMH,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2006,500500,0.08691040881249218
"Cancer-Related Disparities in the Elderly Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although cancer is the second leading cause of death in the elderly population, there is evidence that older Americans are less likely to be diagnosed at early stages of cancer, or to receive potentially curative treatment for early stages of cancer.  The disparities are especially pronounced for members of lower socioeconomic groups.  Despite the nearly universal Medicare coverage, the out-of-pocket expenses may present significant financial burden to elderly individuals with limited resources, which implies a greater likelihood to delay or not to seek preventive, routine, or screening services.  With respect to cancer-related outcomes, this translates into advanced stages of cancer upon diagnosis, and sub-optimal treatment and follow-up care, therefore poor prognosis.  The proposed studies will compare cancer-related outcomes (stage at diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care) among individuals >= 65 years of age diagnosed with breast, prostate, or colon cancer during the study period, 1998-2002.  Comparisons will be aimed at identifying disparities by age, race, comorbidities, socioeconomic status, and Medicaid status.  The study will link the Ohio Cancer Incidence Surveillance System (OCISS) with Medicare and Medicaid files, in order to identify Medicare-only, and dually eligible Medicare-Medicaid eligible individuals.  Data from the U.S. Census will be used to derive measures of socioeconomic status in the Medicare-only population.  The research plan outlined in this proposal will be complemented by a detailed training plan to enhance the Candidate's skills in relation to measuring cancer disparities, and in analyzing the findings in the context of health care policy relevant to cancer prevention and control.      The research, training, and education plan is uniquely designed to advance the Candidate's career, the  principal goal of which is to become an independent investigator specializing in the converging areas of  cancer disparities and health care policy and financing.  The commitment of the Department to study cancer-related outcomes; the mentorship to be received by the outstanding individuals designated as Mentor, Co-Mentors and Consultants; as well as the training plan outlined in this proposal, will provide the optimal resources for the Candidate to achieve her career goals.

"Impact of Medicare on Utilization and Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Medicare program provides nearly universal health insurance coverage for the elderly.

Analyses will provide a much more comprehensive understanding of HIV-MMI co-occurrence in time and space; on issues of quality and cost of care; on the complex interrelationships between treatment for psychiatric problems and HIV disease in this population; and on the role and impact of Medicaid and Medicare in this care at a time of many changes in these programs. Guided by a conceptual framework articulating hypothesized relationships among clinical and demographic characteristics, community resources, comorbidities and a range of outcomes, analyses will address evolving patterns of diagnosed comorbidity; patterns of treatment of MMI for the dually diagnosed as compared with those with HIV only and MMI only; and the impact of MMI and of treatment of comorbid mental disorders on HIV treatment and outcomes, including consistent use of antiretroviral medications, and use of hospitalization and other acute and long-term care services. We will analyze racial/ethnic and other socioeconomic disparities in care for persons with HIV, MMI or both, and identify intervening variables and targets for intervention. We will also examine variations in cost of care for beneficiaries living with HIV in relation to mental health comorbidity, with comparisons to cost of care for mentally ill individuals without HIV, and examine the role of Medicaid and Medicare for dually eligible individuals with these conditions. Results will provide knowledge that is useful at multiple levels. They will provide important information on the challenges of comorbid mental illness and HIV, and provide methodological tools for appropriate use of administrative data, and for modeling longitudinal services use and outcomes, that will be of general utility for mental health services research.         ",Major Mental Disorders and HIV -- Health Services Use,7174646,R01MH058984,"['Acquired

"Cancer-Related Disparities in the Elderly Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although cancer is the second leading cause of death in the elderly population, there is evidence that older Americans are less likely to be diagnosed at early stages of cancer, or to receive potentially curative treatment for early stages of cancer.  The disparities are especially pronounced for members of lower socioeconomic groups.  Despite the nearly universal Medicare coverage, the out-of-pocket expenses may present significant financial burden to elderly individuals with limited resources, which implies a greater likelihood to delay or not to seek preventive, routine, or screening services.  With respect to cancer-related outcomes, this translates into advanced stages of cancer upon diagnosis, and sub-optimal treatment and follow-up care, therefore poor prognosis.  The proposed studies will compare cancer-related outcomes (stage at diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care) among individuals >= 65 years of age diagnosed with breast, prostate, or colon cancer during the study period, 1998-2002.  Comparisons will be aimed at identifying disparities by age, race, comorbidities, socioeconomic status, and Medicaid status.  The study will link the Ohio Cancer Incidence Surveillance System (OCISS) with Medicare and Medicaid files, in order to identify Medicare-only, and dually eligible Medicare-Medicaid eligible individuals.  Data from the U.S. Census will be used to derive measures of socioeconomic status in the Medicare-only population.  The research plan outlined in this proposal will be complemented by a detailed training plan to enhance the Candidate's skills in relation to measuring cancer disparities, and in analyzing the findings in the context of health care policy relevant to cancer prevention and control.      The research, training, and education plan is uniquely designed to advance the Candidate's career, the  principal goal of which is to become an independent investigator specializing in the converging areas of  cancer disparities and health care policy and financing.  The commitment of the Department to study cancer-related outcomes; the mentorship to be received by the outstanding individuals designated as Mentor, Co-Mentors and Consultants; as well as the training plan outlined in this proposal, will provide the optimal resources for the Candidate to achieve her career goals.

"Impact of Medicare on Utilization and Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Medicare program provides nearly universal health insurance coverage for the elderly. The onset of Medicare eligibility is associated with a drop in inter-group disparities in access to ambulatory care and a rise in hospital admission rates. Surprisingly, however, African Americans experience much smaller increases than whites in rates of hospitalization at age 65, and in rates for specific procedures including hip and knee replacements. Thus, Medicare appears to have an ambiguous effect on disparities in healthcare use. We propose a series of projects to study the changes in health care utilization and health that occur as individuals reach the age of Medicare eligibility, and analyze the effects of these changes on the extent of racial and ethnic disparities in health utilization and health. Specifically, we propose to: 1. Analyze the changes in rates of inpatient admissions and outpatient procedures occurring at age 65 for Hispanics, blacks, and whites across major health conditions, and document how the relative changes across groups vary with the nature of the condition and with the characteristics of patients, providers, and institutions. 2. Estimate whether the intensity of hospital treatment varies with eligibility for Medicare, whether these differences affect mortality, and whether the changes in intensity of treatment are different for different ethnic/racial groups. 3. Use panel data sets to estimate the impacts of reaching age 65 on alternative measures of health, physical functioning, and quality of life for Hispanics, blacks and whites. 4. Examine differences across groups in the utilization of health care services in the first few years of Medicare coverage, and test alternative explanations for these differences, including the role of supplemental insurance coverage.              ",Impact of Medicare on Utilization and Health Disparities,7432492,R01AG026290,"['Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Expenditure ', ' Florida ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Depth ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Incentives ', ' inducement ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ', ' MRSI ', ' MR Spectroscopy ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Records ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Nature ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Retirement ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Attention ', ' Work ', ' Physical Function ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' hospital admission rate ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' Total Arthroplasty of the Knee ', ' TKR - Total knee replacement ', ' Prosthetic total arthroplasty of the knee ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Drops ', ' ']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,R01,2008,266888,0.09498954177531903
"Cancer Care Delivery in Medicaid    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Shortcomings in cancer care disproportionately affect minority group members and contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in cancer mortality. Many of the nearly 15 million US adults insured by Medicaid are Black or Hispanic and therefore, evaluating cancer care delivery in the context of these state health insurance programs is a logical strategy to identify the sources of disparities. By merging Medicaid enrollment and claims files with tumor registry data from New York and California, 2 states with large ethnically diverse populations and many Medicaid enrollees, we seek to identify how access to safety net health insurance and race/ethnicity intersect with common cancer diagnoses. The overarching questions we will address are: Where are there opportunities for decreasing the cancer burden for the poor? Does cancer care delivery in Medicaid achieve reasonable quality benchmarks? Do racial disparities in treatment persist within Medicaid? Specifically, we will evaluate aspects of care we understand well based on our team's prior work using Medicare-registry linked data: 1) Stage distribution at diagnosis, a marker for cancer severity and access to medical care; 2) Cancer surgery and the receipt of complex operations at experienced hospitals with high procedure volume; and, 3) Adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy treatments for cancers where these interventions improve outcomes. Analyses will focus on common solid tumors among two groups of Medicaid enrollees: adults aged 21-64 and the elderly aged 65+ dually enrolled in Medicare. We will evaluate care patterns for Medicaid patients and where data permit, compare them to patterns for otherwise similar persons not covered by Medicaid. Specifically, for each important aspect of cancer care we will also measure racial/ethnic disparities within the Medicaid program and test our hypothesis that they are minimized for patients with long term enrollment prior to diagnosis. More generally, this project will construct a resource for health services researchers, characterize its yield, and use it to identify and prioritize specific opportunities to improve cancer care delivery for vulnerable Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer care is not as good as it should be for all Americans. It is well known that care is sub-optimal for persons who are poor, many of whom are insured by State Medicaid programs. This study asks the question, is cancer care as good as it should be for patients who receive their health insurance from state Medicaid programs? Do patients who have long term access to Medicaid present with more advanced stage disease? Do they receive necessary treatments? Do the gaps in care on the basis of race and ethnicity exist within the Medicaid program? Is the information recorded on Medicaid claims reliable enough to identify important aspects of cancer treatment like surgery, radiation and chemotherapy? Could linkage of Medicaid enrollment and/or claims data to cancer registry data provide a framework for ongoing monitoring of quality of care? By examining data from New York and California which have large multiethnic populations and many persons living in poverty, this study will answer these questions and identify opportunities to improve cancer care delivery to poor Americans.                   ",Cancer Care Delivery in Medicaid,7526764,R01CA131847,"['Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Caliber ', ' Diameter ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Sum ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Monitor ', ' Rate ', ' Esophageal ', ' Adjuvant ', ' beneficiary ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hospitals ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Medicaid ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' New York ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Poverty ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Registries ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' cohort ', ' Breast ', ' California ', ' member ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Genus Cola ', ' Cola ', ' Metric ', ' social ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Cervix ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' cancer registry ', ' Radiation ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiosurgery ', ' Stereotaxic Radiosurgery ', ' Stereotactic Radiosurgery ', ' Stereotactic External Beam Irradiation ', ' Radiation Surgery ', ' Adjuvant Chemotherapy ', ' Adjuvant Drug Therapy ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' cancer surgery ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Colon ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' safety net ', ' chemotherapy ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' tumor ', ' ']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2008,473906,0.15098416068523404
"Outcomes of Curable Cancers in Vulnerable Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of cancers, including cancer of the testis; Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphoma; early- stage breast, colorectal, lung, and urinary bladder cancer; early-stage melanoma; and pediatric malignancies in adults are considered ""curable"", which we define as 5-year survival without relapse. While high rates of cure have been reported in the population at large, little is known about whether these rates compare uniformly across subgroups of the population; and if so, which factors contribute to lower cure rates. In the proposed studies, which focus on adults 20-50 years of age, we aim to assess survival from these cancers in the population of Ohio overall, and in the Medicaid population in particular. Medicaid beneficiaries constitute a disadvantaged subgroup of the population. This is because in addition to socioeconomic vulnerabilities, adult beneficiaries suffer from disabling physical and/or mental ailments. An exception to this is low-income women of childbearing age seeking Medicaid coverage for maternity care. In studies accounting for the entire population in the state of Ohio, we will examine variations in survival by demographic attributes, as well as Medicaid status, additional socioeconomic indicators, and county of residence. When focusing on Medicaid beneficiaries, and given the availability of claims data for that population, we will examine the likelihood of cure in the presence or absence of mental and/or physical comorbid conditions. The proposed studies will use a unique population-based database, which we will develop by linking records from the Ohio Cancer Incidence Surveillance System (OCISS), with the state Medicaid enrollment and claims files, and data from the U.S. Census. Death-related variables, available through the OCISS files, originate from the National Death Index. By identifying differentials in survival and cure rates across subgroups of the population, these studies will provide a foundation for future research endeavors aimed at identifying the specific factors contributing to such disparities. In addition, because these cancers have been rarely examined in the context of health services and disparities-related research, the proposed studies will provide an opportunity to assess methodological issues and potential difficulties in carrying out comparable studies at a larger scale and in other settings.

The proposed studies aim to determine whether favorable outcomes of curable cancers are observed uniformly across subgroups of the population in Ohio.

"Outcomes of Curable Cancers in Vulnerable Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of cancers, including cancer of the testis; Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphoma; early- stage breast, colorectal, lung, and urinary bladder cancer; early-stage melanoma; and pediatric malignancies in adults are considered ""curable"", which we define as 5-year survival without relapse. While high rates of cure have been reported in the population at large, little is known about whether these rates compare uniformly across subgroups of the population; and if so, which factors contribute to lower cure rates. In the proposed studies, which focus on adults 20-50 years of age, we aim to assess survival from these cancers in the population of Ohio overall, and in the Medicaid population in particular. Medicaid beneficiaries constitute a disadvantaged subgroup of the population. This is because in addition to socioeconomic vulnerabilities, adult beneficiaries suffer from disabling physical and/or mental ailments. An exception to this is low-income women of childbearing age seeking Medicaid coverage for maternity care. In studies accounting for the entire population in the state of Ohio, we will examine variations in survival by demographic attributes, as well as Medicaid status, additional socioeconomic indicators, and county of residence. When focusing on Medicaid beneficiaries, and given the availability of claims data for that population, we will examine the likelihood of cure in the presence or absence of mental and/or physical comorbid conditions. The proposed studies will use a unique population-based database, which we will develop by linking records from the Ohio Cancer Incidence Surveillance System (OCISS), with the state Medicaid enrollment and claims files, and data from the U.S. Census. Death-related variables, available through the OCISS files, originate from the National Death Index. By identifying differentials in survival and cure rates across subgroups of the population, these studies will provide a foundation for future research endeavors aimed at identifying the specific factors contributing to such disparities. In addition, because these cancers have been rarely examined in the context of health services and disparities-related research, the proposed studies will provide an opportunity to assess methodological issues and potential difficulties in carrying out comparable studies at a larger scale and in other settings.

"Estimating the Demand for Medicaid Financial Long-Term Care for the Elderly    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for a K01 award is to facilitate Dr. Arpita Chattopadhyay's transition to an independent investigator in the field of epidemiology of aging and long-term care with a focus on Medicaid policy. Her long-term goal is to develop an interdisciplinary program linking biomedical research on aging and disability with behavioral research in economics and sociology that focuses on utilization and financing of long-term care among the elderly. The training goals are (1) to acquire substantive knowledge in sociology and economics of aging and long-term care policies; (2) to acquire new skills in developing stochastic models of disability; and (3) to develop a frame work for estimating the determinants of disability, long-term care use, and financing. The mentoring team includes Dr. Andrew Bindman, an experienced health services researcher; Drs. Robert Newcomer and Charlene Harrington, experts in long-term care issues; Dr. Peter Bacchetti, expert in stochastic processes in chronic disease modeling; and Dr. Ronal Lee, who specializes in the demography of aging   The impact of changing racial and ethnic composition on the demand for long-term care and utilization of Medicaid for financing long-term care has not been studied. This research will overcome this shortcoming by incorporating race and ethnicity into projection models for long-term care demand and Medicaid use among the elderly. The research will address two of the priority areas at the NIA, namely aging and health /healthcare disparities and efficiency of the health system. Drawing upon data from sample surveys and administrative sources on service use, this research proposes four specific aims that correspond to four structural determinants of future long-term care use and financing. Aim 1 will determine racial and ethnic differences in age-specific prevalence of disability. Aim 2 will determine racial and ethnic differences in age specific use of long-term care for a given level of disability. Aim 3 will determine the racial and ethnic differences in use of Medicaid among the disabled elderly. Aims 1-3 will then be combined and used to obtain stochastic projection of elderly Medicaid beneficiaries in long-term care (Aim 4). A detailed microsimulation model incorporating behavioral and structural determinants of using Medicaid financed longterm care will be proposed for an R01 project at the end of the K01.    This research will enhance our understanding of long-term care needs of the elderly racial and ethnic minority population and will aid in planning service delivery for long-term care for the poor and vulnerable disabled elderly who rely on Medicaid in an effective and efficient manner.          ",Estimating the Demand for Medicaid Financial Long-Term Care for the Elderly,7660654,K01AG031304,"['Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' community based service ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Demography ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Health system ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Long-Term Care for Elderly ', ' sex ', ' beneficiary ', ' Behavioral ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Sociology ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Stochastic Processes ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' California ', ' skills ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' assistive living ', ' assisted living ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2009,118691,0.06254881053303483
"Incidence and Outcomes of Ectopic Pregnancy in the Medicaid Population    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am a family physician with a background of academic excellence, a solid introduction to health services research, and a demonstrated commitment to the well-being of disadvantaged women and children. Goals: In the long term, I aim to help improve reproductive health outcomes and eliminate disparities in maternal and child health. My five-year goal is to identify ectopic pregnancy incidence and outcomes in the Medicaid population and in the process to develop a new, widely-applicable methodology for studying ectopic pregnancy epidemiology. Career Development Plan: In order to accomplish these goals, I need to acquire the knowledge and skills to manage and analyze large administrative data sets. I will do so by taking formal courses in quantitative research methods and health policy, participating in workshops on the use of public insurance data, meeting regularly with mentors and advisors, and presenting my work internally and at national meetings for review. Research Plan: I will conduct secondary analysis of Medicaid Analytic Extract files, measuring ectopic pregnancy incidence, rate, and outcomes. I will then develop a multivariate model to explain individual and state-based variation in ectopic pregnancy. Research Environment: I am supported by a primary mentor with long-standing experience developing junior investigators; a diverse mentorship team of physicians and population scientists with relevant content and methodology expertise; an advisory board of national experts in maternal health epidemiology, Medicaid policy, and health econometrics; and an institution with proven dedication to research excellence.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ectopic pregnancy is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality.

"Oral Health Disparities Among Medicaid Beneficiaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is very limited information on the burden of oral and pharyngeal cancers for specials needs populations, including the frail elderly, the disabled, and those with AIDS/HIV. In addition, significant racial disparities exist, as black males have a much lower 5-year survival rate compared with white males. Medicaid is an important source of insurance coverage for low-income racial and ethnic minorities, and also for the special needs populations. Medicaid administrative data linked with cancer registry data can provide a powerful data source to understand health disparities among these subgroups. This study will analyze 1999 through 2004 Medicaid administrative data and statewide all-payer discharge data (to identify comparison groups, including those insured by private payers and Medicare) linked with cancer registry databases to address three specific objectives: (1) assess the ability to study the special needs population and comparison cohorts with oral and pharyngeal cancers in the linked databases; (2) generate descriptive statistics on the incidence of cancer, stage at diagnosis, and cancer mortality among priority populations (based on findings from the data quality assessment performed under objective 1) and compare with other populations; and (3) assess the utility of the linked database to study treatment patterns among priority populations. Data from the states of Georgia, Illinois, South Carolina, and Texas were selected based on specific selection criteria, including large Medicaid fee-for-serve populations and a high burden of oral and pharyngeal cancers. To address objective 1, we will assess the quality of linkage between Medicaid claims and the statewide discharge data with the cancer registry data, the ability to identify specific subgroups, and availability of adequate sample sizes to perform assessments. For objective 2, we will produce unadjusted and age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates. We will also generate the annual percentage change and perform joinpoint regression analysis to identify points where a significant change in the linear slope of the trend occurs. For objective 3, we will assess the number of months of continuous enrollment available in Medicaid, evaluate the percentage of claims with missing values, and assess the ability to identify relevant procedures and treatments using ICD-9 and CPT-4 codes. If this proposed study shows that claims data are of adequate quality to systematically study oral cancer treatments and address health disparities, a follow-on application will be submitted to perform comparative assessments of treatment patterns using cancer registry data linked with Medicaid, Medicare, and private payer claims data.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medicaid is an important source of insurance coverage for low-income racial and ethnic minorities, as well as special needs populations, including the frail elderly, the disabled, and those with HIV/AIDS. Medicaid administrative data linked with cancer registry data can provide a powerful data source to understand health disparities among these subgroups.

"Impact of Medicare Part D on Cancer and Diabetes Disparities among Dual Enrollees    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Impact of Medicare Part D on Cancer and Diabetes Disparities among Dual Enrollees Despite the availability of effective therapies to treat chronic disease, disparities in the use of these medicines persist. Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented among the more than 7 million dual Medicaid and Medicare enrollees, who were transitioned from Medicaid to Medicare Part D drug coverage plans on January 1, 2006. Concerns have been raised about the random assignment of dual enrollees to Part D plans, due to varying benefits and reported declines in coverage. Few studies have examined the impact of coverage policy on disparities in medication use and related health outcomes. The implementation of Medicare Part D offers a unique opportunity to investigate the consequences of a major change in national coverage policy on health disparities. Our application focuses on two principal mechanisms by which Medicare Part D may impact health disparities among dual enrollees: 1) the removal of limits on the number of reimbursable prescriptions per month and 2) randomization of enrollees to plans with varying availability of medications for chronic disease management. The removal of prescription drug limits in some states may reduce gaps in medication use and, for high risk subgroups, access-related disparities in outcomes. For dual enrollees in all states, the ability to navigate Part D related changes in benefits (i.e., medication accessibility) may be mediated through patient (e.g., English language proficiency, education, usual source of care) and care setting characteristics that interact with race and ethnicity. Taking advantage of the random assignment of dual enrollees to Part D plans, we will use a strong quasi-experimental and an experimental design to investigate the impact of Medicare Part D drug coverage on racial and ethnic disparities among dual enrollees overall and among high risk chronically ill subgroups. Because of variation in Medicaid and in Part D plan benefits, each state represents a separate natural policy experiment. The goal of this study is to move beyond the documentation of health disparities to understanding the impact of coverage policy on disparities and potential mediating factors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Impact of Medicare Part D on Cancer and Diabetes Disparities among Dual Enrollees Access to appropriate health care services is a key driver of differences in health services use and outcomes by race and ethnicity. However, few studies have evaluated the impact of changes in public insurance programs (e.g., Medicaid, Medicare) on health disparities. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of a major change in national health insurance coverage (the passage of Medicare Part D) on disparities in health services use, outcomes and costs among vulnerable chronically ill patients.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Impact of Medicare Part D on Cancer and Diabetes Disparities among Dual Enrollees  Access to appropriate health care services is a key driver of differences in health services use and outcomes by race and ethnicity.

"Cancer Care Delivery in Medicaid    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Shortcomings in cancer care disproportionately affect minority group members and contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in cancer mortality. Many of the nearly 15 million US adults insured by Medicaid are Black or Hispanic and therefore, evaluating cancer care delivery in the context of these state health insurance programs is a logical strategy to identify the sources of disparities. By merging Medicaid enrollment and claims files with tumor registry data from New York and California, 2 states with large ethnically diverse populations and many Medicaid enrollees, we seek to identify how access to safety net health insurance and race/ethnicity intersect with common cancer diagnoses. The overarching questions we will address are: Where are there opportunities for decreasing the cancer burden for the poor? Does cancer care delivery in Medicaid achieve reasonable quality benchmarks? Do racial disparities in treatment persist within Medicaid? Specifically, we will evaluate aspects of care we understand well based on our team's prior work using Medicare-registry linked data: 1) Stage distribution at diagnosis, a marker for cancer severity and access to medical care; 2) Cancer surgery and the receipt of complex operations at experienced hospitals with high procedure volume; and, 3) Adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy treatments for cancers where these interventions improve outcomes. Analyses will focus on common solid tumors among two groups of Medicaid enrollees: adults aged 21-64 and the elderly aged 65+ dually enrolled in Medicare. We will evaluate care patterns for Medicaid patients and where data permit, compare them to patterns for otherwise similar persons not covered by Medicaid. Specifically, for each important aspect of cancer care we will also measure racial/ethnic disparities within the Medicaid program and test our hypothesis that they are minimized for patients with long term enrollment prior to diagnosis. More generally, this project will construct a resource for health services researchers, characterize its yield, and use it to identify and prioritize specific opportunities to improve cancer care delivery for vulnerable Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer care is not as good as it should be for all Americans. It is well known that care is sub-optimal for persons who are poor, many of whom are insured by State Medicaid programs. This study asks the question, is cancer care as good as it should be for patients who receive their health insurance from state Medicaid programs? Do patients who have long term access to Medicaid present with more advanced stage disease? Do they receive necessary treatments? Do the gaps in care on the basis of race and ethnicity exist within the Medicaid program? Is the information recorded on Medicaid claims reliable enough to identify important aspects of cancer treatment like surgery, radiation and chemotherapy? Could linkage of Medicaid enrollment and/or claims data to cancer registry data provide a framework for ongoing monitoring of quality of care? By examining data from New York and California which have large multiethnic populations and many persons living in poverty, this study will answer these questions and identify opportunities to improve cancer care delivery to poor Americans.                   ",Cancer Care Delivery in Medicaid,7667310,R01CA131847,"['Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' cancer surgery ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Colon ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' 21 year old ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' safety net ', ' chemotherapy ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Caliber ', ' Diameter ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Sum ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Monitor ', ' Esophageal ', ' Adjuvant ', ' beneficiary ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' tumor registry ', ' Hospitals ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Medicaid ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' New York ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Registries ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' cohort ', ' Breast ', ' California ', ' member ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Metric ', ' social ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Cervix ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' cancer registry ', ' Radiation ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiosurgery ', ' Stereotaxic Radiosurgery ', ' Stereotactic Radiosurgery ', ' Stereotactic External Beam Irradiation ', ' Radiation Surgery ', ' Adjuvant Chemotherapy ', ' Adjuvant Drug Therapy ', ' ']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2009,425077,0.15098416068523404
"Comparative Effectiveness of Health Insurance Reform on Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This application addresses broad Challenge Area (05) Comparative Effectiveness Research and specific Challenge Topic 05-MD-101*, Social Determinants of Health. We propose to conduct a comparative effectiveness analysis and cost effectiveness analysis to investigate the benefit of health insurance reform on addressing cancer health disparities. The social determinants of cancer health disparities have been described, which include access to quality health care, and insurance to pay for quality care. There is a need to investigate the comparative effectiveness of public health policies that improve access and quality of health care through improvements in health insurance as a mechanism to overcome social determinants of cancer health disparities. Specifically, we propose to investigate the comparative and cost effectiveness of health insurance reform that was instituted in 2006 in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, on the cancer outcomes of traditionally underserved women who have abnormal cervical and breast cancer screening studies. We propose to conduct this analysis using a unique database our research group has collected as part of the Boston University Patient Navigation Research Program. We have collected detailed clinical, demographic, insurance, and outcome data on over 3300 women, the entire cohort of women with abnormal breast and cervical cancer screening studies between 2004-5 and 2007-9 at 6 community health centers in Boston. Our proposed research is unique both in its approach and in the dataset to address the approach. We have collected data on a complete clinical cohort of women that health insurance reform specifically seeks to support. This dataset has the ability to observe the findings of the ""natural experiment"" of Massachusetts Health Insurance Reform, in that we began our data collection 2 years prior to insurance reform, and continued 2 years after its implementation. As many look to the Massachusetts experience to develop a national health insurance plan, our research has major impact potential on national policy. There is a critical need for empiric data on the clinical impact of health insurance reform. Our results will provide empirically derived comparative effectiveness data that is of critical interest to policy makers locally and nationally seeking to assess the benefits of insurance reform.

"Major Mental Disorders and HIV -- Health Services Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasingly, policy and programmatic responses to the HIV epidemic in the United States are challenged by complex patterns of comorbidity between major mental illness (MMI) and HIV disease. During the current grant period, we have developed and validated a range of methods that use New Jersey Medicaid data to address these issues, and have applied them to provide vitally important information on this relationship. In the continuation period, we will build on this initial work to develop and utilize recent data from five states (CA, FL, NJ, NY, and TX), from both Medicaid and Medicare. Analyses will provide a much more comprehensive understanding of HIV-MMI co-occurrence in time and space; on issues of quality and cost of care; on the complex interrelationships between treatment for psychiatric problems and HIV disease in this population; and on the role and impact of Medicaid and Medicare in this care at a time of many changes in these programs. Guided by a conceptual framework articulating hypothesized relationships among clinical and demographic characteristics, community resources, comorbidities and a range of outcomes, analyses will address evolving patterns of diagnosed comorbidity; patterns of treatment of MMI for the dually diagnosed as compared with those with HIV only and MMI only; and the impact of MMI and of treatment of comorbid mental disorders on HIV treatment and outcomes, including consistent use of antiretroviral medications, and use of hospitalization and other acute and long-term care services. We will analyze racial/ethnic and other socioeconomic disparities in care for persons with HIV, MMI or both, and identify intervening variables and targets for intervention. We will also examine variations in cost of care for beneficiaries living with HIV in relation to mental health comorbidity, with comparisons to cost of care for mentally ill individuals without HIV, and examine the role of Medicaid and Medicare for dually eligible individuals with these conditions. Results will provide knowledge that is useful at multiple levels. They will provide important information on the challenges of comorbid mental illness and HIV, and provide methodological tools for appropriate use of administrative data, and for modeling longitudinal services use and outcomes, that will be of general utility for mental health services research.         ",Major Mental Disorders and HIV -- Health Services Use,7559513,R01MH058984,"['Acquired

"Unevenness of physician Medicaid participation within communities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study analyzes unevenness in physician Medicaid participation (i.e., the extent to which Medicaid patients in a community are concentrated into the practices of a small number of physicians). The principal goal of the project is to answer the following question: Why is unevenness in physician Medicaid participation much greater in certain communities than in others? The specific aims of the project are: to measure the unevenness in physician Medicaid participation in various communities; to examine the association between unevenness in physician Medicaid participation and a variety of community characteristics (e.g., size and composition of the community population; racial segregation; state Medicaid policies); and to analyze how unevenness in physician Medicaid participation and other community-level characteristics affect the Medicaid participation decisions of individual physicians. The project will implement three methodological advancements over previous research: 1) the use of the Gini index to measure unevenness in Medicaid participation in various communities; 2) the use of hierarchical linear modeling techniques to analyze physician Medicaid participation decisions, thereby taking into account the inherently hierarchical set of factors influencing these decisions; and 3) the use of cross-level interactions in these models to examine why various groups of physicians respond differently to the community context in which they make Medicaid participation decisions. The findings of the study will be useful to researchers and policy analysts in both state and federal governments, who will benefit from a better understanding of how community-level characteristics foster unevenness in physician Medicaid participation, and thereby limit the poor population's access to health care. Thus, the proposed research project supports the overarching mission of AHRQ:  to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans. The specific aims of the proposed project are directly related to one of AHRQ's broad-based goals: to achieve efficiency through wider access to effective health care services and reductions in health care costs.  The substance of the research, an analysis of community-level effects on unevenness in physician Medicaid participation, fits into the fourth priority area of AHRQ: Payment and organization.  Also, because Medicaid patients are poor and disproportionately from racial and ethnic minority populations, the findings of this research will support AHRQ's ongoing efforts to reduce health disparities.           Project Narrative Past research has shown that the vast majority of physicians see few or no Medicaid patients, and that a relatively small number of physicians devote much of their practice to Medicaid patients. The highly skewed distribution of physician Medicaid participation limits Medicaid patients' options for care and can potentially restrict their access to care and increase health care disparities. This study examines why unevenness in physician Medicaid participation is so much greater in certain communities than in others.",Unevenness of physician Medicaid participation within communities,7661098,R03HS017490,[''],AHRQ,GOVERNORS STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2009,98127,0.16727754248354307
"Center for Health Insurance Reform, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the central policy assumptions in the U.S. today is that expanding health insurance coverage will improve access to health care, improve health outcomes, and make each more equitable for all Americans. Indeed, lack of health insurance is associated with less use of cardiovascular (CV) and other care, poor health outcomes, and increased mortality. Limited access to care is one of strongest contributors to disparities in outcomes. Massachusetts (MA) is the site of a key policy-relevant natural experiment, whereby recent legislation has resulted in 97% of the state's residents obtaining health insurance; it is thus the ideal setting in which to monitor and evaluate CV health outcomes, and disparities in such outcomes. We propose to develop the ""Center for Health Insurance Reform, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Disparities"" at Boston University School of Medicine and Boston Medical Center, New England's largest safety net hospital. We will examine the effects of MA health reform on CV care and outcomes, and in disparities in each, through two studies. The first will evaluate whether expanded insurance coverage will be associated with fewer preventable inpatient admissions for ambulatory care sensitive CV conditions and readmissions for CV conditions. This project will also assess rates of referral-sensitive cardiac procedures, and the use of safety-net hospitals by racial/ethnic minority patients. The second project will examine care and outcomes of   care for venous thromboembolism (VTE) both pre- and post-reform, examining whether increased access to primary and home care, and to outpatient pharmacy services, will be associated with better clinical outcomes, as well as improved health related quality of life, survival and cost-effectiveness. The specific aims of our Center are: 1) To conduct research to evaluate the effects of health reform in MA on CV outcomes; 2) To complement and collaborate with other existing centers in CV outcomes research. 3) To develop three Early Stage Investigators into seasoned CV outcomes researchers who are well versed in the issues, topics and methods in the field, and who, upon the completion of the center activities, will be poised to make substantial future contributions to the field of CV outcomes research.             ","Center for Health Insurance Reform, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Disparities",8016853,U01HL105342,"['cost effectiveness ', ' Caring ', ' Improve Access ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' Future ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hospitals ', ' patient home care ', ' patient homecare ', ' Home Care ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Inpatients ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Policies ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' New England ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmaceutical Services ', ' Pharmacy Services ', ' Pharmaceutic Services ', ' Staging ', ' Venous ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Seasons ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Thromboembolism ', ' Universities ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' Boston ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' safety net ', ' ']",NHLBI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2010,1487606,0.09153129458516222
"Impact of Medicare Part D on Cancer and Diabetes Disparities among Dual Enrollees    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Impact of Medicare Part D on Cancer and Diabetes Disparities among Dual Enrollees Despite the availability of effective therapies to treat chronic disease, disparities in the use of these medicines persist. Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented among the more than 7 million dual Medicaid and Medicare enrollees, who were transitioned from Medicaid to Medicare Part D drug coverage plans on January 1, 2006. Concerns have been raised about the random assignment of dual enrollees to Part D plans, due to varying benefits and reported declines in coverage. Few studies have examined the impact of coverage policy on disparities in medication use and related health outcomes. The implementation of Medicare Part D offers a unique opportunity to investigate the consequences of a major change in national coverage policy on health disparities. Our application focuses on two principal mechanisms by which Medicare Part D may impact health disparities among dual enrollees: 1) the removal of limits on the number of reimbursable prescriptions per month and 2) randomization of enrollees to plans with varying availability of medications for chronic disease management. The removal of prescription drug limits in some states may reduce gaps in medication use and, for high risk subgroups, access-related disparities in outcomes. For dual enrollees in all states, the ability to navigate Part D related changes in benefits (i.e., medication accessibility) may be mediated through patient (e.g., English language proficiency, education, usual source of care) and care setting characteristics that interact with race and ethnicity. Taking advantage of the random assignment of dual enrollees to Part D plans, we will use a strong quasi-experimental and an experimental design to investigate the impact of Medicare Part D drug coverage on racial and ethnic disparities among dual enrollees overall and among high risk chronically ill subgroups. Because of variation in Medicaid and in Part D plan benefits, each state represents a separate natural policy experiment. The goal of this study is to move beyond the documentation of health disparities to understanding the impact of coverage policy on disparities and potential mediating factors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Impact of Medicare Part D on Cancer and Diabetes Disparities among Dual Enrollees Access to appropriate health care services is a key driver of differences in health services use and outcomes by race and ethnicity. However, few studies have evaluated the impact of changes in public insurance programs (e.g., Medicaid, Medicare) on health disparities. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of a major change in national health insurance coverage (the passage of Medicare Part D) on disparities in health services use, outcomes and costs among vulnerable chronically ill patients.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Impact of Medicare Part D on Cancer and Diabetes Disparities among Dual Enrollees  Access to appropriate health care services is a key driver of differences in health services use and outcomes by race and ethnicity.

"Reducing Health Disparities: A Health IT Solution    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Reducing Health Disparities: A Health IT Solution,"" proposes a collaborative effort to coordinate community stakeholders in Dane County, WI, to integrate a replicable and innovative health IT solution to overcome systemic barriers that exacerbate health disparities and quality of health care for racial and ethnic minorities. Dane county experienced a dramatic decrease in African American infant mortality from the late 90's to 2006. While project partners research and evaluate the causes for the precipitous drop, we propose to built upon a foundation of over a decade of successful health benefits counseling coalition building; care coordination; and   benefits training for service providers and create the ""next generation"" strategy. My Coverage Plan, Inc. and partners ABC for Health Inc. (ABC), development vendor Yahara Software LLC, outpost partners St Mary's Hospital, and select advisors representing the Dane County HealthWatch Coalition, Healthy Beginnings, and The Medical Education Research Committee Infant Mortality Collaborative propose a SBIR project to develop an accessible, webbased, word-intuitive electronic health benefits screening tool called My Coverage Plan (MCP). MCP targets the reduction in primarily three avoidable health disparities: 1) the increased rate of un-insurance (economic); 2) the reduced access to care and coverage for underserved African American or Latino populations (cultural); and 3) the lack of patient-communicated information to providers (knowledge). The specific aims for the project include: 1) Design a dynamic, goal seeking decision support model (DSM); 2) Test a DSM into a prototype software application using ""if/then"" variable selection to enable health care providers to generate a patient-specific electronic document of healthcare coverage options; 3) Design a software application with a proper operating system configuration and design to ensure security of the system; meet enduser expectations; integrate HIPPA requirements; and comply with HL7 and HITSP   interoperability guidelines for Electronic Medical Records systems integration; and 4) Design a   prototype appropriate for a provider end user environment, yet replicable in broader applications. Future development phases will: test work flow integration at St. Mary's Hospital, with an available clientele of over 700 low-income individuals a year, of which 30% are Spanishspeaking, 25% are African American, and 25% have a special health care need, to demonstrate a reduced overall number of uninsured. The PI Atty. Robert Peterson is the founder of ABC for Health Inc, Inventor of the MCP process and will be the CEO of MCP Inc.      (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT): ""Reducing Health Disparities: A Health IT Solution"" proposes a community collaboration to reduce avoidable health disparities and the attendant financial impacts on patients' and health care service providers.

"Comparative Effectiveness of Health Insurance Reform on Cancer Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This application addresses broad Challenge Area (05) Comparative Effectiveness Research and specific Challenge Topic 05-MD-101*, Social Determinants of Health. We propose to conduct a comparative effectiveness analysis and cost effectiveness analysis to investigate the benefit of health insurance reform on addressing cancer health disparities. The social determinants of cancer health disparities have been described, which include access to quality health care, and insurance to pay for quality care. There is a need to investigate the comparative effectiveness of public health policies that improve access and quality of health care through improvements in health insurance as a mechanism to overcome social determinants of cancer health disparities. Specifically, we propose to investigate the comparative and cost effectiveness of health insurance reform that was instituted in 2006 in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, on the cancer outcomes of traditionally underserved women who have abnormal cervical and breast cancer screening studies. We propose to conduct this analysis using a unique database our research group has collected as part of the Boston University Patient Navigation Research Program. We have collected detailed clinical, demographic, insurance, and outcome data on over 3300 women, the entire cohort of women with abnormal breast and cervical cancer screening studies between 2004-5 and 2007-9 at 6 community health centers in Boston. Our proposed research is unique both in its approach and in the dataset to address the approach. We have collected data on a complete clinical cohort of women that health insurance reform specifically seeks to support. This dataset has the ability to observe the findings of the ""natural experiment"" of Massachusetts Health Insurance Reform, in that we began our data collection 2 years prior to insurance reform, and continued 2 years after its implementation. As many look to the Massachusetts experience to develop a national health insurance plan, our research has major impact potential on national policy. There is a critical need for empiric data on the clinical impact of health insurance reform. Our results will provide empirically derived comparative effectiveness data that is of critical interest to policy makers locally and nationally seeking to assess the benefits of insurance reform.

"A Randomized Trial of Effects of Parent Mentors on Insuring Minority Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  9.6 million US children (13%) have no health insurance, and dramatic racial/ethnic disparities exist in lacking coverage. In contrast to only 7% of white children being uninsured, 20% of Latino and 12% of African- American children are uninsured, and Latino and African-American children account for 57% of uninsured children, although comprising only 37% of all US children. Numerous studies show that being uninsured has a profound negative impact on children's health, healthcare, and mortality. Evidence suggests, however, that insuring uninsured children results in significantly improved health and healthcare. But about 70% of uninsured US children (6 million) are eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), so innovative strategies are needed to insure more children and eliminate disparities. The proposed study would be the first randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of parent mentors (PMs) to traditional Medicaid/CHIP outreach and enrollment in insuring uninsured minority children. The primary study aims are to evaluate whether PMs are more effective and more cost-effective than traditional Medicaid/CHIP outreach and enrollment in insuring eligible, uninsured Latino and African-American children. The secondary aim is to determine whether uninsured children who obtain health insurance experience improvements in healthcare access, health status, use of services, and other health outcomes.  Subjects will be 300 uninsured Latino and African-American children eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP and residing in Dallas County, where 90% of uninsured children (166,013) are Latino or African-American. Subjects will be randomized to PMs or a control group receiving traditional Medicaid/CHIP outreach. PMs are experienced parents who have at least 1 child currently covered by Medicaid/CHIP. PMs will undergo a 2-day intensive training session, and will be paired with intervention subjects and their families, for whom they will provide information on program eligibility, help families complete and submit insurance applications, act as a Medicaid/CHIP liaison, and assist in maintaining coverage. Controls will receive no intervention other than standard Medicaid/CHIP outreach. Primary outcomes will include obtaining health insurance, coverage continuity, the time interval to obtain coverage, parental satisfaction with the process of obtaining insurance, and costs; secondary outcomes will include access to care, health status, use of services, quality of life, quality of care, parental satisfaction, financial burden, and missed school and parental work days. Subjects will be contacted monthly for 1 year to monitor outcomes by a blinded assessor. Achievement of the study aims has the potential to be a significant contribution to reducing racial/ethnic disparities, empowering minority communities, providing economic revitalization through employment of minority parents, and advancing knowledge, practice, and child health policy. If successful, this intervention could serve as a national model for insuring uninsured children and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in insurance coverage.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Having no health insurance coverage has a profoundly negative impact on children's health, healthcare, and mortality, but almost 10 million US children (13%) are uninsured, and dramatic racial/ethnic disparities exist in insurance coverage. The study aims are to evaluate whether Parent Mentors (parents who already have a child covered by Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program [CHIP]) are more effective and more cost-effective than traditional Medicaid/CHIP approaches to insuring eligible, uninsured Latino and African- American children, and to determine whether minority uninsured children who obtain health insurance experience improvements in healthcare access, health status, use of services, and other health outcomes. If successful, this innovative intervention has the potential to have a major impact on reducing racial/ethnic disparities, empowering minority communities, providing economic revitalization through employment of minority parents, and advancing knowledge, practice, and child health policy; this intervention also could serve as a national model for insuring uninsured children and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in childhood insurance coverage.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Having no health insurance coverage has a profoundly negative impact on children's health, healthcare, and mortality, but almost 10 million US children (13%) are uninsured, and dramatic racial/ethnic disparities exist in insurance coverage.

"Estimating the Demand for Medicaid Financial Long-Term Care for the Elderly    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for a K01 award is to facilitate Dr. Arpita Chattopadhyay's transition to an independent investigator in the field of epidemiology of aging and long-term care with a focus on Medicaid policy. Her long-term goal is to develop an interdisciplinary program linking biomedical research on aging and disability with behavioral research in economics and sociology that focuses on utilization and financing of long-term care among the elderly. The training goals are (1) to acquire substantive knowledge in sociology and economics of aging and long-term care policies; (2) to acquire new skills in developing stochastic models of disability; and (3) to develop a frame work for estimating the determinants of disability, long-term care use, and financing. The mentoring team includes Dr. Andrew Bindman, an experienced health services researcher; Drs. Robert Newcomer and Charlene Harrington, experts in long-term care issues; Dr. Peter Bacchetti, expert in stochastic processes in chronic disease modeling; and Dr. Ronal Lee, who specializes in the demography of aging   The impact of changing racial and ethnic composition on the demand for long-term care and utilization of Medicaid for financing long-term care has not been studied. This research will overcome this shortcoming by incorporating race and ethnicity into projection models for long-term care demand and Medicaid use among the elderly. The research will address two of the priority areas at the NIA, namely aging and health /healthcare disparities and efficiency of the health system. Drawing upon data from sample surveys and administrative sources on service use, this research proposes four specific aims that correspond to four structural determinants of future long-term care use and financing. Aim 1 will determine racial and ethnic differences in age-specific prevalence of disability. Aim 2 will determine racial and ethnic differences in age specific use of long-term care for a given level of disability. Aim 3 will determine the racial and ethnic differences in use of Medicaid among the disabled elderly. Aims 1-3 will then be combined and used to obtain stochastic projection of elderly Medicaid beneficiaries in long-term care (Aim 4). A detailed microsimulation model incorporating behavioral and structural determinants of using Medicaid financed longterm care will be proposed for an R01 project at the end of the K01.    This research will enhance our understanding of long-term care needs of the elderly racial and ethnic minority population and will aid in planning service delivery for long-term care for the poor and vulnerable disabled elderly who rely on Medicaid in an effective and efficient manner.          ",Estimating the Demand for Medicaid Financial Long-Term Care for the Elderly,7782687,K01AG031304,"['Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Sociology ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Stochastic Processes ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' California ', ' skills ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' assistive living ', ' assisted living ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' community based service ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Demography ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Health system ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Long-Term Care for Elderly ', ' sex ', ' beneficiary ', ' Behavioral ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2010,118691,0.06254881053303483
"Incidence and Outcomes of Ectopic Pregnancy in the Medicaid Population    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am a family physician with a background of academic excellence, a solid introduction to health services research, and a demonstrated commitment to the well-being of disadvantaged women and children. Goals: In the long term, I aim to help improve reproductive health outcomes and eliminate disparities in maternal and child health. My five-year goal is to identify ectopic pregnancy incidence and outcomes in the Medicaid population and in the process to develop a new, widely-applicable methodology for studying ectopic pregnancy epidemiology. Career Development Plan: In order to accomplish these goals, I need to acquire the knowledge and skills to manage and analyze large administrative data sets. I will do so by taking formal courses in quantitative research methods and health policy, participating in workshops on the use of public insurance data, meeting regularly with mentors and advisors, and presenting my work internally and at national meetings for review. Research Plan: I will conduct secondary analysis of Medicaid Analytic Extract files, measuring ectopic pregnancy incidence, rate, and outcomes. I will then develop a multivariate model to explain individual and state-based variation in ectopic pregnancy. Research Environment: I am supported by a primary mentor with long-standing experience developing junior investigators; a diverse mentorship team of physicians and population scientists with relevant content and methodology expertise; an advisory board of national experts in maternal health epidemiology, Medicaid policy, and health econometrics; and an institution with proven dedication to research excellence.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ectopic pregnancy is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality.

"Optimal & Equitable Care: Medicaid Data Research Infrastructure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Purpose: This is a Data Capacity-Building Project, to build a robust comparative effectiveness research infrastructure, agenda, and collaborative partnerships focused on eliminating health disparities. Specifically we will build a database comprised of all Medicaid enrollees and claims in the states that share in common both adverse minority health outcomes and the historical roots of racial health disparities in the South.       Setting & Participants: Our CMS data request has already been approved and we have actually purchased (but not yet received) a 100% sample of four years (2004-07) of Medicaid Analytic Extract (MAX-file) data (plus Medicare-linked claims for dual-eligibles) from fourteen southern states, representing 3.8 to 5.4 million persons each year (one-third of all U.S. Medicaid enrollees, nearly half [48%] of African American and 21 % of Latino Medicaid enrollees in the U.S). This region is the epicenter of the black-white health disparities epidemic, and has also experienced a recent and rapid influx of Latino immigrants. Our HBCU-based team has previously had extensive experience training health services researchers (especially minority investigators) to use Medicaid claims data for research, but we currently lack the personnel and infrastructure support needed to efficiently organize and analyze these data to support minority investigators.      Specific Alms: Using Medicaid Claims Data: 1. To build a Medicaid claims data set (including socio-economic, contextual, and geospatial analytic variables, NDC cross-walk data and therapeutic class codes, as well as certain Medicare data for dualeligibles) to support projects focused on the intersection between disparities research and comparative effectiveness research in clinically and socially complex patient populations. 2. To create an efficient process for assisting non-Morehouse investigators to develop research protocols, analysis plans, CMS data re-use requests, and analytic files for collaborative research. 3. To train, develop, cultivate, and support emerging minority investigators (especially at HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions) as independently-funded health services researchers who are increasingly proficient in multivariate analysis of Medicaid and Medicare claims data. 4. Cultivate comparative effectiveness and disparities research collaborations with Georgia Tech experts in mathematics, complexity science, simulation modeling, and interactive computing.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medicaid patients are characterized by clinical and social complexity - the very characteristics that often exclude them from clinical trials and yet drive health disparities. This Medicaid based data set will populate studies that help us understand how local-area, provider-level, and patient-level differences in treatment (natural experiments in comparative effectiveness) influence clinical and economic outcomes. Variation implies that disparities are not inevitable. The comparative impact of this natural variation can be measured in meaningful outcomes such as emergency department visits, hospital admissions, inpatient bed-days, deaths, and total Medicaid expenditures, as well as community-level disparity rate-ratios. Medicaid data allow us to follow a complex patient (e.g., co-morbid diabetes and schizophrenia or COPD and CHF) from treatment to outcomes through every billable service in the healthcare system {i.e., from doctor's visit to lab tests to prescriptions to emergency room visits or hospital admissions).

Many of the nearly 15 million US adults insured by Medicaid are Black or Hispanic and therefore, evaluating cancer care delivery in the context of these state health insurance programs is a logical strategy to identify the sources of disparities. By merging Medicaid enrollment and claims files with tumor registry data from New York and California, 2 states with large ethnically diverse populations and many Medicaid enrollees, we seek to identify how access to safety net health insurance and race/ethnicity intersect with common cancer diagnoses. The overarching questions we will address are: Where are there opportunities for decreasing the cancer burden for the poor? Does cancer care delivery in Medicaid achieve reasonable quality benchmarks? Do racial disparities in treatment persist within Medicaid? Specifically, we will evaluate aspects of care we understand well based on our team's prior work using Medicare-registry linked data: 1) Stage distribution at diagnosis, a marker for cancer severity and access to medical care; 2) Cancer surgery and the receipt of complex operations at experienced hospitals with high procedure volume; and, 3) Adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy treatments for cancers where these interventions improve outcomes. Analyses will focus on common solid tumors among two groups of Medicaid enrollees: adults aged 21-64 and the elderly aged 65+ dually enrolled in Medicare. We will evaluate care patterns for Medicaid patients and where data permit, compare them to patterns for otherwise similar persons not covered by Medicaid. Specifically, for each important aspect of cancer care we will also measure racial/ethnic disparities within the Medicaid program and test our hypothesis that they are minimized for patients with long term enrollment prior to diagnosis. More generally, this project will construct a resource for health services researchers, characterize its yield, and use it to identify and prioritize specific opportunities to improve cancer care delivery for vulnerable Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer care is not as good as it should be for all Americans. It is well known that care is sub-optimal for persons who are poor, many of whom are insured by State Medicaid programs. This study asks the question, is cancer care as good as it should be for patients who receive their health insurance from state Medicaid programs? Do patients who have long term access to Medicaid present with more advanced stage disease? Do they receive necessary treatments? Do the gaps in care on the basis of race and ethnicity exist within the Medicaid program? Is the information recorded on Medicaid claims reliable enough to identify important aspects of cancer treatment like surgery, radiation and chemotherapy? Could linkage of Medicaid enrollment and/or claims data to cancer registry data provide a framework for ongoing monitoring of quality of care? By examining data from New York and California which have large multiethnic populations and many persons living in poverty, this study will answer these questions and identify opportunities to improve cancer care delivery to poor Americans.                   ",Cancer Care Delivery in Medicaid,7849028,R01CA131847,"['Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Caliber ', ' Diameter ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Sum ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Monitor ', ' Esophageal ', ' Adjuvant ', ' beneficiary ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' tumor registry ', ' Hospitals ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Medicaid ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' New York ', ' Solid Neoplasm ', ' Solid Tumor ', ' Pancreas ', ' Pancreatic ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Registries ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' Performance ', ' care delivery ', ' cohort ', ' Breast ', ' California ', ' member ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Metric ', ' social ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Cervix ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' cancer registry ', ' Radiation ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiosurgery ', ' Stereotaxic Radiosurgery ', ' Stereotactic Radiosurgery ', ' Stereotactic External Beam Irradiation ', ' Radiation Surgery ', ' Adjuvant Chemotherapy ', ' Adjuvant Drug Therapy ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' cancer surgery ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' safety net ', ' chemotherapy ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' operation ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Colon ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' 21 year old ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' ']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2010,408935,0.15098416068523404
"Cancer Care among Medicare HIV patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: In the post highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) period, large numbers of people living with HIV/AIDS are aging. Persons with HIV infection have increased rates or altered clinical presentations of several neoplastic diseases such as cancer. At the same time, age is also a risk factor for many cancers. Thus, aging HIV/AIDS patients face the dual risk of non-AIDS defining cancers: infection related cancers and age related cancers. For people with HIV/AIDS who receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits or those who live long enough to qualify, Medicare is an important source of health coverage. For effective health care planning, it is important to determine the incremental burden of non-AIDS defining cancers among Medicare HIV/AIDS patients. Study objective is to assess the incidence and prevalence rates of non-AIDS defining cancers, and the associated mortality rates and determine the marginal burden of non-AIDS defining cancers on health resource utilization and cost in Medicare HIV/AIDS patients. Specific aims: (1) To estimate non-AIDS defining cancer incidence and prevalence, non-AIDS defining cancer screening pattern and time to non-AIDS defining cancer treatment (from the date of non-AIDS defining cancer diagnosis) in Medicare patients with and without HIV/AIDS; (2) To analyze incremental burden of health resource utilization and the cost of care and mortality across four study groups; and (3) To examine extent that the HIV group differs from the comparison groups in age, race/ethnicity, gender and geographic location in the above estimates of non-AIDS defining cancer incidence and prevalence, health resource utilization, cost and mortality. Methods: To accomplish these aims, we propose a retrospective design using linked data from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data files and Medicare claims data. All Caucasian, African American and Hispanic persons aged 66 or older or those with SSDI benefits and diagnosed with any non-AIDS defining cancer between 1996 and 2005 will be identified. A control group of Medicare patients, free of any cancer, matched by age, gender, ethnicity and comorbidity will be obtained from the Medicare 5% sample from SEER. The following groups will be identified: (1) Medicare patients with any non-AIDS defining cancer and HIV/AIDS; (2) Medicare patients with any non-AIDS defining cancer and no HIV/AIDS; (3) Medicare patients with HIV/AIDS and no cancer; and (4) Medicare controls free of cancer and HIV/AIDS. All Medicare claims associated with the individuals in these groups will be obtained and person level records will be constructed. Statistical Analysis: Standardized Incidence ratios (SIR) (age, race and gender adjusted) will be compared between groups. Health resource utilization will be compared between groups longitudinally. Poisson regression (with zero inflation correction) will be used to assess health resource utilization. We will use GLM (log-link) models to estimate the incremental cost of cancer. We will explore if disparities (racial, gender, age and geography specific) exist in non-AIDS defining cancer incidence and prevalence, time to treatment of non-AIDS defining cancer (from date of diagnosis of non-AIDS defining cancer), health resource utilization, cost and mortality using parametric and non-parametric analysis. Conclusions: The AIDS epidemic is entering a chronic disease phase. The marginal burden of an additional chronic disease such as non-AIDS defining cancer in Medicare HIV patients can be significant. However, current research on this topic is limited. Thus, our study will provide valuable preliminary estimates of the incidence and prevalence of non-AIDS defining cancers in HIV Medicare population, and the marginal treatment and cost burden exerted by these non- AIDS defining cancers. Such information will aid in planning for the more effective management of Medicare patients with HIV.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The AIDS epidemic is entering a chronic disease phase.

"Oral Health Disparities Among Medicaid Beneficiaries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is very limited information on the burden of oral and pharyngeal cancers for specials needs populations, including the frail elderly, the disabled, and those with AIDS/HIV. In addition, significant racial disparities exist, as black males have a much lower 5-year survival rate compared with white males. Medicaid is an important source of insurance coverage for low-income racial and ethnic minorities, and also for the special needs populations. Medicaid administrative data linked with cancer registry data can provide a powerful data source to understand health disparities among these subgroups. This study will analyze 1999 through 2004 Medicaid administrative data and statewide all-payer discharge data (to identify comparison groups, including those insured by private payers and Medicare) linked with cancer registry databases to address three specific objectives: (1) assess the ability to study the special needs population and comparison cohorts with oral and pharyngeal cancers in the linked databases; (2) generate descriptive statistics on the incidence of cancer, stage at diagnosis, and cancer mortality among priority populations (based on findings from the data quality assessment performed under objective 1) and compare with other populations; and (3) assess the utility of the linked database to study treatment patterns among priority populations. Data from the states of Georgia, Illinois, South Carolina, and Texas were selected based on specific selection criteria, including large Medicaid fee-for-serve populations and a high burden of oral and pharyngeal cancers. To address objective 1, we will assess the quality of linkage between Medicaid claims and the statewide discharge data with the cancer registry data, the ability to identify specific subgroups, and availability of adequate sample sizes to perform assessments. For objective 2, we will produce unadjusted and age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates. We will also generate the annual percentage change and perform joinpoint regression analysis to identify points where a significant change in the linear slope of the trend occurs. For objective 3, we will assess the number of months of continuous enrollment available in Medicaid, evaluate the percentage of claims with missing values, and assess the ability to identify relevant procedures and treatments using ICD-9 and CPT-4 codes. If this proposed study shows that claims data are of adequate quality to systematically study oral cancer treatments and address health disparities, a follow-on application will be submitted to perform comparative assessments of treatment patterns using cancer registry data linked with Medicaid, Medicare, and private payer claims data.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medicaid is an important source of insurance coverage for low-income racial and ethnic minorities, as well as special needs populations, including the frail elderly, the disabled, and those with HIV/AIDS.

"A Randomized Trial of Effects of Parent Mentors on Insuring Minority Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  9.6 million US children (13%) have no health insurance, and dramatic racial/ethnic disparities exist in lacking coverage. In contrast to only 7% of white children being uninsured, 20% of Latino and 12% of African- American children are uninsured, and Latino and African-American children account for 57% of uninsured children, although comprising only 37% of all US children. Numerous studies show that being uninsured has a profound negative impact on children's health, healthcare, and mortality. Evidence suggests, however, that insuring uninsured children results in significantly improved health and healthcare. But about 70% of uninsured US children (6 million) are eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), so innovative strategies are needed to insure more children and eliminate disparities. The proposed study would be the first randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of parent mentors (PMs) to traditional Medicaid/CHIP outreach and enrollment in insuring uninsured minority children. The primary study aims are to evaluate whether PMs are more effective and more cost-effective than traditional Medicaid/CHIP outreach and enrollment in insuring eligible, uninsured Latino and African-American children. The secondary aim is to determine whether uninsured children who obtain health insurance experience improvements in healthcare access, health status, use of services, and other health outcomes.  Subjects will be 300 uninsured Latino and African-American children eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP and residing in Dallas County, where 90% of uninsured children (166,013) are Latino or African-American. Subjects will be randomized to PMs or a control group receiving traditional Medicaid/CHIP outreach. PMs are experienced parents who have at least 1 child currently covered by Medicaid/CHIP. PMs will undergo a 2-day intensive training session, and will be paired with intervention subjects and their families, for whom they will provide information on program eligibility, help families complete and submit insurance applications, act as a Medicaid/CHIP liaison, and assist in maintaining coverage. Controls will receive no intervention other than standard Medicaid/CHIP outreach. Primary outcomes will include obtaining health insurance, coverage continuity, the time interval to obtain coverage, parental satisfaction with the process of obtaining insurance, and costs; secondary outcomes will include access to care, health status, use of services, quality of life, quality of care, parental satisfaction, financial burden, and missed school and parental work days. Subjects will be contacted monthly for 1 year to monitor outcomes by a blinded assessor. Achievement of the study aims has the potential to be a significant contribution to reducing racial/ethnic disparities, empowering minority communities, providing economic revitalization through employment of minority parents, and advancing knowledge, practice, and child health policy. If successful, this intervention could serve as a national model for insuring uninsured children and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in insurance coverage.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Having no health insurance coverage has a profoundly negative impact on children's health, healthcare, and mortality, but almost 10 million US children (13%) are uninsured, and dramatic racial/ethnic disparities exist in insurance coverage.

"Estimating the Demand for Medicaid Financial Long-Term Care for the Elderly    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for a K01 award is to facilitate Dr. Arpita Chattopadhyay's transition to an independent investigator in the field of epidemiology of aging and long-term care with a focus on Medicaid policy. Her long-term goal is to develop an interdisciplinary program linking biomedical research on aging and disability with behavioral research in economics and sociology that focuses on utilization and financing of long-term care among the elderly. The training goals are (1) to acquire substantive knowledge in sociology and economics of aging and long-term care policies; (2) to acquire new skills in developing stochastic models of disability; and (3) to develop a frame work for estimating the determinants of disability, long-term care use, and financing. The mentoring team includes Dr. Andrew Bindman, an experienced health services researcher; Drs. Robert Newcomer and Charlene Harrington, experts in long-term care issues; Dr. Peter Bacchetti, expert in stochastic processes in chronic disease modeling; and Dr. Ronal Lee, who specializes in the demography of aging   The impact of changing racial and ethnic composition on the demand for long-term care and utilization of Medicaid for financing long-term care has not been studied. This research will overcome this shortcoming by incorporating race and ethnicity into projection models for long-term care demand and Medicaid use among the elderly. The research will address two of the priority areas at the NIA, namely aging and health /healthcare disparities and efficiency of the health system. Drawing upon data from sample surveys and administrative sources on service use, this research proposes four specific aims that correspond to four structural determinants of future long-term care use and financing. Aim 1 will determine racial and ethnic differences in age-specific prevalence of disability. Aim 2 will determine racial and ethnic differences in age specific use of long-term care for a given level of disability.

"Reducing disparities in diabetes through expanded insurance coverage.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): type 2 diabetes causes a disproportionate health burden among racial and ethnic minorities in the United States. At the same time, these minority populations are among those most likely to be uninsured or to experience interruptions in healthcare coverage. Lack of insurance is associated with a greater probability of having undiagnosed diabetes, and with poorer quality of care for patients with diagnosed diabetes. As healthcare reform moves toward implementation following the passage of national legislation, important gaps remain in the understanding of the expected population health effects of expanding insurance coverage, and especially regarding the likely impact on health disparities. With respect to diabetes in particular, there is urgent need for a comprehensive analysis that traces the entire pathway from insurance to reduced morbidity and mortality, and provides a unifying framework for previous observational and quasi- experimental studies. The overall goal of this proposed study is to deploy systematic and rigorous empirical analysis to investigate the potential impact of expanding insurance coverage on health disparities in diabetes, at the national and state level. The project has three specific aims: 1) Quantify the potential impact of expanding insurance coverage among diabetic patients, in terms of  improvements in key modifiable risk factors (e.g. high blood glucose) associated with major  complications of diabetes, by racial and ethnic group. 2) Predict, based on alternative population risk factor distributions reflecting different insurance coverage scenarios, reductions in racial/ethnic disparities in diabetes-related morbidity and mortality attributable to  expanded insurance coverage. 3) Evaluate the validity of the model results by comparing predicted and observed outcomes in Massachusetts following the expansion of insurance coverage through the landmark 2006 health reform. Collectively, the proposed research activities will constitute a coherent, significant and innovative advance in addressing critical gaps in policy-relevant information on diabetes disparities that are amenable to improvements through changes in the healthcare system. This information is essential for identifying key priorities and setting realistic targets for reducing health disparities, and for defining critical benchmarks for evaluating progress towards these objectives as major developments in national healthcare policy evolve.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial and ethnic minorities in the United States bear a disproportionate health burden from diabetes, and are also most likely to lack continuous health insurance. Lack of insurance is associated with a greater chance of having undiagnosed diabetes, and with poorer quality of care for patients with diagnosed diabetes. As healthcare reform moves toward implementation following the passage of national legislation, this project aims to provide a rigorous, systematic and comprehensive examination of the potential impact of expanding insurance coverage on health disparities in diabetes.           Racial and ethnic minorities in the United States bear a disproportionate health burden from diabetes, and are also most likely to lack continuous health insurance.

"Reducing Disparities in Mental Health Expenditure Among Children in Child Welfare    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children coming into contact with child welfare agencies constitute what has been described as the dominant public mental health problem when it comes to children. These approximately 5.8 million children are disproportionately non-white, and display considerable race/ethnic disparities in their utilization of mental health services. What makes these disparities especially pernicious is that virtually all of these children have entitlements to Medicaid. Medicaid agencies' ability to reduce these disparities occurring among its beneficiaries is hampered by the lack of information on what factors result in differential utilization of services among children of different race/ethnicities, which has the potential risk of worsening mental health outcomes among this highly vulnerable population.  For the first time in the field of child welfare research, members of this research team are assembling a unique data set that links the respondents of a national survey of children in child welfare to their Medicaid claims data, along with information on Medicaid and mental health policies within their counties of residence. Such a linkage combines the richness of person-level information contained in survey data - such as need for mental health services identified using standardized psychometric measures - with the use and expenditure information contained in claims data. In the present study, we propose to complete construction of this data set, and then conduct longitudinal data analysis to (1) model race/ethnic differences in mental health service utilization (ambulatory mental health service use, inpatient hospitalizations, psychotropic medication use, overall service volume, and timeliness of services) and expenditures among a national sample of children in child welfare; (2) estimate race/ethnic differences in mental health services utilization and expenditure trajectories over the childhood development cycle (ages 0- 18 years) among these children; and (3) examine the role of care consistent with national standards as mediators of race/ethnic differences in mental health service utilization and expenditures (from Aim 1), and use and expenditure trajectories (from Aim 2), among these children; and (4) effects of Medicaid policies (presumptive eligibility, managed care, and system coordination) on race/ethnic differences in mental health service utilization and expenditures (from Aim 1), and use and expenditure trajectories (from Aim 2), among these children  This proposal by a new investigator brings together a highly experienced team of senior investigators and a state Medicaid policymaker to address these salient issues with respect to Medicaid coverage of a very vulnerable child population. This proposal is aligned to several Federal and NIH priorities, including the NIMH Strategic Plan, several reports of the Surgeon-General, publications from the Institute of Medicine, and several of the proposed objectives from Healthy People 2020, all of which call for policy action that can reduce and eliminate disparities in mental health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Race/ethnic disparities in access to needed mental health services is a national public health concern, highlighted in several publications from the Institute of Medicine, the Surgeon-General, and Healthy People 2020 objectives. These disparities are especially prevalent among children in the child welfare system, a group with the highest needs for mental health services among child populations, and a group that paradoxically possesses entitlements to Medicaid. Clearly, Medicaid agencies require better information on the magnitude of these disparities both cross-sectionally and over time, as well as an investigation of which Medicaid policies may worsen disparities among this vulnerable population. For the first time in child welfare research, this study links national survey data of children in child welfare with Medicaid claims data to identify, quantify, and appropriately resource care for children at risk for disparities in access to services. In the context of health reform, this proposal provides a unique opportunity to examine how disparities among these children can be reduced through Medicaid policy action.              Race/ethnic disparities in access to needed mental health services is a national public health concern, highlighted in several publications from the Institute of Medicine, the Surgeon-General, and Healthy People 2020 objectives.

"Health Implications of MTM Eligibility Criteria    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) implemented in 2006 by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requires prescription drug (Part D) plans for Medicare beneficiaries to establish medication therapy management (MTM) programs with a purpose to ""optimize therapeutic outcomes ... by improving medication use and reducing adverse events..."" MTM services are particularly beneficial for patients with chronic diseases, in whose management pharmacotherapy plays a major role, such as hypertension and diabetes, and especially the elderly. Because the prevalence of these diseases and prevalence of poor control of them are higher in racial and ethnic minorities than Whites, MTM could be an important tool for reducing these disparities. However, our recently published analyses of historical data demonstrate that racial and ethnic minorities would be less likely to be eligible for MTM than Whites. This result is not surprising considering that MTM eligibility criteria are based predominantly on previous drug utilization and costs, and racial and ethnic minorities historically tend to use fewer prescription drugs and incur lower prescription drug costs than do Whites. To understand the health implications of MTM eligibility criteria for minorities, we propose to address whether the racial and ethnic disparities in health status, health services utilization and costs, and medication utilization patterns among MTM-eligible individuals are different from the disparities among MTM-ineligible individuals. This is an important question because greater disparities among MTM-ineligible individuals would suggest that the MTM eligibility criteria have the potential to aggravate racial and ethnic disparities. It is important to include as study outcomes health status, health services utilization and costs, and medication utilization patterns, because the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordability Care Act (PPACA) and the existing literature identified improvements of these aspects as outcomes to achieve through providing MTM services. Racial and ethnic disparities in all these aspects have also been reported. The National Institute on Aging has identified racial and ethnic disparities among Medicare beneficiaries as a funding priority. Our Specific Aim is to compare, using the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey linked to Medicare claims records, racial and ethnic disparities in study outcomes among MTM-eligible and MTM- ineligible Medicare beneficiaries based on various government regulations and policies. We will analyze policy scenarios by using data from before and after Part D implementation, comparing 2004-2005 and 2007-2008 relative to changes from 2001-2002 to 2004-2005, and determine the impact of the MTM eligibility criteria laid out in MMA and PPACA. We will use a variety of multivariate modeling techniques. Because our pilot data already showed greater racial disparities in health status among the MTM-ineligible than the MTM-eligible, this study is highly likely to produce meaningful results. Our long-term goal is to determine the types of government policies and congressional legislations that can reduce disparities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The National Institute on Aging has identified racial and ethnic disparities among Medicare beneficiaries as a funding priority.

"Universal Health Insurance and the Adequacy and Efficiency of Health Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Universal Health Insurance and the Adequacy and Efficiency of Health Care This project will use comparisons between people just under and just over age 65 to measure how the availability of nearly universal health insurance for those over 65 affects the use of primary care versus Emergency Department services; the quality of health care services provided outside the hospital, and the treatment intensity and health outcomes of people admitted to the hospital for acute myocardial infarction. The results from this project will be directly policy-relevant as they will help to quantify the effects of insurance coverage (or lack of coverage) on the efficiency and efficacy of the health care delivery system for older adults. They will also provide valuable information for evaluating the costs of extending health insurance coverage to previously uncovered individuals. The findings will also provide new insights into the disparities in treatment of acute myocardial infarction patients across different patient groups, and how these disparities affect the health of these groups.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will use comparisons between people just over age 65 (nearly all of whom are covered by Medicare) and those just under age 65 (many of whom lack adequate health insurance) to learn how the availability of health insurance affects the use of Emergency Departments for non-urgent care, the rate of hospitalization for ""preventable"" causes, and the types of treatments provided to hospital patients admitted for heart attacks.

"Center for Health Insurance Reform, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the central policy assumptions in the U.S. today is that expanding health insurance coverage will improve access to health care, improve health outcomes, and make each more equitable for all Americans. Indeed, lack of health insurance is associated with less use of cardiovascular (CV) and other care, poor health outcomes, and increased mortality. Limited access to care is one of strongest contributors to disparities in outcomes. Massachusetts (MA) is the site of a key policy-relevant natural experiment, whereby recent legislation has resulted in 97% of the state's residents obtaining health insurance; it is thus the ideal setting in which to monitor and evaluate CV health outcomes, and disparities in such outcomes. We propose to develop the ""Center for Health Insurance Reform, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Disparities"" at Boston University School of Medicine and Boston Medical Center, New England's largest safety net hospital. We will examine the effects of MA health reform on CV care and outcomes, and in disparities in each, through two studies. The first will evaluate whether expanded insurance coverage will be associated with fewer preventable inpatient admissions for ambulatory care sensitive CV conditions and readmissions for CV conditions. This project will also assess rates of referral-sensitive cardiac procedures, and the use of safety-net hospitals by racial/ethnic minority patients. The second project will examine care and outcomes of   care for venous thromboembolism (VTE) both pre- and post-reform, examining whether increased access to primary and home care, and to outpatient pharmacy services, will be associated with better clinical outcomes, as well as improved health related quality of life, survival and cost-effectiveness. The specific aims of our Center are: 1) To conduct research to evaluate the effects of health reform in MA on CV outcomes; 2) To complement and collaborate with other existing centers in CV outcomes research. 3) To develop three Early Stage Investigators into seasoned CV outcomes researchers who are well versed in the issues, topics and methods in the field, and who, upon the completion of the center activities, will be poised to make substantial future contributions to the field of CV outcomes research.             ","Center for Health Insurance Reform, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Disparities",8146167,U01HL105342,"['New England ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' Hospitals ', ' Massachusetts ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' American ', ' Seasons ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Venous ', ' Pharmaceutical Services ', ' Pharmacy Services ', ' Pharmaceutic Services ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Improve Access ', ' Inpatients ', ' patient home care ', ' patient homecare ', ' Home Care ', ' Policies ', ' Clinical ', ' Universities ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Future ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research ', ' Methods ', ' Medical center ', ' Monitor ', ' Patients ', ' Health ', ' Outcome ', ' improved ', ' Boston ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Staging ', ' Procedures ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Site ', ' Cardiac ', ' Caring ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' safety net ', ' Thromboembolism ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' ']",NHLBI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2011,2327657,0.09153129458516222
"Cancer Care among Medicare HIV patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: In the post highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) period, large numbers of people living with HIV/AIDS are aging. Persons with HIV infection have increased rates or altered clinical presentations of several neoplastic diseases such as cancer. At the same time, age is also a risk factor for many cancers. Thus, aging HIV/AIDS patients face the dual risk of non-AIDS defining cancers: infection related cancers and age related cancers. For people with HIV/AIDS who receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits or those who live long enough to qualify, Medicare is an important source of health coverage. For effective health care planning, it is important to determine the incremental burden of non-AIDS defining cancers among Medicare HIV/AIDS patients. Study objective is to assess the incidence and prevalence rates of non-AIDS defining cancers, and the associated mortality rates and determine the marginal burden of non-AIDS defining cancers on health resource utilization and cost in Medicare HIV/AIDS patients. Specific aims: (1) To estimate non-AIDS defining cancer incidence and prevalence, non-AIDS defining cancer screening pattern and time to non-AIDS defining cancer treatment (from the date of non-AIDS defining cancer diagnosis) in Medicare patients with and without HIV/AIDS; (2) To analyze incremental burden of health resource utilization and the cost of care and mortality across four study groups; and (3) To examine extent that the HIV group differs from the comparison groups in age, race/ethnicity, gender and geographic location in the above estimates of non-AIDS defining cancer incidence and prevalence, health resource utilization, cost and mortality. Methods: To accomplish these aims, we propose a retrospective design using linked data from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data files and Medicare claims data. All Caucasian, African American and Hispanic persons aged 66 or older or those with SSDI benefits and diagnosed with any non-AIDS defining cancer between 1996 and 2005 will be identified. A control group of Medicare patients, free of any cancer, matched by age, gender, ethnicity and comorbidity will be obtained from the Medicare 5% sample from SEER. The following groups will be identified: (1) Medicare patients with any non-AIDS defining cancer and HIV/AIDS; (2) Medicare patients with any non-AIDS defining cancer and no HIV/AIDS; (3) Medicare patients with HIV/AIDS and no cancer; and (4) Medicare controls free of cancer and HIV/AIDS. All Medicare claims associated with the individuals in these groups will be obtained and person level records will be constructed. Statistical Analysis: Standardized Incidence ratios (SIR) (age, race and gender adjusted) will be compared between groups. Health resource utilization will be compared between groups longitudinally. Poisson regression (with zero inflation correction) will be used to assess health resource utilization. We will use GLM (log-link) models to estimate the incremental cost of cancer. We will explore if disparities (racial, gender, age and geography specific) exist in non-AIDS defining cancer incidence and prevalence, time to treatment of non-AIDS defining cancer (from date of diagnosis of non-AIDS defining cancer), health resource utilization, cost and mortality using parametric and non-parametric analysis. Conclusions: The AIDS epidemic is entering a chronic disease phase. The marginal burden of an additional chronic disease such as non-AIDS defining cancer in Medicare HIV patients can be significant. However, current research on this topic is limited. Thus, our study will provide valuable preliminary estimates of the incidence and prevalence of non-AIDS defining cancers in HIV Medicare population, and the marginal treatment and cost burden exerted by these non- AIDS defining cancers. Such information will aid in planning for the more effective management of Medicare patients with HIV.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The AIDS epidemic is entering a chronic disease phase.

"Impact of Medicare Part D on Cancer and Diabetes Disparities among Dual Enrollees    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Impact of Medicare Part D on Cancer and Diabetes Disparities among Dual Enrollees Despite the availability of effective therapies to treat chronic disease, disparities in the use of these medicines persist. Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented among the more than 7 million dual Medicaid and Medicare enrollees, who were transitioned from Medicaid to Medicare Part D drug coverage plans on January 1, 2006. Concerns have been raised about the random assignment of dual enrollees to Part D plans, due to varying benefits and reported declines in coverage. Few studies have examined the impact of coverage policy on disparities in medication use and related health outcomes. The implementation of Medicare Part D offers a unique opportunity to investigate the consequences of a major change in national coverage policy on health disparities. Our application focuses on two principal mechanisms by which Medicare Part D may impact health disparities among dual enrollees: 1) the removal of limits on the number of reimbursable prescriptions per month and 2) randomization of enrollees to plans with varying availability of medications for chronic disease management. The removal of prescription drug limits in some states may reduce gaps in medication use and, for high risk subgroups, access-related disparities in outcomes. For dual enrollees in all states, the ability to navigate Part D related changes in benefits (i.e., medication accessibility) may be mediated through patient (e.g., English language proficiency, education, usual source of care) and care setting characteristics that interact with race and ethnicity. Taking advantage of the random assignment of dual enrollees to Part D plans, we will use a strong quasi-experimental and an experimental design to investigate the impact of Medicare Part D drug coverage on racial and ethnic disparities among dual enrollees overall and among high risk chronically ill subgroups. Because of variation in Medicaid and in Part D plan benefits, each state represents a separate natural policy experiment. The goal of this study is to move beyond the documentation of health disparities to understanding the impact of coverage policy on disparities and potential mediating factors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Impact of Medicare Part D on Cancer and Diabetes Disparities among Dual Enrollees Access to appropriate health care services is a key driver of differences in health services use and outcomes by race and ethnicity. However, few studies have evaluated the impact of changes in public insurance programs (e.g., Medicaid, Medicare) on health disparities. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of a major change in national health insurance coverage (the passage of Medicare Part D) on disparities in health services use, outcomes and costs among vulnerable chronically ill patients.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Impact of Medicare Part D on Cancer and Diabetes Disparities among Dual Enrollees  Access to appropriate health care services is a key driver of differences in health services use and outcomes by race and ethnicity.

"The Effects of State and Federal Insurance Policies on Quality of Care for Autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism and other autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are complex developmental disorders characterized by repetitive behavior and delayed social interaction and communication. Autism affects approximately 1 in 110 children, with symptoms occurring as early as 18 months of age and continuing throughout the individual's life. Although there is no consensus about the most effective treatments for ASD, studies have shown early  intervention to enhance cognitive and adaptive functioning and early educational attainment. Who pays for ASD services, however, is often unclear. There are considerable differences in states' approaches to financing ASD services and supporting programs for children with ASD. Many states have implemented Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) waivers under their Medicaid programs, which expand coverage to  children with ASD who might not otherwise qualify for Medicaid or have access to specialized services. There is considerable variation across states, however, in the number of children included and the services offered. In addition, some states have passed legislation requiring private insurers, who traditionally have limited or excluded coverage for individuals with ASD, to cover specific ASD services or to provide coverage at a level on par with other disorders. The challenges in identifying, accessing, navigating and paying for ASD services available in a given community, given the complexity of a child's needs, available services, and these financing arrangements, can place a substantial burden on parents and caregivers of children with ASD. Although previous studies have examined satisfaction with care and the impact of having a child with ASD on parental income and employment, little is known about the effects of state policies regarding coverage and financing of services for children with ASD on these outcomes, or whether these effects differ by race/ethnicity. This study would explore these effects using data from multiple waves of two national surveys of children's health: the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs and the National Survey of Children's Health.  Data from these surveys span the period 2001 through 2011, a time when many states implemented Medicaid waiver programs and passed insurance coverage mandates for ASD. We will examine the effects of these policies on access to care, satisfaction and family burden among children with ASD and their families in both publicly and privately insured populations. We will also explore whether characteristics of the waivers (e.g., eligibility criteria, benefit limits, etc.) or of the mandates (e.g., coverage lmits, whether specific services [such as physical therapy, speech therapy or applied behavioral analysis] must be covered, etc.) are associated with changes in access to care, family burden and satisfaction, and whether these effects differ by race/ethnicity. In addition to informing futue Medicaid HCBS waivers and insurance coverage mandates, the results of the study will be instrumental in implementing the Federal Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act and  health care reform.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The challenges in identifying, accessing, navigating and paying for ASD services available in a given community, given the complexity of a child's needs, available services, and financing arrangements, can place a substantial burden on parents and caregivers of children with ASD.

"Cancer Care Delivery in Medicaid    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Shortcomings in cancer care disproportionately affect minority group members and contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in cancer mortality. Many of the nearly 15 million US adults insured by Medicaid are Black or Hispanic and therefore, evaluating cancer care delivery in the context of these state health insurance programs is a logical strategy to identify the sources of disparities. By merging Medicaid enrollment and claims files with tumor registry data from New York and California, 2 states with large ethnically diverse populations and many Medicaid enrollees, we seek to identify how access to safety net health insurance and race/ethnicity intersect with common cancer diagnoses. The overarching questions we will address are: Where are there opportunities for decreasing the cancer burden for the poor? Does cancer care delivery in Medicaid achieve reasonable quality benchmarks? Do racial disparities in treatment persist within Medicaid? Specifically, we will evaluate aspects of care we understand well based on our team's prior work using Medicare-registry linked data: 1) Stage distribution at diagnosis, a marker for cancer severity and access to medical care; 2) Cancer surgery and the receipt of complex operations at experienced hospitals with high procedure volume; and, 3) Adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy treatments for cancers where these interventions improve outcomes. Analyses will focus on common solid tumors among two groups of Medicaid enrollees: adults aged 21-64 and the elderly aged 65+ dually enrolled in Medicare. We will evaluate care patterns for Medicaid patients and where data permit, compare them to patterns for otherwise similar persons not covered by Medicaid. Specifically, for each important aspect of cancer care we will also measure racial/ethnic disparities within the Medicaid program and test our hypothesis that they are minimized for patients with long term enrollment prior to diagnosis. More generally, this project will construct a resource for health services researchers, characterize its yield, and use it to identify and prioritize specific opportunities to improve cancer care delivery for vulnerable Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer care is not as good as it should be for all Americans. It is well known that care is sub-optimal for persons who are poor, many of whom are insured by State Medicaid programs. This study asks the question, is cancer care as good as it should be for patients who receive their health insurance from state Medicaid programs? Do patients who have long term access to Medicaid present with more advanced stage disease? Do they receive necessary treatments? Do the gaps in care on the basis of race and ethnicity exist within the Medicaid program? Is the information recorded on Medicaid claims reliable enough to identify important aspects of cancer treatment like surgery, radiation and chemotherapy? Could linkage of Medicaid enrollment and/or claims data to cancer registry data provide a framework for ongoing monitoring of quality of care? By examining data from New York and California which have large multiethnic populations and many persons living in poverty, this study will answer these questions and identify opportunities to improve cancer care delivery to poor Americans.

My five-year goal is to identify ectopic pregnancy incidence and outcomes in the Medicaid population and in the process to develop a new, widely-applicable methodology for studying ectopic pregnancy epidemiology. Career Development Plan: In order to accomplish these goals, I need to acquire the knowledge and skills to manage and analyze large administrative data sets. I will do so by taking formal courses in quantitative research methods and health policy, participating in workshops on the use of public insurance data, meeting regularly with mentors and advisors, and presenting my work internally and at national meetings for review. Research Plan: I will conduct secondary analysis of Medicaid Analytic Extract files, measuring ectopic pregnancy incidence, rate, and outcomes. I will then develop a multivariate model to explain individual and state-based variation in ectopic pregnancy. Research Environment: I am supported by a primary mentor with long-standing experience developing junior investigators; a diverse mentorship team of physicians and population scientists with relevant content and methodology expertise; an advisory board of national experts in maternal health epidemiology, Medicaid policy, and health econometrics; and an institution with proven dedication to research excellence.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ectopic pregnancy is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Current knowledge of ectopic pregnancy epidemiology is lacking, especially for low-income women. My work will inform policy and clinical interventions to improve early pregnancy outcomes and reduce health disparities.

"Universal Health Insurance and the Adequacy and Efficiency of Health Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Universal Health Insurance and the Adequacy and Efficiency of Health Care This project will use comparisons between people just under and just over age 65 to measure how the availability of nearly universal health insurance for those over 65 affects the use of primary care versus Emergency Department services; the quality of health care services provided outside the hospital, and the treatment intensity and health outcomes of people admitted to the hospital for acute myocardial infarction. The results from this project will be directly policy-relevant as they will help to quantify the effects of insurance coverage (or lack of coverage) on the efficiency and efficacy of the health care delivery system for older adults. They will also provide valuable information for evaluating the costs of extending health insurance coverage to previously uncovered individuals. The findings will also provide new insights into the disparities in treatment of acute myocardial infarction patients across different patient groups, and how these disparities affect the health of these groups.        This project will use comparisons between people just over age 65 (nearly all of whom are covered by Medicare) and those just under age 65 (many of whom lack adequate health insurance) to learn how the availability of health insurance affects the use of Emergency Departments for non-urgent care, the rate of hospitalization for ""preventable"" causes, and the types of treatments provided to hospital patients admitted for heart attacks. These comparisons will help us to better understand the potential benefits and costs of expanding health insurance coverage.

"Estimating the Demand for Medicaid Financial Long-Term Care for the Elderly DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for a K01 award is to facilitate Dr. Arpita Chattopadhyay's transition to an independent investigator in the field of epidemiology of aging and long-term care with a focus on Medicaid policy. Her long-term goal is to develop an interdisciplinary program linking biomedical research on aging and disability with behavioral research in economics and sociology that focuses on utilization and financing of long-term care among the elderly. The training goals are (1) to acquire substantive knowledge in sociology and economics of aging and long-term care policies; (2) to acquire new skills in developing stochastic models of disability; and (3) to develop a frame work for estimating the determinants of disability, long-term care use, and financing. The mentoring team includes Dr. Andrew Bindman, an experienced health services researcher; Drs. Robert Newcomer and Charlene Harrington, experts in long-term care issues; Dr. Peter Bacchetti, expert in stochastic processes in chronic disease modeling; and Dr. Ronal Lee, who specializes in the demography of aging   The impact of changing racial and ethnic composition on the demand for long-term care and utilization of Medicaid for financing long-term care has not been studied. This research will overcome this shortcoming by incorporating race and ethnicity into projection models for long-term care demand and Medicaid use among the elderly. The research will address two of the priority areas at the NIA, namely aging and health /healthcare disparities and efficiency of the health system. Drawing upon data from sample surveys and administrative sources on service use, this research proposes four specific aims that correspond to four structural determinants of future long-term care use and financing. Aim 1 will determine racial and ethnic differences in age-specific prevalence of disability. Aim 2 will determine racial and ethnic differences in age specific use of long-term care for a given level of disability. Aim 3 will determine the racial and ethnic differences in use of Medicaid among the disabled elderly. Aims 1-3 will then be combined and used to obtain stochastic projection of elderly Medicaid beneficiaries in long-term care (Aim 4). A detailed microsimulation model incorporating behavioral and structural determinants of using Medicaid financed longterm care will be proposed for an R01 project at the end of the K01.    This research will enhance our understanding of long-term care needs of the elderly racial and ethnic minority population and will aid in planning service delivery for long-term care for the poor and vulnerable disabled elderly who rely on Medicaid in an effective and efficient manner.",Estimating the Demand for Medicaid Financial Long-Term Care for the Elderly,8235907,K01AG031304,"['Epidemiology ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Economics ', ' Goals ', ' Race ', ' Caring ', ' Future ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Sociology ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Surveys ', ' Stochastic Processes ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Asians ', ' California ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Medicaid ', ' Work ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Demography ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanics ', ' African American ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Area ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Knowledge ', ' Health system ', ' programs ', ' disability ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Policies ', ' Home environment ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' skills ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled people ', ' Disease model ', ' sex ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' community based service ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' health care service ', ' Data ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Mortality ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Address ', ' beneficiary ', ' Behavioral ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Adult Human ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' adulthood ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' Long-Term Care for Elderly ', ' oriental ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' nursing home ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Researchers ', ' extended care ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' Black or African American ', ' black American ', ' health care ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' disorder model ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' assisted living ', ' assistive living ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' Home ', ' Investigators ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2012,118691,0.06254881053303483
"Center of Excellence on Quality of Care Measures for Children with Complex Needs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Research and policy related to children has focused on expanding eligibility for public insurance programs, but expanding access to a system that does not deliver necessary services will not result in optimal outcomes. Deficits in care delivery must be identified if appropriate strategies to close the gaps are to be developed and implemented. Title IV of the Child Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) called for the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to identify and post for public comment an initial, recommended core set of children's health care quality measures for voluntary use by Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Programs (CHIP). While this initial core set of measures represents a good starting place, it is just the first step in a long term process to develop a rigorous, standardized set of measures that will facilitate routine quality assessment and guidance on priorities for improving children's healthcare quality. Several deficits were identified during the selection of the initial core set of measures mandated by the CHIPRA legislation. These included a dearth of measures for particular types of care and care settings as well as an inability to adequately collect data on race, ethnicity, and special health care need status to monitor variations in care and disparities. Additionally, no quality measures were identified that assess ""most integrated health care settings."" For this project we have assembled a Center of Excellence on Quality of Care Measures for Children with Complex Needs (COE4CCN). The COE4CCN brings together a diverse and talented group of organizations and individuals who have the expertise and capacity to rigorously develop and test quality measures that address all of the above mentioned areas of deficit. The COE4CCN includes experts in the areas of survey measure development, evidence-based process measure development using medical records and/or administrative data, risk adjustment, assessing disparities, and appropriately identifying and stratifying children with special health care needs into meaningful risk categories. Additionally, the COE4CCN brings together content experts in several key areas including the medical home, caring for CSHCN, child and adolescent mental and behavioral health, chronic disease management in adolescents, racial/ethnic disparities, and health informatics. Several key stakeholder groups will also be integral members of the COE4CCN, including representatives from Medicaid and CHIP programs in two states (WA and MN), representatives from the AAP Chapters in WA and MN, and representatives from MN Family Voices. The COE4CCN will have the ability to develop meaningful, rigorously designed, disseminable quality measures that can be used at the national level to both track and improve on the quality of care provided to US children.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The quality of care measures we propose to develop under this award will provide new tools to rigorously and comprehensively evaluate health care for children with complex needs. Without such measurement tools, it is not possible to assess where deficits exist and how to target efforts to best improve care. These measures will be designed for dissemination and use among all Medicaid and Child Health Insurance Programs (CHIP) nationally.

"A Randomized Trial of Effects of Parent Mentors on Insuring Minority Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  9.6 million US children (13%) have no health insurance, and dramatic racial/ethnic disparities exist in lacking coverage. In contrast to only 7% of white children being uninsured, 20% of Latino and 12% of African- American children are uninsured, and Latino and African-American children account for 57% of uninsured children, although comprising only 37% of all US children. Numerous studies show that being uninsured has a profound negative impact on children's health, healthcare, and mortality. Evidence suggests, however, that insuring uninsured children results in significantly improved health and healthcare. But about 70% of uninsured US children (6 million) are eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), so innovative strategies are needed to insure more children and eliminate disparities. The proposed study would be the first randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of parent mentors (PMs) to traditional Medicaid/CHIP outreach and enrollment in insuring uninsured minority children. The primary study aims are to evaluate whether PMs are more effective and more cost-effective than traditional Medicaid/CHIP outreach and enrollment in insuring eligible, uninsured Latino and African-American children. The secondary aim is to determine whether uninsured children who obtain health insurance experience improvements in healthcare access, health status, use of services, and other health outcomes.  Subjects will be 300 uninsured Latino and African-American children eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP and residing in Dallas County, where 90% of uninsured children (166,013) are Latino or African-American. Subjects will be randomized to PMs or a control group receiving traditional Medicaid/CHIP outreach. PMs are experienced parents who have at least 1 child currently covered by Medicaid/CHIP. PMs will undergo a 2-day intensive training session, and will be paired with intervention subjects and their families, for whom they will provide information on program eligibility, help families complete and submit insurance applications, act as a Medicaid/CHIP liaison, and assist in maintaining coverage. Controls will receive no intervention other than standard Medicaid/CHIP outreach. Primary outcomes will include obtaining health insurance, coverage continuity, the time interval to obtain coverage, parental satisfaction with the process of obtaining insurance, and costs; secondary outcomes will include access to care, health status, use of services, quality of life, quality of care, parental satisfaction, financial burden, and missed school and parental work days. Subjects will be contacted monthly for 1 year to monitor outcomes by a blinded assessor. Achievement of the study aims has the potential to be a significant contribution to reducing racial/ethnic disparities, empowering minority communities, providing economic revitalization through employment of minority parents, and advancing knowledge, practice, and child health policy. If successful, this intervention could serve as a national model for insuring uninsured children and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in insurance coverage.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Having no health insurance coverage has a profoundly negative impact on children's health, healthcare, and mortality, but almost 10 million US children (13%) are uninsured, and dramatic racial/ethnic disparities exist in insurance coverage. The study aims are to evaluate whether Parent Mentors (parents who already have a child covered by Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program [CHIP]) are more effective and more cost-effective than traditional Medicaid/CHIP approaches to insuring eligible, uninsured Latino and African- American children, and to determine whether minority uninsured children who obtain health insurance experience improvements in healthcare access, health status, use of services, and other health outcomes. If successful, this innovative intervention has the potential to have a major impact on reducing racial/ethnic disparities, empowering minority communities, providing economic revitalization through employment of minority parents, and advancing knowledge, practice, and child health policy; this intervention also could serve as a national model for insuring uninsured children and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in childhood insurance coverage.

"Reducing Disparities in Mental Health Expenditure Among Children in Child Welfare    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children coming into contact with child welfare agencies constitute what has been described as the dominant public mental health problem when it comes to children. These approximately 5.8 million children are disproportionately non-white, and display considerable race/ethnic disparities in their utilization of mental health services. What makes these disparities especially pernicious is that virtually all of these children have entitlements to Medicaid. Medicaid agencies' ability to reduce these disparities occurring among its beneficiaries is hampered by the lack of information on what factors result in differential utilization of services among children of different race/ethnicities, which has the potential risk of worsening mental health outcomes among this highly vulnerable population.  For the first time in the field of child welfare research, members of this research team are assembling a unique data set that links the respondents of a national survey of children in child welfare to their Medicaid claims data, along with information on Medicaid and mental health policies within their counties of residence. Such a linkage combines the richness of person-level information contained in survey data - such as need for mental health services identified using standardized psychometric measures - with the use and expenditure information contained in claims data. In the present study, we propose to complete construction of this data set, and then conduct longitudinal data analysis to (1) model race/ethnic differences in mental health service utilization (ambulatory mental health service use, inpatient hospitalizations, psychotropic medication use, overall service volume, and timeliness of services) and expenditures among a national sample of children in child welfare; (2) estimate race/ethnic differences in mental health services utilization and expenditure trajectories over the childhood development cycle (ages 0- 18 years) among these children; and (3) examine the role of care consistent with national standards as mediators of race/ethnic differences in mental health service utilization and expenditures (from Aim 1), and use and expenditure trajectories (from Aim 2), among these children; and (4) effects of Medicaid policies (presumptive eligibility, managed care, and system coordination) on race/ethnic differences in mental health service utilization and expenditures (from Aim 1), and use and expenditure trajectories (from Aim 2), among these children  This proposal by a new investigator brings together a highly experienced team of senior investigators and a state Medicaid policymaker to address these salient issues with respect to Medicaid coverage of a very vulnerable child population. This proposal is aligned to several Federal and NIH priorities, including the NIMH Strategic Plan, several reports of the Surgeon-General, publications from the Institute of Medicine, and several of the proposed objectives from Healthy People 2020, all of which call for policy action that can reduce and eliminate disparities in mental health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Race/ethnic disparities in access to needed mental health services is a national public health concern, highlighted in several publications from the Institute of Medicine, the Surgeon-General, and Healthy People 2020 objectives. These disparities are especially prevalent among children in the child welfare system, a group with the highest needs for mental health services among child populations, and a group that paradoxically possesses entitlements to Medicaid. Clearly, Medicaid agencies require better information on the magnitude of these disparities both cross-sectionally and over time, as well as an investigation of which Medicaid policies may worsen disparities among this vulnerable population. For the first time in child welfare research, this study links national survey data of children in child welfare with Medicaid claims data to identify, quantify, and appropriately resource care for children at risk for disparities in access to services. In the context of health reform, this proposal provides a unique opportunity to examine how disparities among these children can be reduced through Medicaid policy action.

"Reducing disparities in diabetes through expanded insurance coverage.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): type 2 diabetes causes a disproportionate health burden among racial and ethnic minorities in the United States. At the same time, these minority populations are among those most likely to be uninsured or to experience interruptions in healthcare coverage. Lack of insurance is associated with a greater probability of having undiagnosed diabetes, and with poorer quality of care for patients with diagnosed diabetes. As healthcare reform moves toward implementation following the passage of national legislation, important gaps remain in the understanding of the expected population health effects of expanding insurance coverage, and especially regarding the likely impact on health disparities. With respect to diabetes in particular, there is urgent need for a comprehensive analysis that traces the entire pathway from insurance to reduced morbidity and mortality, and provides a unifying framework for previous observational and quasi- experimental studies. The overall goal of this proposed study is to deploy systematic and rigorous empirical analysis to investigate the potential impact of expanding insurance coverage on health disparities in diabetes, at the national and state level. The project has three specific aims: 1) Quantify the potential impact of expanding insurance coverage among diabetic patients, in terms of  improvements in key modifiable risk factors (e.g. high blood glucose) associated with major  complications of diabetes, by racial and ethnic group. 2) Predict, based on alternative population risk factor distributions reflecting different insurance coverage scenarios, reductions in racial/ethnic disparities in diabetes-related morbidity and mortality attributable to  expanded insurance coverage. 3) Evaluate the validity of the model results by comparing predicted and observed outcomes in Massachusetts following the expansion of insurance coverage through the landmark 2006 health reform. Collectively, the proposed research activities will constitute a coherent, significant and innovative advance in addressing critical gaps in policy-relevant information on diabetes disparities that are amenable to improvements through changes in the healthcare system. This information is essential for identifying key priorities and setting realistic targets for reducing health disparities, and for defining critical benchmarks for evaluating progress towards these objectives as major developments in national healthcare policy evolve.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial and ethnic minorities in the United States bear a disproportionate health burden from diabetes, and are also most likely to lack continuous health insurance.

"Health Implications of MTM Eligibility Criteria    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) implemented in 2006 by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requires prescription drug (Part D) plans for Medicare beneficiaries to establish medication therapy management (MTM) programs with a purpose to ""optimize therapeutic outcomes ... by improving medication use and reducing adverse events..."" MTM services are particularly beneficial for patients with chronic diseases, in whose management pharmacotherapy plays a major role, such as hypertension and diabetes, and especially the elderly. Because the prevalence of these diseases and prevalence of poor control of them are higher in racial and ethnic minorities than Whites, MTM could be an important tool for reducing these disparities. However, our recently published analyses of historical data demonstrate that racial and ethnic minorities would be less likely to be eligible for MTM than Whites. This result is not surprising considering that MTM eligibility criteria are based predominantly on previous drug utilization and costs, and racial and ethnic minorities historically tend to use fewer prescription drugs and incur lower prescription drug costs than do Whites. To understand the health implications of MTM eligibility criteria for minorities, we propose to address whether the racial and ethnic disparities in health status, health services utilization and costs, and medication utilization patterns among MTM-eligible individuals are different from the disparities among MTM-ineligible individuals. This is an important question because greater disparities among MTM-ineligible individuals would suggest that the MTM eligibility criteria have the potential to aggravate racial and ethnic disparities. It is important to include as study outcomes health status, health services utilization and costs, and medication utilization patterns, because the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordability Care Act (PPACA) and the existing literature identified improvements of these aspects as outcomes to achieve through providing MTM services. Racial and ethnic disparities in all these aspects have also been reported. The National Institute on Aging has identified racial and ethnic disparities among Medicare beneficiaries as a funding priority. Our Specific Aim is to compare, using the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey linked to Medicare claims records, racial and ethnic disparities in study outcomes among MTM-eligible and MTM- ineligible Medicare beneficiaries based on various government regulations and policies. We will analyze policy scenarios by using data from before and after Part D implementation, comparing 2004-2005 and 2007-2008 relative to changes from 2001-2002 to 2004-2005, and determine the impact of the MTM eligibility criteria laid out in MMA and PPACA. We will use a variety of multivariate modeling techniques. Because our pilot data already showed greater racial disparities in health status among the MTM-ineligible than the MTM-eligible, this study is highly likely to produce meaningful results. Our long-term goal is to determine the types of government policies and congressional legislations that can reduce disparities.        The National Institute on Aging has identified racial and ethnic disparities among Medicare beneficiaries as a funding priority. This research project assesses the impact of Federal policies on medication therapy management services for Medicare beneficiaries in terms of racial and ethnic disparities in health status, health services utilization and costs, medication utilization patterns, and the implications for disparities in therapeutic outcomes.

This information is essential for identifying key priorities and setting realistic targets for reducing health disparities, and for defining critical benchmarks for evaluating progress towards these objectives as major developments in national healthcare policy evolve.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial and ethnic minorities in the United States bear a disproportionate health burden from diabetes, and are also most likely to lack continuous health insurance. Lack of insurance is associated with a greater chance of having undiagnosed diabetes, and with poorer quality of care for patients with diagnosed diabetes. As healthcare reform moves toward implementation following the passage of national legislation, this project aims to provide a rigorous, systematic and comprehensive examination of the potential impact of expanding insurance coverage on health disparities in diabetes.

"Center of Excellence on Quality of Care Measures for Children with Complex Needs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Research and policy related to children has focused on expanding eligibility for public insurance programs, but expanding access to a system that does not deliver necessary services will not result in optimal outcomes. Deficits in care delivery must be identified if appropriate strategies to close the gaps are to be developed and implemented. Title IV of the Child Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) called for the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to identify and post for public comment an initial, recommended core set of children's health care quality measures for voluntary use by Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Programs (CHIP). While this initial core set of measures represents a good starting place, it is just the first step in a long term process to develop a rigorous, standardized set of measures that will facilitate routine quality assessment and guidance on priorities for improving children's healthcare quality. Several deficits were identified during the selection of the initial core set of measures mandated by the CHIPRA legislation. These included a dearth of measures for particular types of care and care settings as well as an inability to adequately collect data on race, ethnicity, and special health care need status to monitor variations in care and disparities. Additionally, no quality measures were identified that assess ""most integrated health care settings."" For this project we have assembled a Center of Excellence on Quality of Care Measures for Children with Complex Needs (COE4CCN). The COE4CCN brings together a diverse and talented group of organizations and individuals who have the expertise and capacity to rigorously develop and test quality measures that address all of the above mentioned areas of deficit. The COE4CCN includes experts in the areas of survey measure development, evidence-based process measure development using medical records and/or administrative data, risk adjustment, assessing disparities, and appropriately identifying and stratifying children with special health care needs into meaningful risk categories. Additionally, the COE4CCN brings together content experts in several key areas including the medical home, caring for CSHCN, child and adolescent mental and behavioral health, chronic disease management in adolescents, racial/ethnic disparities, and health informatics. Several key stakeholder groups will also be integral members of the COE4CCN, including representatives from Medicaid and CHIP programs in two states (WA and MN), representatives from the AAP Chapters in WA and MN, and representatives from MN Family Voices. The COE4CCN will have the ability to develop meaningful, rigorously designed, disseminable quality measures that can be used at the national level to both track and improve on the quality of care provided to US children.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The quality of care measures we propose to develop under this award will provide new tools to rigorously and comprehensively evaluate health care for children with complex needs. Without such measurement tools, it is not possible to assess where deficits exist and how to target efforts to best improve care. These measures will be designed for dissemination and use among all Medicaid and Child Health Insurance Programs (CHIP) nationally.

"Reducing Health Disparities: A Health IT Solution   PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT My Coverage Plan Inc. (MCP) proposes to use our newly patented technology to create a commercially viable and nationally replicable suite of software and services for health care providers and other social service agencies that reduces avoidable health disparities and increases provider reimbursements. The MCP health IT solution will help providers proactively identify coverage options for patients with health disparities and help them maintain coverage by generating an electronic health care coverage record. Many Americans lack adequate health care coverage, a statistic especially true of disparity populations. The lack of insurance coverage harms both patients and providers. Patients risk poor medical outcomes and high debt burdens. And providers who serve these patients seldom receive full reimbursement for the medical care provided. Health care systems typically pass these losses to paying consumers and insurers. MCP proposes to address health disparities by offering a replicable software and service package that allows providers to proactively, accurately, and efficiently identify and secure coverage for disparity patients. The complexity inherent with the implementation of health care reform only heightens the need for improved provider services for patients with disparities. During Phase I, MCP established proof of concept and built a prototype of the benefits eligibility screening software. Building on the success of Phase I research and development, MCP proposes the following three aims for Phase II: 1) Expand MCP's screening capacity to fully locate, rank and record optimal public and or private coverage options for disparity patients across the age and disability spectrum; 2) Test and refine the screening tool for cultural and linguistic competence, maximum accuracy, usability and national replication; 3) Demonstrate the positive impact for disparity patients and measure the cost benefits for providers of MCP's offering in multiple settings. MCP is well prepared to carry out this project. MCP's President, Robert ""Bobby"" Peterson is an attorney and health care financing expert with over 25 years of experience in understanding and navigating complex programs for low-income disparity populations. MCP's parent company, founded by Mr. Peterson, ABC for Health, Inc., has provided health benefits counseling to low-income and minority patients for more than 18 years. Partner, ABC for Health will provide health benefits expertise to inform product development and testing. Other MCP committed partners include urban and rural hospitals and providers that serve disparity populations in Wisconsin. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: My Coverage Plan, Inc., (MCP) proposes a Phase II renewal of ""Reducing Health Disparities: A Health IT Solution"" to further demonstrate our software and service strategy that efficiently identifies public and private health coverage options for patient with health disparities across the age and disability spectrum and increase provider reimbursements. MCP demonstrated in Phase I that our software application promotes the proper coordination and maximization of public and private sources of health care and help reduce avoidable health disparities as patients' secure available coverage and avoid medical-debt and uncompensated care and achieve improved health outcomes.            ",Reducing Health Disparities: A Health IT Solution,8549519,R44MD005810,"['Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Counseling ', ' Electronics ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Hospitals ', ' Rural Hospitals ', ' Metropolitan Hospitals ', ' City Hospitals ', ' Urban Hospitals ', ' Insurers ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Logic ', ' Marketing ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Rural Health ', ' Sales ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Social work (field) ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Solutions ', ' statistics ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Wisconsin ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' Decision Modeling ', ' Health Benefit ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Attorneys ', ' Lawyers ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' healthcare financing ', ' healthcare costs financing ', ' healthcare cost/financing ', ' health care financing ', ' health care costs financing ', ' health care cost/financing ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Uncompensated Care ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Rural ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Monitor ', ' informant ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Chronic Care ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' product development ', ' clinical practice ', ' Secure ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIMHD,"MY COVERAGE PLAN, INC.",R44,2013,373279,0.0772261627045372
"Estimating the Demand for Medicaid Financial Long-Term Care for the Elderly DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for a K01 award is to facilitate Dr. Arpita Chattopadhyay's transition to an independent investigator in the field of epidemiology of aging and long-term care with a focus on Medicaid policy. Her long-term goal is to develop an interdisciplinary program linking biomedical research on aging and disability with behavioral research in economics and sociology that focuses on utilization and financing of long-term care among the elderly. The training goals are (1) to acquire substantive knowledge in sociology and economics of aging and long-term care policies; (2) to acquire new skills in developing stochastic models of disability; and (3) to develop a frame work for estimating the determinants of disability, long-term care use, and financing. The mentoring team includes Dr. Andrew Bindman, an experienced health services researcher; Drs. Robert Newcomer and Charlene Harrington, experts in long-term care issues; Dr. Peter Bacchetti, expert in stochastic processes in chronic disease modeling; and Dr. Ronal Lee, who specializes in the demography of aging   The impact of changing racial and ethnic composition on the demand for long-term care and utilization of Medicaid for financing long-term care has not been studied. This research will overcome this shortcoming by incorporating race and ethnicity into projection models for long-term care demand and Medicaid use among the elderly. The research will address two of the priority areas at the NIA, namely aging and health /healthcare disparities and efficiency of the health system. Drawing upon data from sample surveys and administrative sources on service use, this research proposes four specific aims that correspond to four structural determinants of future long-term care use and financing. Aim 1 will determine racial and ethnic differences in age-specific prevalence of disability. Aim 2 will determine racial and ethnic differences in age specific use of long-term care for a given level of disability. Aim 3 will determine the racial and ethnic differences in use of Medicaid among the disabled elderly. Aims 1-3 will then be combined and used to obtain stochastic projection of elderly Medicaid beneficiaries in long-term care (Aim 4). A detailed microsimulation model incorporating behavioral and structural determinants of using Medicaid financed longterm care will be proposed for an R01 project at the end of the K01.    This research will enhance our understanding of long-term care needs of the elderly racial and ethnic minority population and will aid in planning service delivery for long-term care for the poor and vulnerable disabled elderly who rely on Medicaid in an effective and efficient manner.",Estimating the Demand for Medicaid Financial Long-Term Care for the Elderly,8434128,K01AG031304,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' California ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Demography ', ' Economics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' extended care ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Sociology ', ' Stochastic Processes ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Caring ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' assistive living ', ' assisted living ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Long-Term Care for Elderly ', ' sex ', ' beneficiary ', ' Behavioral ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' community based service ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2013,118691,0.06254881053303483
"Center for Health Insurance Reform, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the central policy assumptions in the U.S. today is that expanding health insurance coverage will improve access to health care, improve health outcomes, and make each more equitable for all Americans. Indeed, lack of health insurance is associated with less use of cardiovascular (CV) and other care, poor health outcomes, and increased mortality. Limited access to care is one of strongest contributors to disparities in outcomes. Massachusetts (MA) is the site of a key policy-relevant natural experiment, whereby recent legislation has resulted in 97% of the state's residents obtaining health insurance; it is thus the ideal setting in which to monitor and evaluate CV health outcomes, and disparities in such outcomes. We propose to develop the ""Center for Health Insurance Reform, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Disparities"" at Boston University School of Medicine and Boston Medical Center, New England's largest safety net hospital. We will examine the effects of MA health reform on CV care and outcomes, and in disparities in each, through two studies. The first will evaluate whether expanded insurance coverage will be associated with fewer preventable inpatient admissions for ambulatory care sensitive CV conditions and readmissions for CV conditions. This project will also assess rates of referral-sensitive cardiac procedures, and the use of safety-net hospitals by racial/ethnic minority patients. The second project will examine care and outcomes of   care for venous thromboembolism (VTE) both pre- and post-reform, examining whether increased access to primary and home care, and to outpatient pharmacy services, will be associated with better clinical outcomes, as well as improved health related quality of life, survival and cost-effectiveness. The specific aims of our Center are: 1) To conduct research to evaluate the effects of health reform in MA on CV outcomes; 2) To complement and collaborate with other existing centers in CV outcomes research. 3) To develop three Early Stage Investigators into seasoned CV outcomes researchers who are well versed in the issues, topics and methods in the field, and who, upon the completion of the center activities, will be poised to make substantial future contributions to the field of CV outcomes research.

"Reducing disparities in diabetes through expanded insurance coverage.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): type 2 diabetes causes a disproportionate health burden among racial and ethnic minorities in the United States. At the same time, these minority populations are among those most likely to be uninsured or to experience interruptions in healthcare coverage. Lack of insurance is associated with a greater probability of having undiagnosed diabetes, and with poorer quality of care for patients with diagnosed diabetes. As healthcare reform moves toward implementation following the passage of national legislation, important gaps remain in the understanding of the expected population health effects of expanding insurance coverage, and especially regarding the likely impact on health disparities. With respect to diabetes in particular, there is urgent need for a comprehensive analysis that traces the entire pathway from insurance to reduced morbidity and mortality, and provides a unifying framework for previous observational and quasi- experimental studies. The overall goal of this proposed study is to deploy systematic and rigorous empirical analysis to investigate the potential impact of expanding insurance coverage on health disparities in diabetes, at the national and state level. The project has three specific aims: 1) Quantify the potential impact of expanding insurance coverage among diabetic patients, in terms of  improvements in key modifiable risk factors (e.g. high blood glucose) associated with major  complications of diabetes, by racial and ethnic group. 2) Predict, based on alternative population risk factor distributions reflecting different insurance coverage scenarios, reductions in racial/ethnic disparities in diabetes-related morbidity and mortality attributable to  expanded insurance coverage. 3) Evaluate the validity of the model results by comparing predicted and observed outcomes in Massachusetts following the expansion of insurance coverage through the landmark 2006 health reform.

"A Randomized Trial of Effects of Parent Mentors on Insuring Minority Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  9.6 million US children (13%) have no health insurance, and dramatic racial/ethnic disparities exist in lacking coverage. In contrast to only 7% of white children being uninsured, 20% of Latino and 12% of African- American children are uninsured, and Latino and African-American children account for 57% of uninsured children, although comprising only 37% of all US children. Numerous studies show that being uninsured has a profound negative impact on children's health, healthcare, and mortality. Evidence suggests, however, that insuring uninsured children results in significantly improved health and healthcare. But about 70% of uninsured US children (6 million) are eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), so innovative strategies are needed to insure more children and eliminate disparities. The proposed study would be the first randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of parent mentors (PMs) to traditional Medicaid/CHIP outreach and enrollment in insuring uninsured minority children. The primary study aims are to evaluate whether PMs are more effective and more cost-effective than traditional Medicaid/CHIP outreach and enrollment in insuring eligible, uninsured Latino and African-American children. The secondary aim is to determine whether uninsured children who obtain health insurance experience improvements in healthcare access, health status, use of services, and other health outcomes.  Subjects will be 300 uninsured Latino and African-American children eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP and residing in Dallas County, where 90% of uninsured children (166,013) are Latino or African-American. Subjects will be randomized to PMs or a control group receiving traditional Medicaid/CHIP outreach. PMs are experienced parents who have at least 1 child currently covered by Medicaid/CHIP. PMs will undergo a 2-day intensive training session, and will be paired with intervention subjects and their families, for whom they will provide information on program eligibility, help families complete and submit insurance applications, act as a Medicaid/CHIP liaison, and assist in maintaining coverage. Controls will receive no intervention other than standard Medicaid/CHIP outreach. Primary outcomes will include obtaining health insurance, coverage continuity, the time interval to obtain coverage, parental satisfaction with the process of obtaining insurance, and costs; secondary outcomes will include access to care, health status, use of services, quality of life, quality of care, parental satisfaction, financial burden, and missed school and parental work days. Subjects will be contacted monthly for 1 year to monitor outcomes by a blinded assessor. Achievement of the study aims has the potential to be a significant contribution to reducing racial/ethnic disparities, empowering minority communities, providing economic revitalization through employment of minority parents, and advancing knowledge, practice, and child health policy. If successful, this intervention could serve as a national model for insuring uninsured children and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in insurance coverage.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Having no health insurance coverage has a profoundly negative impact on children's health, healthcare, and mortality, but almost 10 million US children (13%) are uninsured, and dramatic racial/ethnic disparities exist in insurance coverage. The study aims are to evaluate whether Parent Mentors (parents who already have a child covered by Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program [CHIP]) are more effective and more cost-effective than traditional Medicaid/CHIP approaches to insuring eligible, uninsured Latino and African- American children, and to determine whether minority uninsured children who obtain health insurance experience improvements in healthcare access, health status, use of services, and other health outcomes. If successful, this innovative intervention has the potential to have a major impact on reducing racial/ethnic disparities, empowering minority communities, providing economic revitalization through employment of minority parents, and advancing knowledge, practice, and child health policy; this intervention also could serve as a national model for insuring uninsured children and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in childhood insurance coverage.

"Disparities in Cancer Screening: The Role of Medicaid Policy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study examines how existing and new policies that affect the generosity of state Medicaid programs impact breast and cervical cancer screening and related health outcomes among low-income women. There are substantial disparities in breast and cervical cancer diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes in the United States by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic and insurance status. Further, resources to improve access to and quality of care for underserved populations are limited. In recent years, the federal government granted many states increased flexibility to cover low-income adults through Medicaid waivers. Further expansions to Medicaid are anticipated under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Current variation in state Medicaid programs and anticipated changes under the ACA provide natural experiments for studying the effect of public insurance on screening for low-income women. We consider the effect of pre- and post-reform variation in eligibility between and within states, as well as the effect of physician payment and patient cost sharing on screening. Understanding how state Medicaid policies affect cancer screening will help guide strategies to reach under-screened populations and add to evidence regarding the costs and benefits of different policies. In addition, we study how variation in Medicaid generosity across states and over time is related to outcomes including cancer incidence and stage at diagnosis, the single most important predictor of survival. The project brings together complementary secondary data from a number of sources. Nationally representative survey data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System will be used to study the effects of Medicaid eligibility on breast and cervical cancer screening among low-income populations. Medicaid administrative claims and utilization data will allow us to consider the effects of changes in eligibility as well as physician payment and patient cost sharing on screening among Medicaid enrollees. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry data will be used to estimate the effects of changes in Medicaid generosity on cancer incidence and stage at diagnosis. Our analytic approach employs a quasi- experimental design to compare changes in outcomes among groups that would have been affected by changes in Medicaid policy (eligibility, payment rates, or cost sharing) to similar groups that were not subject to polcy changes. In addition to considering the effect of policy changes on all low-income women, we will examine whether effects of expansions are larger among racial and ethnic minorities, reducing disparities. This is the first study to consider the effect of recent Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, physician payment, and cost sharing on breast and cervical cancer screening, which are the most important measures for the prevention of breast and cervical cancer morbidity and mortality. The results will provide timely evidence on how Medicaid policy affects women's preventive healthcare utilization and health outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Low-income women are less likely to receive recommended cancer screenings that can lead to earlier detection and treatment that subsequently reduces morbidity and mortality. This project examines how state Medicaid policies impact breast and cervical cancer screening and related health outcomes among low-income women, and results will help guide strategies to reach under-screened populations and add to evidence regarding the costs and benefits of policies related to Medicaid eligibility, physician payment, and benefit design. Understanding factors influencing screening rates among underserved populations is critical for ensuring efficient use of healthcare resources and reducing inequalities in cancer care and outcomes across socioeconomic and racial groups.            ",Disparities in Cancer Screening: The Role of Medicaid Policy,8562222,R01CA178980,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' National Government ', ' Federal Government ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' inducement ', ' Incentives ', ' Incidence ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Laws ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Tumor Staging ', ' Neoplasm Staging ', ' Cancer Staging ', ' Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Policy ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' Treatment outcome ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' falls ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Ensure ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' cervical cancer early detection ', ' Cervical Cancer Screening ', ' mammary tumor prevention ', ' mammary cancer prevention ', ' Breast Cancer Prevention ', ' Staging ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' payment ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' BRFSS ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' financial incentive ', ' waiver ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,316438,0.07872551893217025
"Health Insurance, Non-Deferrable Health Events and Financial Risk Enter the text here that is the new abstract information for your application. This section must be no longer than 30 lines of text. The goal of this study is to estimate the impact of health insurance on financial risk among the young elderly (ages 65-80) relative to the near elderly (ages 50-64). The near elderly are ineligible for Medicare based on age but are more likely than the general population to have serious health conditions and thus be exposed to medical expenditure risk (Williams et al. 2010). While less than 1 percent of the elderly are uninsured, almost 15 percent of the near elderly lacked insurance in 2010 (KFF 2011b). Thus, health insurance has the potential to significantly affect exposure to financial risk for the elderly relative to the near elderly. We will use 15 years (1996-2010) of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), the highest quality nationally representative data containing information on health insurance coverage, health conditions, and total and out-of-pocket medical spending, both overall and by category (e.g. inpatient, outpatient). We will supplement the MEPS analysis with secondary data on medical- related financial stress from the Health Tracking Household Survey (HTHS) and unique primary data collected on the actual and perceived financial risk associated with health spending from the RAND American Life Panel (ALP). Using these data this exploratory project will address the following aims: (1) Estimate the relationship between health insurance and actual and perceived financial risk in an regression discontinuity framework, exploiting the discontinuity in Medicare coverage at age 65. (2) Investigate heterogeneity in the impact of Medicare on both actual and perceived financial risk across education and race/ethnicity groups as well as its impact on disparities in financial risk. (3) Estimate the welfare change from Medicare-related changes in risk exposure in an expected utility framework and compare this change to the social cost of the program. Financial risk protection is the primary motivation behind any insurance scheme. At older ages, health insurance can safeguard consumption, playing a potentially significant role in protecting the well-being of the elderly. This work aims to estimate the impact of health insurance on actual and perceived medical expenditure risk among the young elderly (ages 65-80) relative to near (50-64) elderly. We will analyze both high quality secondary data on actual spending and unique primary data on perceived risk in a regression discontinuity framework. To isolate the causal effect of insurance from any behavioral effects of coverage on the timing of care, we will focus specifically on non-deferrable health events (e.g., heart attacks and stroke).","Health Insurance, Non-Deferrable Health Events and Financial Risk",8582441,R21AG044737,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Attention ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Expenditure ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Household ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Literature ', ' Medicaid ', ' Motivation ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Perception ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Play ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' Stress ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' American ', ' care seeking ', ' Categories ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' retired person ', ' retired people ', ' retiree ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Scheme ', ' Text ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R21,2013,246000,0.07525902185398693
"Universal Health Insurance and the Adequacy and Efficiency of Health Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Universal Health Insurance and the Adequacy and Efficiency of Health Care This project will use comparisons between people just under and just over age 65 to measure how the availability of nearly universal health insurance for those over 65 affects the use of primary care versus Emergency Department services; the quality of health care services provided outside the hospital, and the treatment intensity and health outcomes of people admitted to the hospital for acute myocardial infarction. The results from this project will be directly policy-relevant as they will help to quantify the effects of insurance coverage (or lack of coverage) on the efficiency and efficacy of the health care delivery system for older adults. They will also provide valuable information for evaluating the costs of extending health insurance coverage to previously uncovered individuals. The findings will also provide new insights into the disparities in treatment of acute myocardial infarction patients across different patient groups, and how these disparities affect the health of these groups.        This project will use comparisons between people just over age 65 (nearly all of whom are covered by Medicare) and those just under age 65 (many of whom lack adequate health insurance) to learn how the availability of health insurance affects the use of Emergency Departments for non-urgent care, the rate of hospitalization for ""preventable"" causes, and the types of treatments provided to hospital patients admitted for heart attacks.

"Incidence and Outcomes of Ectopic Pregnancy in the Medicaid Population    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am a family physician with a background of academic excellence, a solid introduction to health services research, and a demonstrated commitment to the well-being of disadvantaged women and children. Goals: In the long term, I aim to help improve reproductive health outcomes and eliminate disparities in maternal and child health. My five-year goal is to identify ectopic pregnancy incidence and outcomes in the Medicaid population and in the process to develop a new, widely-applicable methodology for studying ectopic pregnancy epidemiology. Career Development Plan: In order to accomplish these goals, I need to acquire the knowledge and skills to manage and analyze large administrative data sets. I will do so by taking formal courses in quantitative research methods and health policy, participating in workshops on the use of public insurance data, meeting regularly with mentors and advisors, and presenting my work internally and at national meetings for review. Research Plan: I will conduct secondary analysis of Medicaid Analytic Extract files, measuring ectopic pregnancy incidence, rate, and outcomes. I will then develop a multivariate model to explain individual and state-based variation in ectopic pregnancy. Research Environment: I am supported by a primary mentor with long-standing experience developing junior investigators; a diverse mentorship team of physicians and population scientists with relevant content and methodology expertise; an advisory board of national experts in maternal health epidemiology, Medicaid policy, and health econometrics; and an institution with proven dedication to research excellence.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ectopic pregnancy is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Current knowledge of ectopic pregnancy epidemiology is lacking, especially for low-income women.

"Reducing Health Disparities: A Health IT Solution     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  My Coverage Plan Inc. (MCP) proposes to use our newly patented technology to create a commercially viable and nationally replicable suite of software and services for health care providers and other social service agencies that reduces avoidable health disparities and increases provider reimbursements. The MCP health IT solution will help providers proactively identify coverage options for patients with health disparities and help them maintain coverage by generating an electronic health care coverage record. Many Americans lack adequate health care coverage, a statistic especially true of disparity populations. The lack of insurance coverage harms both patients and providers. Patients risk poor medical outcomes and high debt burdens. And providers who serve these patients seldom receive full reimbursement for the medical care provided. Health care systems typically pass these losses to paying consumers and insurers. MCP proposes to address health disparities by offering a replicable software and service package that allows providers to proactively, accurately, and efficiently identify and secure coverage for disparity patients. The complexity inherent with the implementation of health care reform only heightens the need for improved provider services for patients with disparities. During Phase I, MCP established proof of concept and built a prototype of the benefits eligibility screening software. Building on the success of Phase I research and development, MCP proposes the following three aims for Phase II: 1) Expand MCP's screening capacity to fully locate, rank and record optimal public and or private coverage options for disparity patients across the age and disability spectrum; 2) Test and refine the screening tool for cultural and linguistic competence, maximum accuracy, usability and national replication; 3) Demonstrate the positive impact for disparity patients and measure the cost benefits for providers of MCP's offering in multiple settings. MCP is well prepared to carry out this project. MCP's President, Robert ""Bobby"" Peterson is an attorney and health care financing expert with over 25 years of experience in understanding and navigating complex programs for low-income disparity populations. MCP's parent company, founded by Mr. Peterson, ABC for Health, Inc., has provided health benefits counseling to low-income and minority patients for more than 18 years. Partner, ABC for Health will provide health benefits expertise to inform product development and testing. Other MCP committed partners include urban and rural hospitals and providers that serve disparity populations in Wisconsin.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: My Coverage Plan, Inc., (MCP) proposes a Phase II renewal of ""Reducing Health Disparities: A Health IT Solution"" to further demonstrate our software and service strategy that efficiently identifies public and private health coverage options for patient with health disparities across the age and disability spectrum and increase provider reimbursements. MCP demonstrated in Phase I that our software application promotes the proper coordination and maximization of public and private sources of health care and help reduce avoidable health disparities as patients' secure available coverage and avoid medical-debt and uncompensated care and achieve improved health outcomes.

"The Effects of State and Federal Insurance Policies on Quality of Care for Autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism and other autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are complex developmental disorders characterized by repetitive behavior and delayed social interaction and communication. Autism affects approximately 1 in 110 children, with symptoms occurring as early as 18 months of age and continuing throughout the individual's life. Although there is no consensus about the most effective treatments for ASD, studies have shown early  intervention to enhance cognitive and adaptive functioning and early educational attainment. Who pays for ASD services, however, is often unclear. There are considerable differences in states' approaches to financing ASD services and supporting programs for children with ASD. Many states have implemented Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) waivers under their Medicaid programs, which expand coverage to  children with ASD who might not otherwise qualify for Medicaid or have access to specialized services. There is considerable variation across states, however, in the number of children included and the services offered. In addition, some states have passed legislation requiring private insurers, who traditionally have limited or excluded coverage for individuals with ASD, to cover specific ASD services or to provide coverage at a level on par with other disorders. The challenges in identifying, accessing, navigating and paying for ASD services available in a given community, given the complexity of a child's needs, available services, and these financing arrangements, can place a substantial burden on parents and caregivers of children with ASD. Although previous studies have examined satisfaction with care and the impact of having a child with ASD on parental income and employment, little is known about the effects of state policies regarding coverage and financing of services for children with ASD on these outcomes, or whether these effects differ by race/ethnicity. This study would explore these effects using data from multiple waves of two national surveys of children's health: the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs and the National Survey of Children's Health.  Data from these surveys span the period 2001 through 2011, a time when many states implemented Medicaid waiver programs and passed insurance coverage mandates for ASD. We will examine the effects of these policies on access to care, satisfaction and family burden among children with ASD and their families in both publicly and privately insured populations. We will also explore whether characteristics of the waivers (e.g., eligibility criteria, benefit limits, etc.) or of the mandates (e.g., coverage lmits, whether specific services [such as physical therapy, speech therapy or applied behavioral analysis] must be covered, etc.) are associated with changes in access to care, family burden and satisfaction, and whether these effects differ by race/ethnicity. In addition to informing futue Medicaid HCBS waivers and insurance coverage mandates, the results of the study will be instrumental in implementing the Federal Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act and  health care reform.            The challenges in identifying, accessing, navigating and paying for ASD services available in a given community, given the complexity of a child's needs, available services, and financing arrangements, can place a substantial burden on parents and caregivers of children with ASD.

"A Randomized Trial of Effects of Parent Mentors on Insuring Minority Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  9.6 million US children (13%) have no health insurance, and dramatic racial/ethnic disparities exist in lacking coverage. In contrast to only 7% of white children being uninsured, 20% of Latino and 12% of African- American children are uninsured, and Latino and African-American children account for 57% of uninsured children, although comprising only 37% of all US children. Numerous studies show that being uninsured has a profound negative impact on children's health, healthcare, and mortality. Evidence suggests, however, that insuring uninsured children results in significantly improved health and healthcare. But about 70% of uninsured US children (6 million) are eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), so innovative strategies are needed to insure more children and eliminate disparities. The proposed study would be the first randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of parent mentors (PMs) to traditional Medicaid/CHIP outreach and enrollment in insuring uninsured minority children. The primary study aims are to evaluate whether PMs are more effective and more cost-effective than traditional Medicaid/CHIP outreach and enrollment in insuring eligible, uninsured Latino and African-American children. The secondary aim is to determine whether uninsured children who obtain health insurance experience improvements in healthcare access, health status, use of services, and other health outcomes.  Subjects will be 300 uninsured Latino and African-American children eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP and residing in Dallas County, where 90% of uninsured children (166,013) are Latino or African-American. Subjects will be randomized to PMs or a control group receiving traditional Medicaid/CHIP outreach. PMs are experienced parents who have at least 1 child currently covered by Medicaid/CHIP. PMs will undergo a 2-day intensive training session, and will be paired with intervention subjects and their families, for whom they will provide information on program eligibility, help families complete and submit insurance applications, act as a Medicaid/CHIP liaison, and assist in maintaining coverage. Controls will receive no intervention other than standard Medicaid/CHIP outreach. Primary outcomes will include obtaining health insurance, coverage continuity, the time interval to obtain coverage, parental satisfaction with the process of obtaining insurance, and costs; secondary outcomes will include access to care, health status, use of services, quality of life, quality of care, parental satisfaction, financial burden, and missed school and parental work days. Subjects will be contacted monthly for 1 year to monitor outcomes by a blinded assessor. Achievement of the study aims has the potential to be a significant contribution to reducing racial/ethnic disparities, empowering minority communities, providing economic revitalization through employment of minority parents, and advancing knowledge, practice, and child health policy. If successful, this intervention could serve as a national model for insuring uninsured children and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in insurance coverage.         Having no health insurance coverage has a profoundly negative impact on children's health, healthcare, and mortality, but almost 10 million US children (13%) are uninsured, and dramatic racial/ethnic disparities exist in insurance coverage. The study aims are to evaluate whether Parent Mentors (parents who already have a child covered by Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program [CHIP]) are more effective and more cost-effective than traditional Medicaid/CHIP approaches to insuring eligible, uninsured Latino and African- American children, and to determine whether minority uninsured children who obtain health insurance experience improvements in healthcare access, health status, use of services, and other health outcomes. If successful, this innovative intervention has the potential to have a major impact on reducing racial/ethnic disparities, empowering minority communities, providing economic revitalization through employment of minority parents, and advancing knowledge, practice, and child health policy; this intervention also could serve as a national model for insuring uninsured children and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in childhood insurance coverage.

"Reducing disparities in diabetes through expanded insurance coverage.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): type 2 diabetes causes a disproportionate health burden among racial and ethnic minorities in the United States. At the same time, these minority populations are among those most likely to be uninsured or to experience interruptions in healthcare coverage. Lack of insurance is associated with a greater probability of having undiagnosed diabetes, and with poorer quality of care for patients with diagnosed diabetes. As healthcare reform moves toward implementation following the passage of national legislation, important gaps remain in the understanding of the expected population health effects of expanding insurance coverage, and especially regarding the likely impact on health disparities. With respect to diabetes in particular, there is urgent need for a comprehensive analysis that traces the entire pathway from insurance to reduced morbidity and mortality, and provides a unifying framework for previous observational and quasi- experimental studies. The overall goal of this proposed study is to deploy systematic and rigorous empirical analysis to investigate the potential impact of expanding insurance coverage on health disparities in diabetes, at the national and state level. The project has three specific aims: 1) Quantify the potential impact of expanding insurance coverage among diabetic patients, in terms of  improvements in key modifiable risk factors (e.g. high blood glucose) associated with major  complications of diabetes, by racial and ethnic group. 2) Predict, based on alternative population risk factor distributions reflecting different insurance coverage scenarios, reductions in racial/ethnic disparities in diabetes-related morbidity and mortality attributable to  expanded insurance coverage. 3) Evaluate the validity of the model results by comparing predicted and observed outcomes in Massachusetts following the expansion of insurance coverage through the landmark 2006 health reform. Collectively, the proposed research activities will constitute a coherent, significant and innovative advance in addressing critical gaps in policy-relevant information on diabetes disparities that are amenable to improvements through changes in the healthcare system. This information is essential for identifying key priorities and setting realistic targets for reducing health disparities, and for defining critical benchmarks for evaluating progress towards these objectives as major developments in national healthcare policy evolve.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial and ethnic minorities in the United States bear a disproportionate health burden from diabetes, and are also most likely to lack continuous health insurance. Lack of insurance is associated with a greater chance of having undiagnosed diabetes, and with poorer quality of care for patients with diagnosed diabetes. As healthcare reform moves toward implementation following the passage of national legislation, this project aims to provide a rigorous, systematic and comprehensive examination of the potential impact of expanding insurance coverage on health disparities in diabetes.

"Medicaid Expansion in Oregon:  Access and Health Outcomes for Women and Infants     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early intervention to identify and treat chronic disease and modify behavioral risk factors among women of reproductive age has the potential to significantly reduce their morbidity and mortality and improve their pregnancy outcomes. Lack of health insurance has been a major barrier to early intervention and preventive care among low-income women of reproductive age. However, the 2014 expansion of Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) will make millions of low-income women newly eligible for Medicaid and preventive health services. An integrated data system is essential to evaluate the impact of this expansion on the health of women of reproductive age and their infants. Research using this data system will inform future program planning and identify best practices and areas of greatest need. We propose to create an integrated data system that links Oregon Medicaid data with birth and death certificates and hospital discharge data. Further, we will include data on the quality of Medicaid services that are not available to other states. The proposed study is a collaborative effort between Oregon State University and the Oregon Health Authority. Oregon is an ideal state in which to conduct the proposed study because of its ongoing commitment to Medicaid health care delivery reform and the commitment of state leaders to collaborate across divisions and programs to ensure this project's success. The project also has the support of key state stakeholders in maternal and child health and women's health. The specific aims of the proposal are to1) develop a research agenda, in collaboration with key stakeholders, to evaluate the expansion of Medicaid on the health of Medicaid-eligible women of reproductive age, mothers, and infants in Oregon; 2) link Oregon Medicaid data for female enrollees ages 15-44 and their infants to statewide datasets, including (but not limited to) live birth, fetal death, infant death, and hospital discharge data, beginning with 2008 and continuing until 2016, as data become available; and 3) conduct planned analyses and disseminate findings. The research agenda will include key research questions that assess the effect of Medicaid expansion on Medicaid enrollment and access to care for low-income women; utilization of services by women and infants enrolled in Medicaid; general health behaviors, risks, and outcomes for these women; and pregnancy complications and poor birth outcomes. We will also measure disparities that remain after Medicaid expansion, to inform strategies to mitigate those disparities on an ongoing basis. We will use results of these analyses to construct simulations that extend this study's findings into implications and lessons for policy makers and stakeholders in other states that are expanding Medicaid. Results of these analyses and simulations will provide valuable information to support health reform efforts, both in Oregon and across the U.S, to reduce the public health burden and improve population health among women of reproductive age, including pregnancy and infant health outcomes.                 Project Narrative The collaborative research team will create an integrated, state-level data system that links Medicaid data with other existing data sets. Analyses will be conducted that will provide valuable evidence on the impact of Medicaid expansion in Oregon and across the US. Findings may be used to improve access to health care services and health outcomes among Medicaid-eligible women and their children.",Medicaid Expansion in Oregon:  Access and Health Outcomes for Women and Infants,8722335,U01DP004783,[''],NCCDPHP,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2014,249476,0.1412024080438288

"Disparities in Cancer Screening: The Role of Medicaid Policy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study examines how existing and new policies that affect the generosity of state Medicaid programs impact breast and cervical cancer screening and related health outcomes among low-income women. There are substantial disparities in breast and cervical cancer diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes in the United States by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic and insurance status. Further, resources to improve access to and quality of care for underserved populations are limited. In recent years, the federal government granted many states increased flexibility to cover low-income adults through Medicaid waivers. Further expansions to Medicaid are anticipated under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Current variation in state Medicaid programs and anticipated changes under the ACA provide natural experiments for studying the effect of public insurance on screening for low-income women. We consider the effect of pre- and post-reform variation in eligibility between and within states, as well as the effect of physician payment and patient cost sharing on screening. Understanding how state Medicaid policies affect cancer screening will help guide strategies to reach under-screened populations and add to evidence regarding the costs and benefits of different policies. In addition, we study how variation in Medicaid generosity across states and over time is related to outcomes including cancer incidence and stage at diagnosis, the single most important predictor of survival. The project brings together complementary secondary data from a number of sources. Nationally representative survey data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System will be used to study the effects of Medicaid eligibility on breast and cervical cancer screening among low-income populations. Medicaid administrative claims and utilization data will allow us to consider the effects of changes in eligibility as well as physician payment and patient cost sharing on screening among Medicaid enrollees. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry data will be used to estimate the effects of changes in Medicaid generosity on cancer incidence and stage at diagnosis. Our analytic approach employs a quasi- experimental design to compare changes in outcomes among groups that would have been affected by changes in Medicaid policy (eligibility, payment rates, or cost sharing) to similar groups that were not subject to polcy changes. In addition to considering the effect of policy changes on all low-income women, we will examine whether effects of expansions are larger among racial and ethnic minorities, reducing disparities. This is the first study to consider the effect of recent Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, physician payment, and cost sharing on breast and cervical cancer screening, which are the most important measures for the prevention of breast and cervical cancer morbidity and mortality. The results will provide timely evidence on how Medicaid policy affects women's preventive healthcare utilization and health outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Low-income women are less likely to receive recommended cancer screenings that can lead to earlier detection and treatment that subsequently reduces morbidity and mortality. This project examines how state Medicaid policies impact breast and cervical cancer screening and related health outcomes among low-income women, and results will help guide strategies to reach under-screened populations and add to evidence regarding the costs and benefits of policies related to Medicaid eligibility, physician payment, and benefit design.

"Health Insurance, Non-Deferrable Health Events and Financial Risk Enter the text here that is the new abstract information for your application. This section must be no longer than 30 lines of text. The goal of this study is to estimate the impact of health insurance on financial risk among the young elderly (ages 65-80) relative to the near elderly (ages 50-64). The near elderly are ineligible for Medicare based on age but are more likely than the general population to have serious health conditions and thus be exposed to medical expenditure risk (Williams et al. 2010). While less than 1 percent of the elderly are uninsured, almost 15 percent of the near elderly lacked insurance in 2010 (KFF 2011b). Thus, health insurance has the potential to significantly affect exposure to financial risk for the elderly relative to the near elderly. We will use 15 years (1996-2010) of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), the highest quality nationally representative data containing information on health insurance coverage, health conditions, and total and out-of-pocket medical spending, both overall and by category (e.g. inpatient, outpatient). We will supplement the MEPS analysis with secondary data on medical- related financial stress from the Health Tracking Household Survey (HTHS) and unique primary data collected on the actual and perceived financial risk associated with health spending from the RAND American Life Panel (ALP). Using these data this exploratory project will address the following aims: (1) Estimate the relationship between health insurance and actual and perceived financial risk in an regression discontinuity framework, exploiting the discontinuity in Medicare coverage at age 65. (2) Investigate heterogeneity in the impact of Medicare on both actual and perceived financial risk across education and race/ethnicity groups as well as its impact on disparities in financial risk. (3) Estimate the welfare change from Medicare-related changes in risk exposure in an expected utility framework and compare this change to the social cost of the program. Financial risk protection is the primary motivation behind any insurance scheme. At older ages, health insurance can safeguard consumption, playing a potentially significant role in protecting the well-being of the elderly. This work aims to estimate the impact of health insurance on actual and perceived medical expenditure risk among the young elderly (ages 65-80) relative to near (50-64) elderly. We will analyze both high quality secondary data on actual spending and unique primary data on perceived risk in a regression discontinuity framework. To isolate the causal effect of insurance from any behavioral effects of coverage on the timing of care, we will focus specifically on non-deferrable health events (e.g., heart attacks and stroke).","Health Insurance, Non-Deferrable Health Events and Financial Risk",8730077,R21AG044737,"['abstracting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Attention ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Expenditure ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Household ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Literature ', ' Medicaid ', ' Motivation ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Perception ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Play ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' Stress ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Exposure to ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' American ', ' care seeking ', ' Categories ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' retired person ', ' retired people ', ' retiree ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Scheme ', ' Text ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R21,2014,227980,0.07525902185398693
"Effectiveness of a prison system-based Medicaid enrollment program     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Addressing the health of incarcerated populations is a necessary step in reducing U.S. health disparities. Many of the same socioeconomic, behavioral, and community-level risk factors that place one at risk for imprisonment also are associated with risk for poor health. Accordingly, former prisoners have a disproportionately high prevalence of chronic and disabling health conditions and, unsurprisingly, suffer excessively high rates of all-cause mortality. With 700,000 prisoners released annually, the health of these individuals has a pervasive effect on the health of the communities and families to which they return. The transition from prison back to the community is particularly difficult an is considerably more challenging for those with severe and chronic health conditions, most of whom have no health insurance. Medicaid is an important source of health care coverage for the impoverished and among low-income populations and has been shown to increase use of routine healthcare and improve self-reported health outcomes. While released prisoners with severe and chronic health conditions may be eligible for Medicaid, enrollment depends on their successful navigation of an application process that is both difficult and time consuming; as a result, enrollment is relatively uncommon. Nearly all state prison systems have interpreted federal Medicaid policies as mandating the termination of Medicaid benefits upon incarceration and prohibiting Medicaid enrollment during incarceration, thus creating additional barriers to Medicaid enrollment. In recent years, however, top federal Medicaid administrators have clarified that prisoners may enroll in Medicaid during incarceration, albeit only to pay for inpatient healthcare provided outside of the prison system (e.g., a community hospital). In response to this clarification, about 1/3 of state prison systems have created programs to facilitate prisoner enrollment into Medicaid. Importantly, prisoners enrolled in Medicaid during their incarceration can resume their Medicaid coverage immediately upon reentering the community. Therefore, prison-based Medicaid enrollment assistance programs (PBMEAPs) may play a pivotal role in prisoners' post-release access to health services and, consequently, their health. Moreover, in North Carolina (NC) and the 24 other Medicaid non-expansion states, PBMEAPs will be one of the best opportunities for prison-involved persons with chronic health conditions to enroll in Medicaid. Despite the potential impact of these programs, even basic evaluations of PBMEAPs have yet to be conducted. In this application, we have proposed a mixed methods approach to examine the effectiveness and the cost implications of the PBMEAP in the NC prison system. We will examine prisoners' rate of Medicaid enrollment, their post-release outcomes, and their attitudes about healthcare access. We will also examine the program's cost-savings for the prison system and factors that affect program performance. Our findings will provide state policy makers, prison officials, and Medicaid administrators with a data-driven understanding of the program's effectiveness and its impact on healthcare access and health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prison-based Medicaid enrollment assistance programs (PBMEAPs) have the potential to improve access to healthcare for prisoners upon their release. Our evaluation of the NC prison system's PBMEAP will provide policy-makers, prison officials, and Medicaid administrators in NC and other states with a data-driven understanding of the impact of this program on healthcare access and health, and will help prison administrators evaluate and improve their program. If found to be effective, adoption of PBMEAPs among other state prison systems could have a profound effect on diminishing health disparities experienced by released prisoners, one of the most underserved segments of US society                ",Effectiveness of a prison system-based Medicaid enrollment program,8774029,R01MD008979,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non-A non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non A non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis nonA nonB ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' PT-NANBH ', ' Non-B Hepatitis Parenterally-Transmitted Non-A ', ' NANBH ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Inpatients ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' North Carolina ', ' Play ', ' jail inmate ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' Prisoner ', ' Prisons ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Savings ', ' Societies ', ' Substance Dependence ', ' Substance Addiction ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Time ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Administrator ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Improve Access ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2014,380000,0.19957794272468604
"Community-based HIT Tools for Cancer Screening and Health Insurance Promotion     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer morbidity and mortality risks can be greatly reduced through screening and prevention. Patients without health insurance are much less likely to receive evidence-based cancer screenings and preventive care. Interventions that optimize and stabilize health insurance coverage could substantially increase rates of receipt of timely cancer preventive care. As many patients with unstable coverage receive care at Community Health Centers (CHCs), CHCs are well-positioned to provide such interventions. Recent advances in CHCs' health information technology (HIT) create new opportunities for using automated processes and data to support insurance outreach efforts. We propose to conduct a clinic-level cluster randomized trial in 12 CHCs (~47,000 patients aged 18-64) to test the effectiveness of Community-based HIT Tools for Cancer Screening and Health Insurance Promotion (""CATCH-UP"" tools) at improving rates of (1) cancer screening and prevention services, and (2) health insurance coverage. The CATCH-UP tools are designed to identify and reach uninsured CHC patients who are eligible for enrollment in public insurance coverage, and to encourage re-enrollment of publicly-insured patients before coverage gaps occur. Modeled after HIT tools proven effective for chronic disease management, the CATCH-UP tools include a panel management / data aggregator system coupled with automated patient outreach and communication. We will partner with OCHIN, a non-profit community HIT network that hosts one of the nation's largest CHC electronic health record platforms.  We hypothesize that patients of CHCs that have these tools will have higher rates of continuous insurance coverage, and as a result, higher rates of up-to-date age- and gender-appropriate cancer screening and prevention services, compared to patients of CHCs without such tools. Our aims are as follows. Aim 1: Evaluate the effect of the CATCH-UP intervention on up-to-date status of cancer screening and preventive care received by patients. We will assess gender- and age-appropriate rates of screening and assessment (colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, smoking, obesity); immunization (human papillomavirus vaccination); and counseling (smoking, weight). Aim 2: Evaluate the effect of the CATCH-UP intervention on patients' insurance coverage rates. To accomplish Aims 1 and 2, we will conduct clinic- and patient-level difference-in-differences quantitative analyses to compare pre- and post-intervention changes between control and intervention groups. Aim 3: Evaluate the intervention implementation process, patient and CHC staff acceptance and use of the CATCH-UP tools, and the patient-, provider-, and system-level factors associated with successful implementation and sustainability of the tools, using mixed methods.

"Center for Health Insurance Reform, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the central policy assumptions in the U.S. today is that expanding health insurance coverage will improve access to health care, improve health outcomes, and make each more equitable for all Americans. Indeed, lack of health insurance is associated with less use of cardiovascular (CV) and other care, poor health outcomes, and increased mortality. Limited access to care is one of strongest contributors to disparities in outcomes. Massachusetts (MA) is the site of a key policy-relevant natural experiment, whereby recent legislation has resulted in 97% of the state's residents obtaining health insurance; it is thus the ideal setting in which to monitor and evaluate CV health outcomes, and disparities in such outcomes. We propose to develop the ""Center for Health Insurance Reform, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Disparities"" at Boston University School of Medicine and Boston Medical Center, New England's largest safety net hospital. We will examine the effects of MA health reform on CV care and outcomes, and in disparities in each, through two studies. The first will evaluate whether expanded insurance coverage will be associated with fewer preventable inpatient admissions for ambulatory care sensitive CV conditions and readmissions for CV conditions. This project will also assess rates of referral-sensitive cardiac procedures, and the use of safety-net hospitals by racial/ethnic minority patients. The second project will examine care and outcomes of   care for venous thromboembolism (VTE) both pre- and post-reform, examining whether increased access to primary and home care, and to outpatient pharmacy services, will be associated with better clinical outcomes, as well as improved health related quality of life, survival and cost-effectiveness. The specific aims of our Center are: 1) To conduct research to evaluate the effects of health reform in MA on CV outcomes; 2) To complement and collaborate with other existing centers in CV outcomes research. 3) To develop three Early Stage Investigators into seasoned CV outcomes researchers who are well versed in the issues, topics and methods in the field, and who, upon the completion of the center activities, will be poised to make substantial future contributions to the field of CV outcomes research.             ","Center for Health Insurance Reform, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Disparities",8653603,U01HL105342,"['Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Boston ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Northeastern United States ', ' New England ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy Services ', ' Pharmaceutic Services ', ' Pharmaceutical Services ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Seasons ', ' Thromboembolism ', ' Universities ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' patient homecare ', ' Home Care ', ' patient home care ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Policies ', ' Staging ', ' Venous ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Improve Access ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' safety net ', ' ']",NHLBI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2014,1887108,0.09153129458516222
"Center of Excellence on Quality of Care Measures for Children with Complex Needs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Research and policy related to children has focused on expanding eligibility for public insurance programs, but expanding access to a system that does not deliver necessary services will not result in optimal outcomes. Deficits in care delivery must be identified if appropriate strategies to close the gaps are to be developed and implemented. Title IV of the Child Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) called for the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to identify and post for public comment an initial, recommended core set of children's health care quality measures for voluntary use by Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Programs (CHIP). While this initial core set of measures represents a good starting place, it is just the first step in a long term process to develop a rigorous, standardized set of measures that will facilitate routine quality assessment and guidance on priorities for improving children's healthcare quality. Several deficits were identified during the selection of the initial core set of measures mandated by the CHIPRA legislation. These included a dearth of measures for particular types of care and care settings as well as an inability to adequately collect data on race, ethnicity, and special health care need status to monitor variations in care and disparities. Additionally, no quality measures were identified that assess ""most integrated health care settings."" For this project we have assembled a Center of Excellence on Quality of Care Measures for Children with Complex Needs (COE4CCN). The COE4CCN brings together a diverse and talented group of organizations and individuals who have the expertise and capacity to rigorously develop and test quality measures that address all of the above mentioned areas of deficit. The COE4CCN includes experts in the areas of survey measure development, evidence-based process measure development using medical records and/or administrative data, risk adjustment, assessing disparities, and appropriately identifying and stratifying children with special health care needs into meaningful risk categories. Additionally, the COE4CCN brings together content experts in several key areas including the medical home, caring for CSHCN, child and adolescent mental and behavioral health, chronic disease management in adolescents, racial/ethnic disparities, and health informatics. Several key stakeholder groups will also be integral members of the COE4CCN, including representatives from Medicaid and CHIP programs in two states (WA and MN), representatives from the AAP Chapters in WA and MN, and representatives from MN Family Voices. The COE4CCN will have the ability to develop meaningful, rigorously designed, disseminable quality measures that can be used at the national level to both track and improve on the quality of care provided to US children.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The quality of care measures we propose to develop under this award will provide new tools to rigorously and comprehensively evaluate health care for children with complex needs. Without such measurement tools, it is not possible to assess where deficits exist and how to target efforts to best improve care. These measures will be designed for dissemination and use among all Medicaid and Child Health Insurance Programs (CHIP) nationally.

"Insurance Instability and Disparities in Chronic Disease Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial and ethnic health disparities in the processes and outcomes of chronic disease care are pervasive, well documented, and consistently linked to health insurance coverage. Insurance instability (the frequency of switches in insurance coverage or gaps without coverage), may contribute to disparities in outcomes of chronic disease care. With the explicit goal of reducing disparities, Massachusetts (MA) Health Insurance Reform has now extended comprehensive health insurance coverage to 98% of the state's residents, with disproportionately greater gains in coverage among racial/ethnic minorities and the poor. To examine if MA insurance reform has lessened health disparities through increased insurance stability, our specific aims are: Aim 1: To examine changes in insurance instability pre- and post-reform, overall and comparing racial/ethnic specific minority populations to whites. We hypothesize that (a) Insurance instability decreased in the post-reform period and (c) Insurance instability decreased more for racial/ethnic minorities. Aim 2: To examine whether patients receiving care post-insurance reform had better processes of chronic disease management and improved health outcomes, compared with patients receiving care pre-insurance reform, and whether such patterns vary by race/ethnicity. We hypothesize that improvements in processes and outcomes of chronic disease management were greater among racial/ethnic minorities who benefited the most from insurance reform, resulting in reduced disparities. Aim 3: To assess whether patients with more favorable insurance stability had better processes of chronic disease care and improved health outcomes compared to patients with less favorable insurance stability, and whether racial/ethnic minority patients experienced disproportionately greater gains. We hypothesize that greater insurance stability will be associated with improved processes and outcomes of chronic disease management, resulting in reduced disparities. We will conduct an innovative study to assess the processes and outcomes of care for six highly prevalent, chronic conditions before and after the implementation of MA Health Insurance Reform. These conditions are diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We will utilize existing electronic medical records on over 110,000 subjects from Boston Medical Center and eight of its affiliated federally qualified Community Health Centers, the largest safety net institution in New England that serves African American and Hispanic communities, and Tufts Medical Center, which serves a large Asian American community in Boston's Chinatown. When the study is completed, we will provide empiric data on the direct impact of insurance reform and insurance instability on health disparities in multiple populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We seek to determine the effectiveness of Massachusetts Health Insurance Reform on reducing disparities in processes and outcomes of chronic conditions among Boston's vulnerable populations. We will analyze the impact of insurance reform and insurance coverage stability on the care of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients who receive care at Tufts Medical Center and Boston Medical Center and its affiliated health centers for six conditions: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, congestive heart failure, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

"The Effects of Accountable Care Organizations on Health Care Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) are being pursued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as a means to rein in health care cost growth while improving quality of care, but little is known about how ACO efforts to improve health care efficiency might affect health care equity. In this context, the candidate (Dr. Valerie A. Lewis) seeks to understand how ACOs affect racial and socioeconomic disparities in health care outcomes. The candidate, a sociologist and health services researcher at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, will leverage this application to develop her research agenda and develop into an independent investigator. During the period of support, she will pursue didactic instruction in several disciplines, including training in clinical conditions and organizational behavior along with leadership development. She will also have ample opportunity for mentored, project-based learning, including developing advanced understanding of how to measure quality of care. The proposed research plan has three aims: Aim 1. To examine Medicare ACO coverage across patient race and socioeconomic status. Dr. Lewis will use Medicare claims data to examine whether disadvantaged patients are more or less likely than other patients to receive care from ACO providers compared to non-ACO providers and will examine the relative effects of (a) patterns of provider participation in ACOs and (b) patient selection. She will then use the National Survey of ACOs to determine if disadvantaged ACO patients are cared for at ACOs that are systematically different from other ACOs (e.g., types of ACO providers or services, ACO capabilities). Aim 2. To examine how Medicare ACO programs impact disparities in patient care outcomes. Dr. Lewis will use longitudinal Medicare claims data to examine how Medicare ACO programs affect disparities in quality outcomes over time. Analysis will focus on the extent to which changes in disparities are a result of differences withi providers (e.g., all ACO providers improve care for disadvantaged groups) or across providers (e.g., providers serving disadvantaged patients make rapid improvements under ACO programs). Aim 3. To understand how organizational characteristics, capabilities, and strategies influence changing disparities over time under Medicare ACO programs. Dr. Lewis will examine how and why organizational characteristics and capabilities influence changing disparities under ACO models. She will use data from the National Survey of ACOs to explore how ACOs' organizational characteristics (e.g., partnership structure, governance, capabilities) and implementation strategy (e.g., care management programs, physician feedback mechanisms) affect changes in disparities over time. Finally, she will follow up with in-depth interviews to understand how organizational characteristics may be detrimental or beneficial to changing disparities in care. Findings from this project will inform policymakers and implementers about how the ACO model can best facilitate improved health care equity alongside important goals of increased efficiency.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) hold the promise of reducing health care costs while improving quality, but little is known about how these initiatives may affect disparities in health care outcomes by race or socioeconomic status. The proposed project uses Medicare claims, the National Survey of ACOs, and qualitative interviews to examine (1) evenness of Medicare ACO coverage; (2) ACO effects on disparities in quality of care delivered; and (3) ACO characteristics, capabilities, and strategies associated with changing disparities in outcomes.            ",The Effects of Accountable Care Organizations on Health Care Disparities,8868320,K01AG049914,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Patient Dumping ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' sociologist ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Patient Selection ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' payment ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Provider ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' beneficiary ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' public health relevance ', ' Medicare claim ', ' ']",NIA,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,K01,2015,130140,0.07926154632189455

"Medicaid Expansion in Oregon:  Access and Health Outcomes for Women and Infants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early intervention to identify and treat chronic disease and modify behavioral risk factors among women of reproductive age has the potential to significantly reduce their morbidity and mortality and improve their pregnancy outcomes. Lack of health insurance has been a major barrier to early intervention and preventive care among low-income women of reproductive age. However, the 2014 expansion of Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) will make millions of low-income women newly eligible for Medicaid and preventive health services. An integrated data system is essential to evaluate the impact of this expansion on the health of women of reproductive age and their infants. Research using this data system will inform future program planning and identify best practices and areas of greatest need. We propose to create an integrated data system that links Oregon Medicaid data with birth and death certificates and hospital discharge data. Further, we will include data on the quality of Medicaid services that are not available to other states. The proposed study is a collaborative effort between Oregon State University and the Oregon Health Authority. Oregon is an ideal state in which to conduct the proposed study because of its ongoing commitment to Medicaid health care delivery reform and the commitment of state leaders to collaborate across divisions and programs to ensure this project's success. The project also has the support of key state stakeholders in maternal and child health and women's health. The specific aims of the proposal are to1) develop a research agenda, in collaboration with key stakeholders, to evaluate the expansion of Medicaid on the health of Medicaid-eligible women of reproductive age, mothers, and infants in Oregon; 2) link Oregon Medicaid data for female enrollees ages 15-44 and their infants to statewide datasets, including (but not limited to) live birth, fetal death, infant death, and hospital discharge data, beginning with 2008 and continuing until 2016, as data become available; and 3) conduct planned analyses and disseminate findings. The research agenda will include key research questions that assess the effect of Medicaid expansion on Medicaid enrollment and access to care for low-income women; utilization of services by women and infants enrolled in Medicaid; general health behaviors, risks, and outcomes for these women; and pregnancy complications and poor birth outcomes. We will also measure disparities that remain after Medicaid expansion, to inform strategies to mitigate those disparities on an ongoing basis. We will use results of these analyses to construct simulations that extend this study's findings into implications and lessons for policy makers and stakeholders in other states that are expanding Medicaid. Results of these analyses and simulations will provide valuable information to support health reform efforts, both in Oregon and across the U.S, to reduce the public health burden and improve population health among women of reproductive age, including pregnancy and infant health outcomes. Project Narrative The collaborative research team will create an integrated, state-level data system that links Medicaid data with other existing data sets. Analyses will be conducted that will provide valuable evidence on the impact of Medicaid expansion in Oregon and across the US. Findings may be used to improve access to health care services and health outcomes among Medicaid-eligible women and their children.",Medicaid Expansion in Oregon:  Access and Health Outcomes for Women and Infants,8994049,U01DP004783,[''],NCCDPHP,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,62368,0.1412024080438288
"Epidemiology, Exploration and Evaluation: Addressing potentially dangerous medications in Medicaid children with a mental health diagnosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental health diagnoses are common in pediatric practice. Abundant evidence demonstrates that many medications used to treat children with mental health conditions are prescribed in circumstances or combinations for which they are not recommended. Such use may lead to patient harms such as onset of diabetes or suicidal ideation, and potentially avoidable emergency department visits and hospitalizations. This project proposes (1) to describe in detail the epidemiology of patient safety in ambulatory care settings, focusing on medication safety in children with mental health diagnoses who are enrolled in New York State Medicaid ; (2) to assess the extent to which three strategies: a) receipt of primary care in a National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)-recognized patient-centered medical home (PCMH); b) a new state policy (""carve-in"") that assigns responsibility to manage the prescription pharmaceutical insurance benefit to managed care plans rather than the state Medicaid program; and c) a more patient-centered, comprehensive set of medication reconciliation (med rec) practices can reduce potentially dangerous medication use or undesirable consequences / patient harms in this populations; and (3) to assess whether or not a state Department of Health quality department's implementation of a survey to assess medication reconciliation in practices throughout Medicaid is an effective way to enhance the performance of such practices. The epidemiological study will use cross sectional, univariate, bivariate, and multivariable analyses for each year from 2014 to 2017, including logistic regression and regression risk analysis. It will look at clinical, patient, contextual, and practice characteristics that are associated with lower and higher uses of potentially dangerous medication practices and undesirable outcomes. It will describe identified disparities, considering characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity, rural/urban residence, foster care status, and level of poverty in the home county. A propensity score analysis will help to assess the association of the specified medication practices with undesirable outcomes and patient harm. Assessment of the PCMH and med rec strategies will utilize propensity score analyses that are modified from the models developed during the epidemiological analysis. The state carve-in policy, implemented in late 2011, will be assessed using a segmented regression analysis of an interrupted time series from 2008 to 2016.=Medication reconciliation practice will be assessed using a survey instrument developed by an AHRQ- CMS CHIPRA Center of Excellence in the federal Pediatric Quality Measures Program. The impact of measurement on med rec practices will be assessed using a cluster randomized trial with a stepped wedge design, surveying one third of practices in all years, on third in years two and three and one thir in year three only. This project promises to provide more detailed insight both into an important patient safety risk in ambulatory settings for a vulnerable population and also into how well several strategies reduce risk in real world settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal addresses several key public health concerns: the safe and unsafe use of medication in children who are in Medicaid who have been diagnosed with at least one mental health condition; the impact of clinical and policy approaches that have been suggested as possibly making care safer through improved medication practices; and the description of both the current state and the evolution over the course of the grant of medication reconciliation practices by clinical practices. Medication reconciliation is a series of policies and practices that are intended to make medication use safer by enhancing coordination between patients/families, and the variety of clinicians who are taking care of them. Our multidisciplinary team will describe the detailed epidemiology of potentially unsafe medication practices and undesirable outcomes for these children in New York State Medicaid; assess the impact of the patient-centered medical home, of medication reconciliation practices and of a statewide policy change that assigns responsibility of the management of drug insurance benefits to managed care vendors; and will look at whether or not monitoring practices for medication reconciliation practices increases the performance of desirable practices.            ","Epidemiology, Exploration and Evaluation: Addressing potentially dangerous medications in Medicaid children with a mental health diagnosis",9060092,R01HS024433,[''],AHRQ,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,497355,0.04657532887021482
"Effect of School-Based Health Centers on Reducing Students Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in 5 persons in poverty is a child <18 years, and this number is growing, especially in the South. Further, 40% of African American and 34% of Hispanic children <18 years live in low-income households, and 55% of poor rural African-American children have less access to health services. Since a majority of public school students are from low-income families in both the South and West, public schools present an opportunity to reach underserved populations on-site with quality healthcare services. For > 2 decades model School-based Health Centers (SBHCs) have been tested to meet health needs of disparity population, but less than 1% of public elementary schools house SBHCs. Four issues must be addressed in taking SBHCs to scale: sustainability, evidence of community need and support, evidence of health and health cost impact, and fidelity to exemplar models. The ongoing Georgia SBHC Project provides operational solutions to the first two issues. The goal of the proposed study, EPOCH (Evaluating Processes and Outcomes for Children), will take advantage of an opportunity to conduct a ""natural experiment"" that will assess the ability of this approach to solve the other two issues. We will examine the effects of expanding SBHCs across three public elementary school sites in Georgia that differ by environment (rural, small city, and suburban) and race / ethnicity (one each being predominantly African American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white children). A specific focus will be the effects of SBHCs on improved access to primary care and, in turn, on the level of health outcomes including obesity, uncontrolled asthma, and Emergency Department and hospital utilization and costs to the Medicaid program. We will conduct a year-by-year comparison of health indicators and health care costs for children with and without access to SBHCs. In a novel approach to evaluating SBHCs, we will conduct a full-scale process and outcome evaluation, following the Implementation Fidelity model proposed by Carroll, et al., and modified by Hasson. This will include active monitoring to measure program adaptations, secondary analysis of SBHCs' benchmarking, schools' routine FitnessGrams and absenteeism statistics, and by linking children enrolled in an SBHC to their Medicaid claims records. This quasi-experimental, longitudinal study will include 7 years' data (3 pre-, 1 during, and 3 post-SBHC implementation) for the 3 SBHC schools and 3 similar, non-SBHC schools. Additionally, Medicaid data will be extracted for children living in the 6 schools' zip codes to conduct utilization and cost analyses on improving specific health outcomes (e.g., asthma and obesity) and reducing health disparities in rural and minority populations. The EPOCH study offers an opportunity to create a new evidence base for the role of SBHCs in states without the Medicaid expansion. Comprehensive SBHCs may have greater importance there because of the lack of alternatives for children to access free or subsidized health care. These findings will also inform the nation as it considers reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in 2015. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal for the proposed research is to evaluate the effectiveness of school-based health centers (SBHCs) in reducing disparities in obesity and asthma and improving school attendance in the low income child populations of the southeast. We can also measure health costs benefits to Medicaid during the first years of the Affordable Care Act. Taking advantage of a natural experiment in Georgia, this study addresses the critical need to test translation of an exemplar program across urban and rural schools for low income and minority students.",Effect of School-Based Health Centers on Reducing Students Health Disparities,8885887,R01MD008966,"['Absenteeism ', ' Age ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Housing ', ' Health Insurance ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Medicaid ', ' Persons ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Solutions ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Rural ', ' satisfaction ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' elementary school ', ' hospital utilization ', ' success ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' Sentinel ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Natural experiment ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ']",NIMHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,390000,0.01692274845356777
"Disparities in Cancer Screening: The Role of Medicaid Policy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study examines how existing and new policies that affect the generosity of state Medicaid programs impact breast and cervical cancer screening and related health outcomes among low-income women. There are substantial disparities in breast and cervical cancer diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes in the United States by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic and insurance status. Further, resources to improve access to and quality of care for underserved populations are limited. In recent years, the federal government granted many states increased flexibility to cover low-income adults through Medicaid waivers. Further expansions to Medicaid are anticipated under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Current variation in state Medicaid programs and anticipated changes under the ACA provide natural experiments for studying the effect of public insurance on screening for low-income women. We consider the effect of pre- and post-reform variation in eligibility between and within states, as well as the effect of physician payment and patient cost sharing on screening. Understanding how state Medicaid policies affect cancer screening will help guide strategies to reach under-screened populations and add to evidence regarding the costs and benefits of different policies. In addition, we study how variation in Medicaid generosity across states and over time is related to outcomes including cancer incidence and stage at diagnosis, the single most important predictor of survival. The project brings together complementary secondary data from a number of sources. Nationally representative survey data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System will be used to study the effects of Medicaid eligibility on breast and cervical cancer screening among low-income populations. Medicaid administrative claims and utilization data will allow us to consider the effects of changes in eligibility as well as physician payment and patient cost sharing on screening among Medicaid enrollees. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry data will be used to estimate the effects of changes in Medicaid generosity on cancer incidence and stage at diagnosis. Our analytic approach employs a quasi- experimental design to compare changes in outcomes among groups that would have been affected by changes in Medicaid policy (eligibility, payment rates, or cost sharing) to similar groups that were not subject to polcy changes. In addition to considering the effect of policy changes on all low-income women, we will examine whether effects of expansions are larger among racial and ethnic minorities, reducing disparities. This is the first study to consider the effect of recent Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, physician payment, and cost sharing on breast and cervical cancer screening, which are the most important measures for the prevention of breast and cervical cancer morbidity and mortality. The results will provide timely evidence on how Medicaid policy affects women's preventive healthcare utilization and health outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Low-income women are less likely to receive recommended cancer screenings that can lead to earlier detection and treatment that subsequently reduces morbidity and mortality. This project examines how state Medicaid policies impact breast and cervical cancer screening and related health outcomes among low-income women, and results will help guide strategies to reach under-screened populations and add to evidence regarding the costs and benefits of policies related to Medicaid eligibility, physician payment, and benefit design.

The specific aims of the proposal are to1) develop a research agenda, in collaboration with key stakeholders, to evaluate the expansion of Medicaid on the health of Medicaid-eligible women of reproductive age, mothers, and infants in Oregon; 2) link Oregon Medicaid data for female enrollees ages 15-44 and their infants to statewide datasets, including (but not limited to) live birth, fetal death, infant death, and hospital discharge data, beginning with 2008 and continuing until 2016, as data become available; and 3) conduct planned analyses and disseminate findings. The research agenda will include key research questions that assess the effect of Medicaid expansion on Medicaid enrollment and access to care for low-income women; utilization of services by women and infants enrolled in Medicaid; general health behaviors, risks, and outcomes for these women; and pregnancy complications and poor birth outcomes. We will also measure disparities that remain after Medicaid expansion, to inform strategies to mitigate those disparities on an ongoing basis. We will use results of these analyses to construct simulations that extend this study's findings into implications and lessons for policy makers and stakeholders in other states that are expanding Medicaid. Results of these analyses and simulations will provide valuable information to support health reform efforts, both in Oregon and across the U.S, to reduce the public health burden and improve population health among women of reproductive age, including pregnancy and infant health outcomes.                 Project Narrative The collaborative research team will create an integrated, state-level data system that links Medicaid data with other existing data sets. Analyses will be conducted that will provide valuable evidence on the impact of Medicaid expansion in Oregon and across the US. Findings may be used to improve access to health care services and health outcomes among Medicaid-eligible women and their children.",Medicaid Expansion in Oregon:  Access and Health Outcomes for Women and Infants,8893787,U01DP004783,[''],NCCDPHP,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,333770,0.1412024080438288
"Effectiveness of a prison system-based Medicaid enrollment program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Addressing the health of incarcerated populations is a necessary step in reducing U.S. health disparities. Many of the same socioeconomic, behavioral, and community-level risk factors that place one at risk for imprisonment also are associated with risk for poor health. Accordingly, former prisoners have a disproportionately high prevalence of chronic and disabling health conditions and, unsurprisingly, suffer excessively high rates of all-cause mortality. With 700,000 prisoners released annually, the health of these individuals has a pervasive effect on the health of the communities and families to which they return. The transition from prison back to the community is particularly difficult an is considerably more challenging for those with severe and chronic health conditions, most of whom have no health insurance. Medicaid is an important source of health care coverage for the impoverished and among low-income populations and has been shown to increase use of routine healthcare and improve self-reported health outcomes. While released prisoners with severe and chronic health conditions may be eligible for Medicaid, enrollment depends on their successful navigation of an application process that is both difficult and time consuming; as a result, enrollment is relatively uncommon. Nearly all state prison systems have interpreted federal Medicaid policies as mandating the termination of Medicaid benefits upon incarceration and prohibiting Medicaid enrollment during incarceration, thus creating additional barriers to Medicaid enrollment. In recent years, however, top federal Medicaid administrators have clarified that prisoners may enroll in Medicaid during incarceration, albeit only to pay for inpatient healthcare provided outside of the prison system (e.g., a community hospital). In response to this clarification, about 1/3 of state prison systems have created programs to facilitate prisoner enrollment into Medicaid. Importantly, prisoners enrolled in Medicaid during their incarceration can resume their Medicaid coverage immediately upon reentering the community. Therefore, prison-based Medicaid enrollment assistance programs (PBMEAPs) may play a pivotal role in prisoners' post-release access to health services and, consequently, their health. Moreover, in North Carolina (NC) and the 24 other Medicaid non-expansion states, PBMEAPs will be one of the best opportunities for prison-involved persons with chronic health conditions to enroll in Medicaid. Despite the potential impact of these programs, even basic evaluations of PBMEAPs have yet to be conducted. In this application, we have proposed a mixed methods approach to examine the effectiveness and the cost implications of the PBMEAP in the NC prison system. We will examine prisoners' rate of Medicaid enrollment, their post-release outcomes, and their attitudes about healthcare access. We will also examine the program's cost-savings for the prison system and factors that affect program performance. Our findings will provide state policy makers, prison officials, and Medicaid administrators with a data-driven understanding of the program's effectiveness and its impact on healthcare access and health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prison-based Medicaid enrollment assistance programs (PBMEAPs) have the potential to improve access to healthcare for prisoners upon their release. Our evaluation of the NC prison system's PBMEAP will provide policy-makers, prison officials, and Medicaid administrators in NC and other states with a data-driven understanding of the impact of this program on healthcare access and health, and will help prison administrators evaluate and improve their program. If found to be effective, adoption of PBMEAPs among other state prison systems could have a profound effect on diminishing health disparities experienced by released prisoners, one of the most underserved segments of US society",Effectiveness of a prison system-based Medicaid enrollment program,8890211,R01MD008979,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non-A non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non A non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis nonA nonB ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' PT-NANBH ', ' Non-B Hepatitis Parenterally-Transmitted Non-A ', ' NANBH ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Inpatients ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' North Carolina ', ' Play ', ' jail inmate ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' Prisoner ', ' Prisons ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Savings ', ' Societies ', ' Substance Dependence ', ' Substance Addiction ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Time ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Administrator ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Improve Access ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2015,380000,0.19957794272468604
"Reducing Health Disparities: A Health IT Solution     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  My Coverage Plan Inc. (MCP) proposes to use our newly patented technology to create a commercially viable and nationally replicable suite of software and services for health care providers and other social service agencies that reduces avoidable health disparities and increases provider reimbursements. The MCP health IT solution will help providers proactively identify coverage options for patients with health disparities and help them maintain coverage by generating an electronic health care coverage record. Many Americans lack adequate health care coverage, a statistic especially true of disparity populations. The lack of insurance coverage harms both patients and providers. Patients risk poor medical outcomes and high debt burdens. And providers who serve these patients seldom receive full reimbursement for the medical care provided. Health care systems typically pass these losses to paying consumers and insurers. MCP proposes to address health disparities by offering a replicable software and service package that allows providers to proactively, accurately, and efficiently identify and secure coverage for disparity patients. The complexity inherent with the implementation of health care reform only heightens the need for improved provider services for patients with disparities. During Phase I, MCP established proof of concept and built a prototype of the benefits eligibility screening software. Building on the success of Phase I research and development, MCP proposes the following three aims for Phase II: 1) Expand MCP's screening capacity to fully locate, rank and record optimal public and or private coverage options for disparity patients across the age and disability spectrum; 2) Test and refine the screening tool for cultural and linguistic competence, maximum accuracy, usability and national replication; 3) Demonstrate the positive impact for disparity patients and measure the cost benefits for providers of MCP's offering in multiple settings. MCP is well prepared to carry out this project. MCP's President, Robert ""Bobby"" Peterson is an attorney and health care financing expert with over 25 years of experience in understanding and navigating complex programs for low-income disparity populations. MCP's parent company, founded by Mr. Peterson, ABC for Health, Inc., has provided health benefits counseling to low-income and minority patients for more than 18 years. Partner, ABC for Health will provide health benefits expertise to inform product development and testing. Other MCP committed partners include urban and rural hospitals and providers that serve disparity populations in Wisconsin.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: My Coverage Plan, Inc., (MCP) proposes a Phase II renewal of ""Reducing Health Disparities: A Health IT Solution"" to further demonstrate our software and service strategy that efficiently identifies public and private health coverage options for patient with health disparities across the age and disability spectrum and increase provider reimbursements. MCP demonstrated in Phase I that our software application promotes the proper coordination and maximization of public and private sources of health care and help reduce avoidable health disparities as patients' secure available coverage and avoid medical-debt and uncompensated care and achieve improved health outcomes.

"Finding Equitable and Effective MTM Eligibility Criteria ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need to improve the Medicare eligibility criteria for medication therapy management (MTM) services in prescription drug (Part D) benefits has been highlighted recently when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released their proposed 2015 rules for Part D plans. In this document, CMS credited our team's series of findings on disparity implications of the current MTM eligibility criteria among the main reasons to change MTM eligibility. Combining medication review and treatment planning, MTM services were implemented by CMS in 2006 as a part of Part D based on the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) and have been shown to significantly improve pharmacotherapy outcomes. MTM services are long overdue because drug-related morbidity/mortality is an age-old and costly public health problem, particularly among the elderly. However, as we have shown, Medicare MTM eligibility criteria are an institutionalized cause for disparities: the drug use/cost basis of MTM eligibility means that racial and ethnic minorities are less likely to qualif because, given the same health status, Blacks and Hispanics tend to use fewer drugs/incur lower drug costs than Whites. The recently proposed 2015 MTM eligibility criteria merely lower the drug use/cost thresholds within MMA statutory framework, and, thus, are unlikely to address these disparities. Moreover, MMA MTM eligibility criteria recently were found ineffective in capturing suboptimal-therapy problems such as drug nonadherence.  The goal of this project is to address these issues by finding equitable and effective MTM eligibility criteria. ""Effectiveness is essential for realizing MTM's potential, and ""equality of access"" is the most widely- used definition of equity in policy documents. Specific Aim 1: To test whether using Star Ratings criteria, which we propose based on the medication safety/adherence measures in the CMS Part D Star Ratings system, can reduce racial and ethnic disparities in MTM eligibility. Specific Aim 2: To compare the effectiveness of the MTM eligibility criteria under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and MMA in identifying patients with medication utilization issues. We will compare them on sensitivity, specificity, predictive values (positive/negative), and the receiver operating characteristic curves. ACA MTM eligibility criteria are important to analyze, as recognized by CMS, because these criteria incorporate medication utilization issues within the MMA MTM eligibility framework. Specific Aim 3: To examine the comparative effectiveness of the MTM eligibility criteria under ACA and MMA in identifying medication utilization issues across racial and ethnic groups. We will also examine predictors for disparities and conduct disease-specific analyses. We will use 2013 Medicare Part D data linked to Parts A and B claims, the Master Beneficiary Summary File, and the Area Health Resource File.

"Assessing the Effect of the ACA and State Policies on Racial/Ethnic, Sex, and Insurance-Based Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Analysis of state and national policies that affect racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare is a research topic of specific interest for the NIMHD, and simulated consumer (audit) studies have emerged as an important methodology for measuring disparities and assessing the effects of public and private policies on disparities. By experimentally controlling for consumer characteristics, such studies avoid the responder biases associated with surveys and the limitations of utilization analyses (e.g., controlling for differences in health and treatment preferences). The Longitudinal Access to Physicians Study (LAPS) in this proposal is innovative because it is the first to audit the effects of race/ethnicit and sex on access, to audit a national random sample of primary care physicians, and to audit access for Medicare patients. In LAPS, student research assistants (SRAs) call the offices of primary care physicians to request appointment information for a purported uncle or aunt. Each physician is randomly assigned a male or female patient profile with an insurance type and a name signaling race/ethnicity. The central hypotheses underlying this proposal are: a) Increases in the demand for physician services due to the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) major insurance expansion will initially decrease appointment availability, but that appointment availability will improve over time as the health care system adjusts to the insurance expansion; b) The decrease in appointment availability will be smaller in states that experience smaller insurance expansions and have more generous physician reimbursement policies; and c) Changes in access will be differ for population subgroups leading to changes in disparities in access. These hypotheses will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Measuring changes in 2014, 2015, and 2016 from ACA- baseline in appointment availability and in disparities in appointment availability; and 2) Measuring changes in 2014, 2015, and 2016 from ACA-baseline in appointment availability and in disparities in appointment availability in states with different Medicaid expansion and reimbursement policies. The proposed research is significant because the results of the study are expected to provide strong evidence of the effects of the ACA as well as insurance and reimbursement-related state policies on disparities in access to primary care physicians. This research is relevant to the goals of the NIMHD because its results are expected to enable policymakers to better identify factors contributing to disparities and design effective policies for their amelioration. This study will also fulfill the goal of research enhancement by strengthening the research environment at Portland State University, the largest and most diverse university in Oregon. All SRAs learn the importance of ethics, human subjects' protections, and consistency in research. Some SRAs also learn about study design, statistical methods, and the broader literature on disparities. This study will create opportunitie for greater student participation and interest in disparities research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Equitable access to primary care is a key indicator of health system performance, but remains difficult to assess using surveys or utilization data. This is the first simulated consumer (audit) study to assess the effects of insurance and reimbursement-related policies on racial/ethnic disparities in access to primary care physicians.

"Disparities in Cancer Screening: The Role of Medicaid Policy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study examines how existing and new policies that affect the generosity of state Medicaid programs impact breast and cervical cancer screening and related health outcomes among low-income women. There are substantial disparities in breast and cervical cancer diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes in the United States by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic and insurance status. Further, resources to improve access to and quality of care for underserved populations are limited. In recent years, the federal government granted many states increased flexibility to cover low-income adults through Medicaid waivers. Further expansions to Medicaid are anticipated under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Current variation in state Medicaid programs and anticipated changes under the ACA provide natural experiments for studying the effect of public insurance on screening for low-income women. We consider the effect of pre- and post-reform variation in eligibility between and within states, as well as the effect of physician payment and patient cost sharing on screening. Understanding how state Medicaid policies affect cancer screening will help guide strategies to reach under-screened populations and add to evidence regarding the costs and benefits of different policies. In addition, we study how variation in Medicaid generosity across states and over time is related to outcomes including cancer incidence and stage at diagnosis, the single most important predictor of survival. The project brings together complementary secondary data from a number of sources. Nationally representative survey data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System will be used to study the effects of Medicaid eligibility on breast and cervical cancer screening among low-income populations. Medicaid administrative claims and utilization data will allow us to consider the effects of changes in eligibility as well as physician payment and patient cost sharing on screening among Medicaid enrollees. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry data will be used to estimate the effects of changes in Medicaid generosity on cancer incidence and stage at diagnosis. Our analytic approach employs a quasi- experimental design to compare changes in outcomes among groups that would have been affected by changes in Medicaid policy (eligibility, payment rates, or cost sharing) to similar groups that were not subject to polcy changes. In addition to considering the effect of policy changes on all low-income women, we will examine whether effects of expansions are larger among racial and ethnic minorities, reducing disparities. This is the first study to consider the effect of recent Medicaid policies regarding eligibility, physician payment, and cost sharing on breast and cervical cancer screening, which are the most important measures for the prevention of breast and cervical cancer morbidity and mortality. The results will provide timely evidence on how Medicaid policy affects women's preventive healthcare utilization and health outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Low-income women are less likely to receive recommended cancer screenings that can lead to earlier detection and treatment that subsequently reduces morbidity and mortality. This project examines how state Medicaid policies impact breast and cervical cancer screening and related health outcomes among low-income women, and results will help guide strategies to reach under-screened populations and add to evidence regarding the costs and benefits of policies related to Medicaid eligibility, physician payment, and benefit design.

"Effectiveness of a prison system-based Medicaid enrollment program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Addressing the health of incarcerated populations is a necessary step in reducing U.S. health disparities. Many of the same socioeconomic, behavioral, and community-level risk factors that place one at risk for imprisonment also are associated with risk for poor health. Accordingly, former prisoners have a disproportionately high prevalence of chronic and disabling health conditions and, unsurprisingly, suffer excessively high rates of all-cause mortality. With 700,000 prisoners released annually, the health of these individuals has a pervasive effect on the health of the communities and families to which they return. The transition from prison back to the community is particularly difficult an is considerably more challenging for those with severe and chronic health conditions, most of whom have no health insurance. Medicaid is an important source of health care coverage for the impoverished and among low-income populations and has been shown to increase use of routine healthcare and improve self-reported health outcomes. While released prisoners with severe and chronic health conditions may be eligible for Medicaid, enrollment depends on their successful navigation of an application process that is both difficult and time consuming; as a result, enrollment is relatively uncommon. Nearly all state prison systems have interpreted federal Medicaid policies as mandating the termination of Medicaid benefits upon incarceration and prohibiting Medicaid enrollment during incarceration, thus creating additional barriers to Medicaid enrollment. In recent years, however, top federal Medicaid administrators have clarified that prisoners may enroll in Medicaid during incarceration, albeit only to pay for inpatient healthcare provided outside of the prison system (e.g., a community hospital). In response to this clarification, about 1/3 of state prison systems have created programs to facilitate prisoner enrollment into Medicaid. Importantly, prisoners enrolled in Medicaid during their incarceration can resume their Medicaid coverage immediately upon reentering the community. Therefore, prison-based Medicaid enrollment assistance programs (PBMEAPs) may play a pivotal role in prisoners' post-release access to health services and, consequently, their health. Moreover, in North Carolina (NC) and the 24 other Medicaid non-expansion states, PBMEAPs will be one of the best opportunities for prison-involved persons with chronic health conditions to enroll in Medicaid. Despite the potential impact of these programs, even basic evaluations of PBMEAPs have yet to be conducted. In this application, we have proposed a mixed methods approach to examine the effectiveness and the cost implications of the PBMEAP in the NC prison system. We will examine prisoners' rate of Medicaid enrollment, their post-release outcomes, and their attitudes about healthcare access. We will also examine the program's cost-savings for the prison system and factors that affect program performance. Our findings will provide state policy makers, prison officials, and Medicaid administrators with a data-driven understanding of the program's effectiveness and its impact on healthcare access and health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prison-based Medicaid enrollment assistance programs (PBMEAPs) have the potential to improve access to healthcare for prisoners upon their release. Our evaluation of the NC prison system's PBMEAP will provide policy-makers, prison officials, and Medicaid administrators in NC and other states with a data-driven understanding of the impact of this program on healthcare access and health, and will help prison administrators evaluate and improve their program. If found to be effective, adoption of PBMEAPs among other state prison systems could have a profound effect on diminishing health disparities experienced by released prisoners, one of the most underserved segments of US society",Effectiveness of a prison system-based Medicaid enrollment program,9039489,R01MD008979,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Community Hospitals ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Inpatients ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' North Carolina ', ' Play ', ' jail inmate ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' Prisoner ', ' Prisons ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Savings ', ' Societies ', ' Substance Dependence ', ' Substance Addiction ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Time ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Administrator ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Improve Access ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' HIV/HCV ', ' HIV/Hepatitis C ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,380000,0.19957794272468604
"Effects of Expanded Coverage on Access, Health Care and Health in the South ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will provide timely and rigorous analysis of the effect of the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) insurance coverage expansions on health care use and outcomes among a large cohort of low-income adults in 12 southern states (VA, WV, KY, TN, NC, SC, FL ,GA, AL, MS, LA, AR). The ACA's coverage reforms encompass the largest insurance expansion since Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. Examining the effects of expansions on health care and outcomes for socio-demographic and clinical groups intended to benefit from expanded coverage will be critical to advancing scientific knowledge about the relationship between insurance coverage and health and to informing state decisions to expand Medicaid over the next several years. In no region of the country are rates of uninsurance higher, the prevalence of chronic conditions and cancer greater, and the implementation of the ACA's coverage expansions expected to be more varied, than in the South. The proposed 5-year research project will draw on these regional characteristics and the largest cohort of low- income, uninsured, and minority adults ever recruited in the US (nearly 85,000 in total), the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS). We will augment existing baseline and follow-up SCCS survey data from 2002-14 by fielding a timely additional survey starting in the second year of ACA reforms (2015-16) and by adding questions to a planned round of follow-up in 2016-17 to support consistent assessment of early and later effects of the reforms on health and to explore patient experiences obtaining coverage and accessing care in the post-expansions era. By combining these data with cancer registry and Medicare and Medicaid claims data through established data linkages, as well as establishing novel data linkages with state hospital discharge databases, we aim to quantify the effects of coverage expansion on: (Aim 1) access to care, cancer screening and use of preventive clinical services; (Aim 2) self-reported health outcomes, mortality, cancer care, and use of emergent and inpatient care; and (Aim 3) on access to care, utilization, and outcomes for adults with prior coverage whose access might be compromised by the expansions. To identify these effects, we will apply rigorous quasi-experimental difference-in-difference designs, leveraging both within- and between-state variation in coverage expansions. Our analytic approach will also incorporate regression and propensity score-based adjustment to balance observed characteristics between comparison groups. Finally, due to the longitudinal nature of our data and high observed mortality rates in the cohort, where appropriate we will use advanced methodological approaches to modeling death and health outcomes jointly. In short, our timely quasi-experimental analyses will help characterize the value of the ACA's coverage reforms, will inform policy debates over coverage expansions moving forward, and will advance understanding of the effects of insurance coverage on health care use and health outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will provide timely and rigorous analysis of the effect of health insurance coverage expansions on health care use and outcomes among a large cohort of low-income adults in 12 southeastern states. Using a quasi-experimental research design, we will quantify the effects of coverage expansion through Medicaid and private health insurance exchanges on (Aim 1) access to care, cancer screening and use of preventive clinical services; (Aim 2) self-reported health outcomes, mortality, cancer care, and use of emergent and inpatient care; and (Aim 3) on access to care, utilization, and outcomes for adults with prior coverage whose access might be compromised by the expansions.","Effects of Expanded Coverage on Access, Health Care and Health in the South",9118123,R01CA189152,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitals ', ' State Hospitals ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Medicaid ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' Cover-up ', ' base ', ' court ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Data Linkages ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Staging ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Country ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' Modeling ', ' cancer care ', ' Vital Status ', ' Low income ', ' Adverse Late Effects ', ' Late Effects ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Improve Access ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Clinical Services ', ' comparison group ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' care preference ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' federal poverty level ', ' data registry ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' ']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,1598501,0.15499527262807963
"Medicaid Expansion in Oregon:  Access and Health Outcomes for Women and Infants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early intervention to identify and treat chronic disease and modify behavioral risk factors among women of reproductive age has the potential to significantly reduce their morbidity and mortality and improve their pregnancy outcomes. Lack of health insurance has been a major barrier to early intervention and preventive care among low-income women of reproductive age. However, the 2014 expansion of Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) will make millions of low-income women newly eligible for Medicaid and preventive health services. An integrated data system is essential to evaluate the impact of this expansion on the health of women of reproductive age and their infants. Research using this data system will inform future program planning and identify best practices and areas of greatest need. We propose to create an integrated data system that links Oregon Medicaid data with birth and death certificates and hospital discharge data. Further, we will include data on the quality of Medicaid services that are not available to other states. The proposed study is a collaborative effort between Oregon State University and the Oregon Health Authority. Oregon is an ideal state in which to conduct the proposed study because of its ongoing commitment to Medicaid health care delivery reform and the commitment of state leaders to collaborate across divisions and programs to ensure this project's success. The project also has the support of key state stakeholders in maternal and child health and women's health. The specific aims of the proposal are to1) develop a research agenda, in collaboration with key stakeholders, to evaluate the expansion of Medicaid on the health of Medicaid-eligible women of reproductive age, mothers, and infants in Oregon; 2) link Oregon Medicaid data for female enrollees ages 15-44 and their infants to statewide datasets, including (but not limited to) live birth, fetal death, infant death, and hospital discharge data, beginning with 2008 and continuing until 2016, as data become available; and 3) conduct planned analyses and disseminate findings. The research agenda will include key research questions that assess the effect of Medicaid expansion on Medicaid enrollment and access to care for low-income women; utilization of services by women and infants enrolled in Medicaid; general health behaviors, risks, and outcomes for these women; and pregnancy complications and poor birth outcomes. We will also measure disparities that remain after Medicaid expansion, to inform strategies to mitigate those disparities on an ongoing basis. We will use results of these analyses to construct simulations that extend this study's findings into implications and lessons for policy makers and stakeholders in other states that are expanding Medicaid. Results of these analyses and simulations will provide valuable information to support health reform efforts, both in Oregon and across the U.S, to reduce the public health burden and improve population health among women of reproductive age, including pregnancy and infant health outcomes. Project Narrative The collaborative research team will create an integrated, state-level data system that links Medicaid data with other existing data sets. Analyses will be conducted that will provide valuable evidence on the impact of Medicaid expansion in Oregon and across the US. Findings may be used to improve access to health care services and health outcomes among Medicaid-eligible women and their children.",Medicaid Expansion in Oregon:  Access and Health Outcomes for Women and Infants,9095845,U01DP004783,[''],NCCDPHP,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,359744,0.1412024080438288
"Epidemiology, Exploration and Evaluation: Addressing potentially dangerous medications in Medicaid children with a mental health diagnosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental health diagnoses are common in pediatric practice. Abundant evidence demonstrates that many medications used to treat children with mental health conditions are prescribed in circumstances or combinations for which they are not recommended. Such use may lead to patient harms such as onset of diabetes or suicidal ideation, and potentially avoidable emergency department visits and hospitalizations. This project proposes (1) to describe in detail the epidemiology of patient safety in ambulatory care settings, focusing on medication safety in children with mental health diagnoses who are enrolled in New York State Medicaid ; (2) to assess the extent to which three strategies: a) receipt of primary care in a National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)-recognized patient-centered medical home (PCMH); b) a new state policy (""carve-in"") that assigns responsibility to manage the prescription pharmaceutical insurance benefit to managed care plans rather than the state Medicaid program; and c) a more patient-centered, comprehensive set of medication reconciliation (med rec) practices can reduce potentially dangerous medication use or undesirable consequences / patient harms in this populations; and (3) to assess whether or not a state Department of Health quality department's implementation of a survey to assess medication reconciliation in practices throughout Medicaid is an effective way to enhance the performance of such practices. The epidemiological study will use cross sectional, univariate, bivariate, and multivariable analyses for each year from 2014 to 2017, including logistic regression and regression risk analysis. It will look at clinical, patient, contextual, and practice characteristics that are associated with lower and higher uses of potentially dangerous medication practices and undesirable outcomes. It will describe identified disparities, considering characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity, rural/urban residence, foster care status, and level of poverty in the home county. A propensity score analysis will help to assess the association of the specified medication practices with undesirable outcomes and patient harm. Assessment of the PCMH and med rec strategies will utilize propensity score analyses that are modified from the models developed during the epidemiological analysis. The state carve-in policy, implemented in late 2011, will be assessed using a segmented regression analysis of an interrupted time series from 2008 to 2016.=Medication reconciliation practice will be assessed using a survey instrument developed by an AHRQ- CMS CHIPRA Center of Excellence in the federal Pediatric Quality Measures Program. The impact of measurement on med rec practices will be assessed using a cluster randomized trial with a stepped wedge design, surveying one third of practices in all years, on third in years two and three and one thir in year three only. This project promises to provide more detailed insight both into an important patient safety risk in ambulatory settings for a vulnerable population and also into how well several strategies reduce risk in real world settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal addresses several key public health concerns: the safe and unsafe use of medication in children who are in Medicaid who have been diagnosed with at least one mental health condition; the impact of clinical and policy approaches that have been suggested as possibly making care safer through improved medication practices; and the description of both the current state and the evolution over the course of the grant of medication reconciliation practices by clinical practices. Medication reconciliation is a series of policies and practices that are intended to make medication use safer by enhancing coordination between patients/families, and the variety of clinicians who are taking care of them. Our multidisciplinary team will describe the detailed epidemiology of potentially unsafe medication practices and undesirable outcomes for these children in New York State Medicaid; assess the impact of the patient-centered medical home, of medication reconciliation practices and of a statewide policy change that assigns responsibility of the management of drug insurance benefits to managed care vendors; and will look at whether or not monitoring practices for medication reconciliation practices increases the performance of desirable practices.","Epidemiology, Exploration and Evaluation: Addressing potentially dangerous medications in Medicaid children with a mental health diagnosis",9146896,R01HS024433,[''],AHRQ,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,496996,0.04657532887021482
"The Early Impact of Medicaid Expansion on Health Center Grantees: Effects on Quality Performance and Capacity to Provide Care ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the June 2012 Supreme Court decision that made Medicaid expansion optional for states, many childless low-income adults in non-expansion states are left without access to affordable coverage. Not only does this expansion decision affect individuals, but it has important, unknown impacts on providers serving these individuals, including health centers. In the 29 states and districts that have expanded, most previously uninsured patients served by health centers will gain coverage. In the 22 states that have not expanded as of January 2015, most individuals under 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL) who would have otherwise gained coverage are left uninsured; for health centers in these states, this will likely result in lesser patient revenue. Given that sufficient revenue is required to maintain staffing levels, meet demand, and provide high quality care, this may also affect capacity to provide care and the quality of care delivered. It may also compromise health centers' continued ability to combat racial/ethnic disparities in quality. This is important becaus health centers play a critical role in providing access to quality primary care for vulnerable populations who would otherwise be without access to such care. Given the projected increase in demand for primary care services coupled with health center funding reductions from states and local entities, understanding how the decision to expand versus not expand Medicaid affects the quality performance of health centers and their capacity to provide care is essential to protecting health centers and the vulnerable populations they serve. Our specific aims are: (1) to assess the early impact of Medicaid expansion on the quality performance of health center grantees, which will include a pre (2007-2013) and post (2014-2015) assessment of 11 process and 3 outcome measures; a sub-aim will be to assess to what extent, if any, Medicaid expansion affects racial/ethnic disparities in quality, and (2) to assess the early impact of Medicaid expansion on health center grantees' capacity to provide care, which will include a pre (2007-2013) and post (2014-2015) assessment of change in total number of services provided and total number of patients served, by category of service. Our hypothesis is that compared to health centers in non-expansion states, centers in Medicaid expansion states will experience higher quality performance in the two years following expansion, as well as reduced racial/ethnic disparities in quality. We also hypothesize that capacity to provide care will be higher in centers in expansion states compared to non-expansion states. We will use HRSA's 2007-2015 Uniform Data System (UDS) data, which are reported annually at the health center level. Propensity score matching of cases (expansion) versus controls (non-expansion) will be done at the health center level and an econometric difference-in-differences framework will be used to estimate the effect. Findings will contribute to the evidence base available to states looking to potentially expand their Medicaid programs, while helping states better understand how some of their most vulnerable populations are affected by Medicaid expansion.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will extend state policy maker's knowledge about if and how state Medicaid expansion decisions affect the quality performance of health center grantees and their capacity to provide care. It will also illuminate the effect of Medicaid expansion on racial/ethnic disparities in health outcomes for health center patients. Here, understanding how the decision to expand versus not expand Medicaid affects health centers is essential to protecting health centers and the vulnerable populations that they serve, given that non-expanding states still have the option to expand Medicaid eligibility.        ",The Early Impact of Medicaid Expansion on Health Center Grantees: Effects on Quality Performance and Capacity to Provide Care,9119240,R36HS024652,[''],AHRQ,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R36,2016,43107,0.1267437539775706
"Assessing the Potential for a State Medicaid Reform Model to Reduce Disparities Project Summary: Provisions in the Affordable Care Act allow states substantial flexibility and opportunity to restructure their Medicaid programs. Given the disproportionate share of racial and ethnic minorities areas covered by the Medicaid program, changes in Medicaid policy provide a unique opportunity to address health disparities. However, Medicaid policies also face significant challenges, particularly in the ways in which this relatively low-reimbursing insurance program has left beneficiaries with problems of access and quality. One of the more ambitious Medicaid transformations has occurred in Oregon, which launched its system of “Coordinated Care Organizations,” or CCOs, in 2012. In legislation outlining the CCO model, the State of Oregon explicitly identified “Health Equity and Eliminating Health Disparities” as a fundamental target for delivery system changes. CCOs are required to: submit Community Health Improvement Plans, with goals for reducing disparities; provide services geographically located close to where members reside and offered in nontraditional settings that are accessible to diverse communities and underserved populations; provide incentives to attract underrepresented minority groups into the healthcare workforce; and broaden the use of community health workers. Using extensive claims and Electronic Health Record data and building on large policy experiment in Oregon, this proposal aims to assess the ways in which racial and ethnic disparities can be reduced through Medicaid reform, while also tracking the extent to which access and quality change for rural populations and the Medicaid program at large during these significant reform and expansion periods. Project Narrative/Relevance: This study evaluates the role of Medicaid in reducing disparities for racial and ethnic minorities. Using a policy experiment in Oregon, this study will provide critical information on the effectiveness of reforms that target the reduction of disparities, as well as measuring the effectiveness of community health workers and related approaches that can be adopted across Medicaid programs.

"Using Satellite National Health Accounts to Understand Health and Cost Changes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Though health expenditures in the U.S. are carefully tracked by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the health outcomes associated with these expenditures are not. To address this need, our past research has developed detailed measures of population health and medical spending using existing national data, in order to systematically and jointly measure the benefits and the costs of medical care. These methods have been developed to serve as a Satellite National Health Account, enabling a better understanding of the health sector in the United States. We propose two new avenues of analysis using these tools that will greatly expand our understanding of health change in relation to costs across the U.S. population. The first is to examine health in conjunction with costs among all age groups- -including the elderly, middle-aged, young adults, and children-and among different socioeconomic groups. The second is to examine the health of those with different diseases, and understand specifically how it has changed over time in terms of the relationship of each disease to health and medical spending.

"Effect of School-Based Health Centers on Reducing Students Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in 5 persons in poverty is a child <18 years, and this number is growing, especially in the South. Further, 40% of African American and 34% of Hispanic children <18 years live in low-income households, and 55% of poor rural African-American children have less access to health services. Since a majority of public school students are from low-income families in both the South and West, public schools present an opportunity to reach underserved populations on-site with quality healthcare services. For > 2 decades model School-based Health Centers (SBHCs) have been tested to meet health needs of disparity population, but less than 1% of public elementary schools house SBHCs. Four issues must be addressed in taking SBHCs to scale: sustainability, evidence of community need and support, evidence of health and health cost impact, and fidelity to exemplar models. The ongoing Georgia SBHC Project provides operational solutions to the first two issues. The goal of the proposed study, EPOCH (Evaluating Processes and Outcomes for Children), will take advantage of an opportunity to conduct a ""natural experiment"" that will assess the ability of this approach to solve the other two issues. We will examine the effects of expanding SBHCs across three public elementary school sites in Georgia that differ by environment (rural, small city, and suburban) and race / ethnicity (one each being predominantly African American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white children). A specific focus will be the effects of SBHCs on improved access to primary care and, in turn, on the level of health outcomes including obesity, uncontrolled asthma, and Emergency Department and hospital utilization and costs to the Medicaid program. We will conduct a year-by-year comparison of health indicators and health care costs for children with and without access to SBHCs. In a novel approach to evaluating SBHCs, we will conduct a full-scale process and outcome evaluation, following the Implementation Fidelity model proposed by Carroll, et al., and modified by Hasson. This will include active monitoring to measure program adaptations, secondary analysis of SBHCs' benchmarking, schools' routine FitnessGrams and absenteeism statistics, and by linking children enrolled in an SBHC to their Medicaid claims records. This quasi-experimental, longitudinal study will include 7 years' data (3 pre-, 1 during, and 3 post-SBHC implementation) for the 3 SBHC schools and 3 similar, non-SBHC schools. Additionally, Medicaid data will be extracted for children living in the 6 schools' zip codes to conduct utilization and cost analyses on improving specific health outcomes (e.g., asthma and obesity) and reducing health disparities in rural and minority populations. The EPOCH study offers an opportunity to create a new evidence base for the role of SBHCs in states without the Medicaid expansion. Comprehensive SBHCs may have greater importance there because of the lack of alternatives for children to access free or subsidized health care. These findings will also inform the nation as it considers reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in 2015. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal for the proposed research is to evaluate the effectiveness of school-based health centers (SBHCs) in reducing disparities in obesity and asthma and improving school attendance in the low income child populations of the southeast.

"Community-based HIT Tools for Cancer Screening and Health Insurance Promotion DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer morbidity and mortality risks can be greatly reduced through screening and prevention. Patients without health insurance are much less likely to receive evidence-based cancer screenings and preventive care. Interventions that optimize and stabilize health insurance coverage could substantially increase rates of receipt of timely cancer preventive care. As many patients with unstable coverage receive care at Community Health Centers (CHCs), CHCs are well-positioned to provide such interventions. Recent advances in CHCs' health information technology (HIT) create new opportunities for using automated processes and data to support insurance outreach efforts. We propose to conduct a clinic-level cluster randomized trial in 12 CHCs (~47,000 patients aged 18-64) to test the effectiveness of Community-based HIT Tools for Cancer Screening and Health Insurance Promotion (""CATCH-UP"" tools) at improving rates of (1) cancer screening and prevention services, and (2) health insurance coverage. The CATCH-UP tools are designed to identify and reach uninsured CHC patients who are eligible for enrollment in public insurance coverage, and to encourage re-enrollment of publicly-insured patients before coverage gaps occur. Modeled after HIT tools proven effective for chronic disease management, the CATCH-UP tools include a panel management / data aggregator system coupled with automated patient outreach and communication. We will partner with OCHIN, a non-profit community HIT network that hosts one of the nation's largest CHC electronic health record platforms.  We hypothesize that patients of CHCs that have these tools will have higher rates of continuous insurance coverage, and as a result, higher rates of up-to-date age- and gender-appropriate cancer screening and prevention services, compared to patients of CHCs without such tools. Our aims are as follows. Aim 1: Evaluate the effect of the CATCH-UP intervention on up-to-date status of cancer screening and preventive care received by patients. We will assess gender- and age-appropriate rates of screening and assessment (colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, smoking, obesity); immunization (human papillomavirus vaccination); and counseling (smoking, weight). Aim 2: Evaluate the effect of the CATCH-UP intervention on patients' insurance coverage rates. To accomplish Aims 1 and 2, we will conduct clinic- and patient-level difference-in-differences quantitative analyses to compare pre- and post-intervention changes between control and intervention groups. Aim 3: Evaluate the intervention implementation process, patient and CHC staff acceptance and use of the CATCH-UP tools, and the patient-, provider-, and system-level factors associated with successful implementation and sustainability of the tools, using mixed methods. Understanding how HIT tools in CHCs and other community primary care settings can support insurance enrollment and retention efforts will be key to successfully expanding insurance coverage and reducing disparities in cancer screening and prevention services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients without health insurance are much less likely to receive recommended cancer screening and prevention services, and Community Health Centers (CHCs) provide a health care safety net for many of these uninsured patients. We will conduct a cluster-randomized trial in 12 CHCs to test the effectiveness of implementing Community-based HIT Tools for Cancer Screening and Health Insurance Promotion (""CATCH- UP"" tools) at improving rates of (1) cancer screening and prevention services; and (2) health insurance coverage. Using mixed-methods, we will also evaluate the intervention implementation process, patients' and CHC staff members' acceptance and use of the CATCH-UP tools, and factors associated with successful implementation and sustainability of the tools.",Community-based HIT Tools for Cancer Screening and Health Insurance Promotion,9093725,R01CA181452,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' automated data processing ', ' Electronic Data Processing ', ' Computer Data Processing ', ' Automatic Data Processing ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Counseling ', ' nonsister chromatid exchange ', ' Crossing Over ', ' Genetic Crossing Over ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Immunostimulation ', ' Immunological Stimulation ', ' Immunological Sensitization ', ' Immunologic Stimulation ', ' Immunologic Sensitization ', ' Immunization ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Oregon ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoking ', ' Testing ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' expiration ', ' Recovery ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' data management ', ' novel ', ' prevention service ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' behavioral assessment ', ' Behavior assessment ', ' Effectiveness ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' practice-based research network ', ' post intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' safety net ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' primary care setting ', ' health information technology ', ' screening ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' ']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,609325,0.07911043980834237

"ACCESS: Assessing Community Cancer care after insurance ExpanSionS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer morbidity and mortality is greatly reduced through screening and prevention, but uninsured patients are much less likely than insured patients to receive these evidence-based services as recommended. Similarly, uninsured cancer survivors receive fewer primary and preventive care services than those with health insurance. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) called for every state to significantly expand Medicaid coverage by 2014; it is hypothesized that the ACA's Medicaid expansions could substantially (i) improve access to essential cancer preventive and screening services for previously uninsured patients, and (ii) facilitate better access to routine healthcare among cancer survivors who gain new health insurance. Little is yet known about how ACA Medicaid expansions are impacting the delivery of recommended cancer care. The 2012 United States (US) Supreme Court ruling that made ACA Medicaid expansions optional for states created a natural experiment to answer this important question. As of April 1, 2015, 30 states and the District of Columbia had expanded Medicaid, while 20 states had not. We will use this unprecedented natural experiment to study the effect of state-level Medicaid expansions on rates of cancer screening, cancer preventive services, and healthcare for cancer survivors. We will use electronic health record (EHR) data from the ADVANCE clinical data research network, which has data from 718 community health centers (CHCs), including 476 CHCs in 13 Medicaid expansion states and 242 CHCs in 8 non-expansion states. From this dataset, we will collect detailed information on changes in health insurance and healthcare service receipt, with data spanning 9 years (pre- and post-expansion), comparing states that expanded Medicaid, and those that did not. The specific aims are as follows: Aim 1. Compare pre-post receipt of cancer prevention and screening among CHC patients in Medicaid expansion versus non-expansion states. Aim 2. Compare pre-post insurance status, visits, and receipt of routine, recommended primary and preventive care among cancer survivors seen in CHCs in expansion versus non-expansion states. Aim 3. Compare pre-post cancer prevention, screening, and survivor care for newly insured (gained Medicaid in post-period), already insured (had Medicaid coverage in pre- and post-periods), and continuously uninsured (no coverage in pre- and post-periods) CHC patients in states that expanded Medicaid. This project builds on our team's experience studying health insurance, primary care, and receipt of preventive services. The ADVANCE dataset positions us uniquely to study national-level impacts of the ACA. Importantly, this project aligns with National Cancer Institute (NCI) goals to increase knowledge regarding cancer control and prevention. According to the NCI, ""prevention has the potential to save more lives from cancer than treatment...which underlines the importance of strongly supporting this research area."" Also, findings will be relevant to policy and practice, and will inform further improvements in the US healthcare system to mitigate disparities in cancer prevention and survivor care for vulnerable populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Some states implemented Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansions while other states did not, thus creating a natural experiment to study the impact of increased access to health insurance on cancer screening, cancer preventive services, and cancer survivor care. This innovative, timely study will use electronic health record (EHR) data from the ADVANCE clinical data research network (CDRN) of PCORnet, which has EHR data from 718 community health centers (CHCs), including 476 CHCs in 13 states that expanded Medicaid (n=576,711 patients), and 242 CHCs in 8 states that did not expand Medicaid (n=361,421 patients). The ADVANCE CDRN dataset uniquely positions us to assess cancer screening, prevention, and survivor care among vulnerable populations immediately after the ACA Medicaid expansions, and to follow these patients for several years after this landmark health policy natural experiment.        ",ACCESS: Assessing Community Cancer care after insurance ExpanSionS,9080411,R01CA204267,"['neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"The Effects of Accountable Care Organizations on Health Care Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) are being pursued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as a means to rein in health care cost growth while improving quality of care, but little is known about how ACO efforts to improve health care efficiency might affect health care equity. In this context, the candidate (Dr. Valerie A. Lewis) seeks to understand how ACOs affect racial and socioeconomic disparities in health care outcomes. The candidate, a sociologist and health services researcher at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, will leverage this application to develop her research agenda and develop into an independent investigator. During the period of support, she will pursue didactic instruction in several disciplines, including training in clinical conditions and organizational behavior along with leadership development. She will also have ample opportunity for mentored, project-based learning, including developing advanced understanding of how to measure quality of care. The proposed research plan has three aims: Aim 1. To examine Medicare ACO coverage across patient race and socioeconomic status. Dr. Lewis will use Medicare claims data to examine whether disadvantaged patients are more or less likely than other patients to receive care from ACO providers compared to non-ACO providers and will examine the relative effects of (a) patterns of provider participation in ACOs and (b) patient selection. She will then use the National Survey of ACOs to determine if disadvantaged ACO patients are cared for at ACOs that are systematically different from other ACOs (e.g., types of ACO providers or services, ACO capabilities). Aim 2. To examine how Medicare ACO programs impact disparities in patient care outcomes. Dr. Lewis will use longitudinal Medicare claims data to examine how Medicare ACO programs affect disparities in quality outcomes over time. Analysis will focus on the extent to which changes in disparities are a result of differences withi providers (e.g., all ACO providers improve care for disadvantaged groups) or across providers (e.g., providers serving disadvantaged patients make rapid improvements under ACO programs). Aim 3. To understand how organizational characteristics, capabilities, and strategies influence changing disparities over time under Medicare ACO programs. Dr. Lewis will examine how and why organizational characteristics and capabilities influence changing disparities under ACO models. She will use data from the National Survey of ACOs to explore how ACOs' organizational characteristics (e.g., partnership structure, governance, capabilities) and implementation strategy (e.g., care management programs, physician feedback mechanisms) affect changes in disparities over time. Finally, she will follow up with in-depth interviews to understand how organizational characteristics may be detrimental or beneficial to changing disparities in care. Findings from this project will inform policymakers and implementers about how the ACO model can best facilitate improved health care equity alongside important goals of increased efficiency. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) hold the promise of reducing health care costs while improving quality, but little is known about how these initiatives may affect disparities in health care outcomes by race or socioeconomic status.

"Medicaid Expansion in Oregon:  Access and Health Outcomes for Women and Infants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early intervention to identify and treat chronic disease and modify behavioral risk factors among women of reproductive age has the potential to significantly reduce their morbidity and mortality and improve their pregnancy outcomes. Lack of health insurance has been a major barrier to early intervention and preventive care among low-income women of reproductive age. However, the 2014 expansion of Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) will make millions of low-income women newly eligible for Medicaid and preventive health services. An integrated data system is essential to evaluate the impact of this expansion on the health of women of reproductive age and their infants. Research using this data system will inform future program planning and identify best practices and areas of greatest need. We propose to create an integrated data system that links Oregon Medicaid data with birth and death certificates and hospital discharge data. Further, we will include data on the quality of Medicaid services that are not available to other states. The proposed study is a collaborative effort between Oregon State University and the Oregon Health Authority. Oregon is an ideal state in which to conduct the proposed study because of its ongoing commitment to Medicaid health care delivery reform and the commitment of state leaders to collaborate across divisions and programs to ensure this project's success. The project also has the support of key state stakeholders in maternal and child health and women's health.

The research agenda will include key research questions that assess the effect of Medicaid expansion on Medicaid enrollment and access to care for low-income women; utilization of services by women and infants enrolled in Medicaid; general health behaviors, risks, and outcomes for these women; and pregnancy complications and poor birth outcomes. We will also measure disparities that remain after Medicaid expansion, to inform strategies to mitigate those disparities on an ongoing basis. We will use results of these analyses to construct simulations that extend this study's findings into implications and lessons for policy makers and stakeholders in other states that are expanding Medicaid. Results of these analyses and simulations will provide valuable information to support health reform efforts, both in Oregon and across the U.S, to reduce the public health burden and improve population health among women of reproductive age, including pregnancy and infant health outcomes.

"Effects of federal parity legislationon access to drug, alcohol, and mental health treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Historically, insurance coverage for drug, alcohol, and mental health (DAMH) care has been more limited than coverage for other forms of general health care. For decades, insurers defended this difference with arguments that equal coverage for DAMH care would lead to excessive use and high costs. More restrictive coverage has contributed over time to a large treatment gap in which most people in need of DAMH care have not received it. For those who have received care, financial protection has tended to be weaker. Since the 1990s, a series of state and federal laws have attempted to regulate insurance and mandate DAMH parity. One of the most comprehensive efforts has been the 2008 Paul Wellstone & Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity & Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA). This federal law seeks to strengthen private insurance coverage for DAMH care, but its effectiveness to date remains largely unknown. The purpose of this project is: (1) to investigate the effects of MHPAEA on how people access and pay for DAMH care; and (2) to measure racial/ethnic disparities in access to DAMH care and assess how MHPAEA has affected them. Principles of health economics predict MHPAEA will improve financial protection for DAMH care recipients, reducing uncertainty about out-of-pocket expenses and limiting risk for high, potentially catastrophic costs. Another less probable outcome is that MHPAEA will increase DAMH treatment rates as better coverage makes care more affordable. According to the Institute of Medicine model of health care disparities, however, institutional factors and discrimination may intervene to perpetuate and potentially deepen racial/ethnic disparities in access to DAMH care despite the new protections afforded by MHPAEA. To research these issues, this study will employ a quasi-experimental design using secondary analysis of existing data. Difference-in-differences models will be fit with pooled independent cross sections of survey data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2004-2013. Treatment rates and payment sources will be compared pre- and post-MHPAEA, testing multiple time-points post-MHPAEA to detect effects of staggered implementation. Survey respondents with private insurance will be compared to those with public sources of insurance and those without insurance. Generalized linear mixed models will be estimated to allow for analysis of individual-level observations clustered within states. The proposed research will produce preliminary empirical evidence on the effectiveness of MHPAEA. Results will be representative at state and national levels. Findings will contribute to an improved understanding of the role health insurance plays in determining how consumers access DAMH care. Findings may also inform future efforts to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in DAMH care and the overall DAMH treatment gap. As other research assesses the effects of the 2010 Affordable Care Act on access to DAMH treatment, the proposed study will provide a strong baseline evidence upon which to build.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Access to quality, affordable health care is a key factor in reducing the prevalence and impact of substance use disorders and mental illness in our society. Health insurance plays a crucial role in determining whether individuals with drug, alcohol, and mental health problems are able to access the care they need. This study will produce preliminary evidence about the effectiveness of a 2008 federal law intended to improve private health insurance coverage for drug, alcohol, and mental health treatment by mandating parity with coverage for comparable forms of medical care.        ","Effects of federal parity legislationon access to drug, alcohol, and mental health treatment",9124191,F31DA040402,"['Affect ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Awareness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Planning ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Benefits ', ' Insurers ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Laws ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' parity ', ' Play ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societies ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' total medical expenditure ', ' medical expenses not covered by insurance ', ' Uncovered Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' Uncovered Medical Expenses ', ' Out-of-Pocket Expense ', ' Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Respondent ', ' cooking ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Immune ', ' Side ', ' Source ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Services ', ' payment ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Science Policy ', ' trend ', ' cost ', ' consumer demand ', ' health economics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' care recipients ', ' care receiver ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' Health Care Research ', ' healthcare research ', ' ']",NIDA,BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,28423,0.05037254101947768
"Community-based HIT Tools for Cancer Screening and Health Insurance Promotion DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer morbidity and mortality risks can be greatly reduced through screening and prevention. Patients without health insurance are much less likely to receive evidence-based cancer screenings and preventive care. Interventions that optimize and stabilize health insurance coverage could substantially increase rates of receipt of timely cancer preventive care. As many patients with unstable coverage receive care at Community Health Centers (CHCs), CHCs are well-positioned to provide such interventions. Recent advances in CHCs' health information technology (HIT) create new opportunities for using automated processes and data to support insurance outreach efforts. We propose to conduct a clinic-level cluster randomized trial in 12 CHCs (~47,000 patients aged 18-64) to test the effectiveness of Community-based HIT Tools for Cancer Screening and Health Insurance Promotion (""CATCH-UP"" tools) at improving rates of (1) cancer screening and prevention services, and (2) health insurance coverage. The CATCH-UP tools are designed to identify and reach uninsured CHC patients who are eligible for enrollment in public insurance coverage, and to encourage re-enrollment of publicly-insured patients before coverage gaps occur. Modeled after HIT tools proven effective for chronic disease management, the CATCH-UP tools include a panel management / data aggregator system coupled with automated patient outreach and communication. We will partner with OCHIN, a non-profit community HIT network that hosts one of the nation's largest CHC electronic health record platforms.  We hypothesize that patients of CHCs that have these tools will have higher rates of continuous insurance coverage, and as a result, higher rates of up-to-date age- and gender-appropriate cancer screening and prevention services, compared to patients of CHCs without such tools. Our aims are as follows. Aim 1: Evaluate the effect of the CATCH-UP intervention on up-to-date status of cancer screening and preventive care received by patients. We will assess gender- and age-appropriate rates of screening and assessment (colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, smoking, obesity); immunization (human papillomavirus vaccination); and counseling (smoking, weight). Aim 2: Evaluate the effect of the CATCH-UP intervention on patients' insurance coverage rates. To accomplish Aims 1 and 2, we will conduct clinic- and patient-level difference-in-differences quantitative analyses to compare pre- and post-intervention changes between control and intervention groups. Aim 3: Evaluate the intervention implementation process, patient and CHC staff acceptance and use of the CATCH-UP tools, and the patient-, provider-, and system-level factors associated with successful implementation and sustainability of the tools, using mixed methods. Understanding how HIT tools in CHCs and other community primary care settings can support insurance enrollment and retention efforts will be key to successfully expanding insurance coverage and reducing disparities in cancer screening and prevention services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients without health insurance are much less likely to receive recommended cancer screening and prevention services, and Community Health Centers (CHCs) provide a health care safety net for many of these uninsured patients. We will conduct a cluster-randomized trial in 12 CHCs to test the effectiveness of implementing Community-based HIT Tools for Cancer Screening and Health Insurance Promotion (""CATCH- UP"" tools) at improving rates of (1) cancer screening and prevention services; and (2) health insurance coverage.

"Impacts of the Affordable Care Act on Health Care Utilization Project Summary/Abstract The proposed research will use data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to investigate the impacts of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on the health care utilization of non-elderly adults. The research will utilize the identification strategy developed by the proposal's investigators in a previous study that estimated the causal effects of the ACA on health insurance coverage in both Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states (Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, forthcoming). This strategy features a difference-in-difference-in-differences model with the differences coming from time, state Medicaid expansion status, and local area pre-treatment uninsured rate. This last source of variation, which arises because universal coverage initiatives provide the most intense treatments in areas with high baseline uninsured rates, allows us to disentangle the causal effect of the ACA from the underlying time trend while also accounting for the possible endogeneity of state Medicaid expansion decisions. The proposed research will move past estimating impacts on health insurance outcomes to also examine numerous outcomes related to health care utilization. These outcomes will include frequency of and expenditures on: physician and non-physician office visits; inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room hospital visits; and prescription drugs. We will also examine total medical expenditures from all categories. For the expenditure outcomes, we will further subdivide by payer, including out-of-pocket, private insurance, and Medicaid. We will also conduct subsample analyses by age, race/ethnicity, education, income, gender, marital status, and presence of children in the home. Using these results, we will compute the extent to which the ACA reduced disparities on the bases of race/ethnicity and socio- economic status in both Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states. Finally, we will estimate instrumental variables models to determine the impacts of private coverage and Medicaid coverage on the various outcomes. Project Narrative/Relevance The Affordable Care Act (ACA) aimed to achieve nearly universal coverage in the United States through a combination of insurance market reforms, mandates, subsidies, and Medicaid expansions. This proposed research will investigate the impacts of the ACA on the health care utilization of non-elderly adults.

"Machine Learning for Health Outcomes and Quality of Care in Low-Income  Populations PROJECT SUMMARY: Life expectancy and other health outcomes in the United States are associated with income and socioeconomic status. Low-income populations have poorer health outcomes and, unlike high-income populations, outcomes also vary by geography. While these relationships have been described for decades in prior literature, the underlying mechanisms of these connections have not been identified. Understanding the determinants of such health disparities is critical to improving health outcomes and preventing disease. The impact of health insurance on health outcomes in low-income populations is unknown, as it has not been studied empirically on a national scale. The proposed research will be the first ever study to employ randomization of health plans in Medicaid, the government insurance program for individuals who lack resources to pay for health care. We will establish the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes in low-income populations. This will involve a novel data source containing enrollment and health care utilization information for the universe of low-income households in Massachusetts from 2006 to 2015. We are uniquely positioned to study the effect of Medicaid and type of Medicaid coverage as our data contains enrollees who were randomly assigned to plans and those who were not. These data are linked to important health outcomes, including cause of death, birth weight, and APGAR scores. We will additionally exploit our partial random assignment to examine effect modification by quality of care. Disparities exist in quality of care along income lines, and low-income populations tend to have lower quality scores. To accomplish these goals, we propose the creation of a nonparametric machine learning framework for generalizing results from experimental and quasi-experimental studies. This flexible robust methodology will be developed and tailored for our study of health disparities in order to generalize results from within-state studies to i) the full population of low-income individuals within a state and ii) populations of low-income individuals in other states. With average monthly Medicaid enrollment of over 55 million individuals across the country, this project will have significant broad impacts on low-income populations. Our findings and new analytic tools will provide foundational understanding of the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes among low-income populations, including any effect modification by quality of care. Unraveling the complicated relationships between insurance and health outcomes in low-income populations is an essential component toward improving these outcomes. The lack of randomization in most public health studies on disparities has contributed to diverging results and confusion around interpretation for health policy. The development of our machine learning framework for the generalizability of population health studies is innovative as it will revolutionize the ability of researchers to assess the effects of health exposures and interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Health outcomes and quality of care in low-income populations lag behind other groups, and the impact of health insurance on these disparities among low-income individuals is currently unknown. The goal of this proposal is to examine the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes in low-income populations with rigorous new tools in partially randomized data.

"Improving Minority Health by Monitoring Medicaid Quality, Disparities and Value PROJECT SUMMARY Treating individuals with schizophrenia requires a broad array of services, including physical health care services, which are primarily financed by Medicaid. Despite high health care costs, most patients do not receive recommended care, and minorities are less likely to do so than whites. Moreover, where patients live matters, with quality and quality disparities varying not just among states but also among counties within states. At a time of reform and fiscal constraint, Medicaid programs are challenged with improving quality and reducing quality disparities among high-needs beneficiaries, including those with schizophrenia, at no extra costs. Factors likely to impact a program’s success include its ability to 1) comprehensively measure quality of care, capturing key domains of both mental health and physical health care, 2) validly and feasibly measure the value of care routinely delivered to their beneficiaries, and importantly, 3) incorporate racial/ethnic disparities in the assessment of value. Such measurement efforts should be undertaken at the level of meaningful geographic units such as counties, where patterns of health care are influenced by policies reflecting both state and local priorities. In response to FOA 16-221, we propose a program of research that seeks to reduce health disparities and improve the health of minority populations served in publicly funded settings through measurement of quality disparities and other critical domains of Medicaid-financed care delivered to adults with schizophrenia living in five diverse states. We will measure quality using evidence- based indicators, and exploiting psychometric principles, we will create an overall composite score as well as key sub-scores. Using the composite measure, we will assess racial/ethnic and geographic disparities in overall quality of care; value, defined as the cost to the Medicaid state program of producing high-quality care; and the cost to the program of eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in quality. We will integrate quality and costs through a unique cost-effectiveness methodology, and to our knowledge, our work will be the first to quantitatively link disparities and costs of serious mental illness care. Our ultimate goal is to provide policymakers with a user-friendly interactive tool to monitor quality, quality disparities, costs, and value, thus enabling evidence-based policymaking. Aim 1 will assess racial/ethnic and geographic disparities in quality of mental health, physical health, and overall health care routinely delivered to beneficiaries with schizophrenia. Aim 2 will develop and implement a cost-effectiveness framework to assess value, operationalized as the incremental net monetary benefit of care. Aim 3 will use the statewide white population as a reference standard to determine the cost of eliminating racial/ethnic quality disparities in each county. Aim 4 will develop and pilot a user-friendly interactive tool to enable state Medicaid programs to monitor quality, disparities, costs, and value of care. We expect that the proposed research will contribute to the eradication of disparities through advanced performance measurement techniques that will enable routine monitoring of Medicaid care. Project Narrative The proposed research has high public health relevance because (1) we focus on Medicaid beneficiaries with schizophrenia, a seriously ill population for whom access to high-quality care may be transformative, yet poor quality as well as quality disparities can lead to personal and societal suffering, premature mortality, and high costs, and (2) we seek to substantially expand and develop first evidence on overall quality of care, including physical health care; disparities in quality of care, both racial/ethnic and geographic; value of care, or the cost to the Medicaid state program of producing high-quality care; and the costs of eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in quality. Moreover, through the development of a monitoring tool that will be made available to state Medicaid programs, we will enable evidence-based policy-making aimed at improving care for this vulnerable population.","Improving Minority Health by Monitoring Medicaid Quality, Disparities and Value",9470731,R01MD012428,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Budgets ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Sources ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Foundations ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Locales ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Policy Making ', ' Psychometrics ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' State Government ', ' Provincial Government ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Managed Care ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' beneficiary ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' user-friendly ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' routine care ', ' population health ', ' interactive tool ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' ']",NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2017,769534,0.1063541441998683
"Finding Equitable and Effective MTM Eligibility Criteria ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need to improve the Medicare eligibility criteria for medication therapy management (MTM) services in prescription drug (Part D) benefits has been highlighted recently when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released their proposed 2015 rules for Part D plans. In this document, CMS credited our team's series of findings on disparity implications of the current MTM eligibility criteria among the main reasons to change MTM eligibility. Combining medication review and treatment planning, MTM services were implemented by CMS in 2006 as a part of Part D based on the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) and have been shown to significantly improve pharmacotherapy outcomes. MTM services are long overdue because drug-related morbidity/mortality is an age-old and costly public health problem, particularly among the elderly. However, as we have shown, Medicare MTM eligibility criteria are an institutionalized cause for disparities: the drug use/cost basis of MTM eligibility means that racial and ethnic minorities are less likely to qualif because, given the same health status, Blacks and Hispanics tend to use fewer drugs/incur lower drug costs than Whites. The recently proposed 2015 MTM eligibility criteria merely lower the drug use/cost thresholds within MMA statutory framework, and, thus, are unlikely to address these disparities. Moreover, MMA MTM eligibility criteria recently were found ineffective in capturing suboptimal-therapy problems such as drug nonadherence.  The goal of this project is to address these issues by finding equitable and effective MTM eligibility criteria. ""Effectiveness is essential for realizing MTM's potential, and ""equality of access"" is the most widely- used definition of equity in policy documents. Specific Aim 1: To test whether using Star Ratings criteria, which we propose based on the medication safety/adherence measures in the CMS Part D Star Ratings system, can reduce racial and ethnic disparities in MTM eligibility. Specific Aim 2: To compare the effectiveness of the MTM eligibility criteria under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and MMA in identifying patients with medication utilization issues. We will compare them on sensitivity, specificity, predictive values (positive/negative), and the receiver operating characteristic curves. ACA MTM eligibility criteria are important to analyze, as recognized by CMS, because these criteria incorporate medication utilization issues within the MMA MTM eligibility framework. Specific Aim 3: To examine the comparative effectiveness of the MTM eligibility criteria under ACA and MMA in identifying medication utilization issues across racial and ethnic groups. We will also examine predictors for disparities and conduct disease-specific analyses. We will use 2013 Medicare Part D data linked to Parts A and B claims, the Master Beneficiary Summary File, and the Area Health Resource File. This project's success is highly likely because our pilot data suggest that minorities may be as likely as Whites to meet the Star Ratings Criteria. The National Institute on Aging identifies disparities/medication utilization issues among Medicare beneficiaries as a funding priority. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Medication therapy management (MTM) services are part of the outpatient prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries implemented by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2006 with a goal to ""optimize therapeutic outcomes through improved medication use...""

"Insurance Instability and Disparities in Chronic Disease Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial and ethnic health disparities in the processes and outcomes of chronic disease care are pervasive, well documented, and consistently linked to health insurance coverage. Insurance instability (the frequency of switches in insurance coverage or gaps without coverage), may contribute to disparities in outcomes of chronic disease care. With the explicit goal of reducing disparities, Massachusetts (MA) Health Insurance Reform has now extended comprehensive health insurance coverage to 98% of the state's residents, with disproportionately greater gains in coverage among racial/ethnic minorities and the poor. To examine if MA insurance reform has lessened health disparities through increased insurance stability, our specific aims are: Aim 1: To examine changes in insurance instability pre- and post-reform, overall and comparing racial/ethnic specific minority populations to whites. We hypothesize that (a) Insurance instability decreased in the post-reform period and (c) Insurance instability decreased more for racial/ethnic minorities. Aim 2: To examine whether patients receiving care post-insurance reform had better processes of chronic disease management and improved health outcomes, compared with patients receiving care pre-insurance reform, and whether such patterns vary by race/ethnicity. We hypothesize that improvements in processes and outcomes of chronic disease management were greater among racial/ethnic minorities who benefited the most from insurance reform, resulting in reduced disparities. Aim 3: To assess whether patients with more favorable insurance stability had better processes of chronic disease care and improved health outcomes compared to patients with less favorable insurance stability, and whether racial/ethnic minority patients experienced disproportionately greater gains. We hypothesize that greater insurance stability will be associated with improved processes and outcomes of chronic disease management, resulting in reduced disparities. We will conduct an innovative study to assess the processes and outcomes of care for six highly prevalent, chronic conditions before and after the implementation of MA Health Insurance Reform. These conditions are diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We will utilize existing electronic medical records on over 110,000 subjects from Boston Medical Center and eight of its affiliated federally qualified Community Health Centers, the largest safety net institution in New England that serves African American and Hispanic communities, and Tufts Medical Center, which serves a large Asian American community in Boston's Chinatown. When the study is completed, we will provide empiric data on the direct impact of insurance reform and insurance instability on health disparities in multiple populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We seek to determine the effectiveness of Massachusetts Health Insurance Reform on reducing disparities in processes and outcomes of chronic conditions among Boston's vulnerable populations. We will analyze the impact of insurance reform and insurance coverage stability on the care of African American, Hispanic, and Asian patients who receive care at Tufts Medical Center and Boston Medical Center and its affiliated health centers for six conditions: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, congestive heart failure, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

"The Effects of Accountable Care Organizations on Health Care Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) are being pursued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as a means to rein in health care cost growth while improving quality of care, but little is known about how ACO efforts to improve health care efficiency might affect health care equity. In this context, the candidate (Dr. Valerie A. Lewis) seeks to understand how ACOs affect racial and socioeconomic disparities in health care outcomes. The candidate, a sociologist and health services researcher at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, will leverage this application to develop her research agenda and develop into an independent investigator. During the period of support, she will pursue didactic instruction in several disciplines, including training in clinical conditions and organizational behavior along with leadership development. She will also have ample opportunity for mentored, project-based learning, including developing advanced understanding of how to measure quality of care. The proposed research plan has three aims: Aim 1. To examine Medicare ACO coverage across patient race and socioeconomic status. Dr. Lewis will use Medicare claims data to examine whether disadvantaged patients are more or less likely than other patients to receive care from ACO providers compared to non-ACO providers and will examine the relative effects of (a) patterns of provider participation in ACOs and (b) patient selection. She will then use the National Survey of ACOs to determine if disadvantaged ACO patients are cared for at ACOs that are systematically different from other ACOs (e.g., types of ACO providers or services, ACO capabilities). Aim 2. To examine how Medicare ACO programs impact disparities in patient care outcomes. Dr. Lewis will use longitudinal Medicare claims data to examine how Medicare ACO programs affect disparities in quality outcomes over time. Analysis will focus on the extent to which changes in disparities are a result of differences withi providers (e.g., all ACO providers improve care for disadvantaged groups) or across providers (e.g., providers serving disadvantaged patients make rapid improvements under ACO programs). Aim 3. To understand how organizational characteristics, capabilities, and strategies influence changing disparities over time under Medicare ACO programs. Dr. Lewis will examine how and why organizational characteristics and capabilities influence changing disparities under ACO models. She will use data from the National Survey of ACOs to explore how ACOs' organizational characteristics (e.g., partnership structure, governance, capabilities) and implementation strategy (e.g., care management programs, physician feedback mechanisms) affect changes in disparities over time. Finally, she will follow up with in-depth interviews to understand how organizational characteristics may be detrimental or beneficial to changing disparities in care. Findings from this project will inform policymakers and implementers about how the ACO model can best facilitate improved health care equity alongside important goals of increased efficiency. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) hold the promise of reducing health care costs while improving quality, but little is known about how these initiatives may affect disparities in health care outcomes by race or socioeconomic status.

"Reproductive care in the safety net: Women's health after Affordable Care Act implementation (EVERYWOMAN) PROJECT SUMMARY Evidence-based reproductive care decreases morbidity and mortality for women and their children, reduces disparities, and saves money; however, many women do not receive needed reproductive care. Cost and lack of health insurance are known barriers to receiving care, and women who are poor and representative of racial and/or ethnic minorities are least likely to receive needed reproductive care. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) prioritized reproductive health care as an essential component of women's clinical preventive services and called for every state to significantly expand Medicaid coverage by 2014. Little is yet known about how ACA Medicaid expansions are impacting the delivery of reproductive health care. The 2012 United States (US) Supreme Court ruling that made ACA Medicaid expansions optional for states created a natural experiment to answer this important question. As of January, 2016, 31 states and the District of Columbia had expanded Medicaid, while 19 states had not. We will use this unprecedented natural experiment to study the impact of the ACA and Medicaid expansion on the provision of women's reproductive health care in community health centers (CHCs). The proposed Reproductive care in the safety net: Women's health after Affordable Care Act implementation (EVERYWOMAN) project is a mixed-methods study that will leverage patient-level electronic health record (EHR) data from two CHC networks: the Community Health Applied Research Network (CHARN) and the ADVANCE clinical data research network (CDRN). Together, the CHARN and ADVANCE research data warehouses have patient-level data on over 3 million patients from CHCs across 26 states (14 expansion and 12 non-expansion states). These data will be augmented through qualitative data on patient and provider perceptions of the impact of the ACA on reproductive health care in low-income and vulnerable populations. The specific aims are as follows:  Aim 1: Describe provision of women's reproductive health care before and after implementation of the  ACA and between expansion and non-expansion states.  Aim 2: Identify individual, clinic, and state-level factors associated with provision of women's  reproductive health care.  Aim 3: Understand provider and patient perceptions of the provision and utilization of reproductive  health care in low-income and vulnerable populations. This project builds on our team's experience in insurance, primary care, women's health, and utilizing EHR clinical data for research. The ADVANCE and CHARN datasets position us uniquely to study national-level impacts of the ACA. Findings will be relevant to policy and practice, informing efforts to enhance the provision of timely, evidence-based reproductive care, improve health outcomes, and reduce disparities among low- income vulnerable populations of women. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite evidence demonstrating that evidence-based reproductive health care decreases morbidity and mortality for women and their children, reduces disparities, and saves money, many women do not receive needed reproductive health care services, and women who are poor and representative of racial and/or ethnic minorities are least likely to receive needed care. By expanding access to Medicaid and prioritizing women's preventive services, including reproductive health care, the Affordable Care Act has the potential to significantly enhance the provision of reproductive health care, especially in low-income and underserved populations served by community health centers. The proposed project is a mixed-methods study that will leverage patient-level electronic health record (EHR) data from two community health center networks [the Community Health Applied Research Network (CHARN) and the ADVANCE clinical data research network], augmented through qualitative data to explore if and how the ACA and Medicaid expansion have impacted the provision and utilization of reproductive health care services in community health center settings.",Reproductive care in the safety net: Women's health after Affordable Care Act implementation (EVERYWOMAN),9287811,R01HS025155,[''],AHRQ,"OCHIN, INC.",R01,2017,399634,0.09156959957566184
"ACCESS: Assessing Community Cancer care after insurance ExpanSionS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer morbidity and mortality is greatly reduced through screening and prevention, but uninsured patients are much less likely than insured patients to receive these evidence-based services as recommended. Similarly, uninsured cancer survivors receive fewer primary and preventive care services than those with health insurance. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) called for every state to significantly expand Medicaid coverage by 2014; it is hypothesized that the ACA's Medicaid expansions could substantially (i) improve access to essential cancer preventive and screening services for previously uninsured patients, and (ii) facilitate better access to routine healthcare among cancer survivors who gain new health insurance. Little is yet known about how ACA Medicaid expansions are impacting the delivery of recommended cancer care. The 2012 United States (US) Supreme Court ruling that made ACA Medicaid expansions optional for states created a natural experiment to answer this important question. As of April 1, 2015, 30 states and the District of Columbia had expanded Medicaid, while 20 states had not. We will use this unprecedented natural experiment to study the effect of state-level Medicaid expansions on rates of cancer screening, cancer preventive services, and healthcare for cancer survivors. We will use electronic health record (EHR) data from the ADVANCE clinical data research network, which has data from 718 community health centers (CHCs), including 476 CHCs in 13 Medicaid expansion states and 242 CHCs in 8 non-expansion states. From this dataset, we will collect detailed information on changes in health insurance and healthcare service receipt, with data spanning 9 years (pre- and post-expansion), comparing states that expanded Medicaid, and those that did not. The specific aims are as follows: Aim 1. Compare pre-post receipt of cancer prevention and screening among CHC patients in Medicaid expansion versus non-expansion states. Aim 2. Compare pre-post insurance status, visits, and receipt of routine, recommended primary and preventive care among cancer survivors seen in CHCs in expansion versus non-expansion states. Aim 3. Compare pre-post cancer prevention, screening, and survivor care for newly insured (gained Medicaid in post-period), already insured (had Medicaid coverage in pre- and post-periods), and continuously uninsured (no coverage in pre- and post-periods) CHC patients in states that expanded Medicaid. This project builds on our team's experience studying health insurance, primary care, and receipt of preventive services. The ADVANCE dataset positions us uniquely to study national-level impacts of the ACA. Importantly, this project aligns with National Cancer Institute (NCI) goals to increase knowledge regarding cancer control and prevention. According to the NCI, ""prevention has the potential to save more lives from cancer than treatment...which underlines the importance of strongly supporting this research area."" Also, findings will be relevant to policy and practice, and will inform further improvements in the US healthcare system to mitigate disparities in cancer prevention and survivor care for vulnerable populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Some states implemented Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansions while other states did not, thus creating a natural experiment to study the impact of increased access to health insurance on cancer screening, cancer preventive services, and cancer survivor care. This innovative, timely study will use electronic health record (EHR) data from the ADVANCE clinical data research network (CDRN) of PCORnet, which has EHR data from 718 community health centers (CHCs), including 476 CHCs in 13 states that expanded Medicaid (n=576,711 patients), and 242 CHCs in 8 states that did not expand Medicaid (n=361,421 patients).

"Medicaid Expansion in Oregon:  Access and Health Outcomes for Women and Infants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early intervention to identify and treat chronic disease and modify behavioral risk factors among women of reproductive age has the potential to significantly reduce their morbidity and mortality and improve their pregnancy outcomes. Lack of health insurance has been a major barrier to early intervention and preventive care among low-income women of reproductive age. However, the 2014 expansion of Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) will make millions of low-income women newly eligible for Medicaid and preventive health services. An integrated data system is essential to evaluate the impact of this expansion on the health of women of reproductive age and their infants. Research using this data system will inform future program planning and identify best practices and areas of greatest need. We propose to create an integrated data system that links Oregon Medicaid data with birth and death certificates and hospital discharge data. Further, we will include data on the quality of Medicaid services that are not available to other states. The proposed study is a collaborative effort between Oregon State University and the Oregon Health Authority. Oregon is an ideal state in which to conduct the proposed study because of its ongoing commitment to Medicaid health care delivery reform and the commitment of state leaders to collaborate across divisions and programs to ensure this project's success. The project also has the support of key state stakeholders in maternal and child health and women's health. The specific aims of the proposal are to1) develop a research agenda, in collaboration with key stakeholders, to evaluate the expansion of Medicaid on the health of Medicaid-eligible women of reproductive age, mothers, and infants in Oregon; 2) link Oregon Medicaid data for female enrollees ages 15-44 and their infants to statewide datasets, including (but not limited to) live birth, fetal death, infant death, and hospital discharge data, beginning with 2008 and continuing until 2016, as data become available; and 3) conduct planned analyses and disseminate findings. The research agenda will include key research questions that assess the effect of Medicaid expansion on Medicaid enrollment and access to care for low-income women; utilization of services by women and infants enrolled in Medicaid; general health behaviors, risks, and outcomes for these women; and pregnancy complications and poor birth outcomes. We will also measure disparities that remain after Medicaid expansion, to inform strategies to mitigate those disparities on an ongoing basis. We will use results of these analyses to construct simulations that extend this study's findings into implications and lessons for policy makers and stakeholders in other states that are expanding Medicaid. Results of these analyses and simulations will provide valuable information to support health reform efforts, both in Oregon and across the U.S, to reduce the public health burden and improve population health among women of reproductive age, including pregnancy and infant health outcomes. Project Narrative The collaborative research team will create an integrated, state-level data system that links Medicaid data with other existing data sets. Analyses will be conducted that will provide valuable evidence on the impact of Medicaid expansion in Oregon and across the US. Findings may be used to improve access to health care services and health outcomes among Medicaid-eligible women and their children.",Medicaid Expansion in Oregon:  Access and Health Outcomes for Women and Infants,9314233,U01DP004783,[''],NCCDPHP,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,250000,0.1412024080438288
"Effects of federal parity legislationon access to drug, alcohol, and mental health treatment ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Historically, insurance coverage for drug, alcohol, and mental health (DAMH) care has been more limited than coverage for other forms of general health care. For decades, insurers defended this difference with arguments that equal coverage for DAMH care would lead to excessive use and high costs. More restrictive coverage has contributed over time to a large treatment gap in which most people in need of DAMH care have not received it. For those who have received care, financial protection has tended to be weaker. Since the 1990s, a series of state and federal laws have attempted to regulate insurance and mandate DAMH parity. One of the most comprehensive efforts has been the 2008 Paul Wellstone & Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity & Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA). This federal law seeks to strengthen private insurance coverage for DAMH care, but its effectiveness to date remains largely unknown. The purpose of this project is: (1) to investigate the effects of MHPAEA on how people access and pay for DAMH care; and (2) to measure racial/ethnic disparities in access to DAMH care and assess how MHPAEA has affected them. Principles of health economics predict MHPAEA will improve financial protection for DAMH care recipients, reducing uncertainty about out-of-pocket expenses and limiting risk for high, potentially catastrophic costs. Another less probable outcome is that MHPAEA will increase DAMH treatment rates as better coverage makes care more affordable. According to the Institute of Medicine model of health care disparities, however, institutional factors and discrimination may intervene to perpetuate and potentially deepen racial/ethnic disparities in access to DAMH care despite the new protections afforded by MHPAEA. To research these issues, this study will employ a quasi-experimental design using secondary analysis of existing data. Difference-in-differences models will be fit with pooled independent cross sections of survey data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2004-2013. Treatment rates and payment sources will be compared pre- and post-MHPAEA, testing multiple time-points post-MHPAEA to detect effects of staggered implementation. Survey respondents with private insurance will be compared to those with public sources of insurance and those without insurance. Generalized linear mixed models will be estimated to allow for analysis of individual-level observations clustered within states. The proposed research will produce preliminary empirical evidence on the effectiveness of MHPAEA. Results will be representative at state and national levels. Findings will contribute to an improved understanding of the role health insurance plays in determining how consumers access DAMH care. Findings may also inform future efforts to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in DAMH care and the overall DAMH treatment gap. As other research assesses the effects of the 2010 Affordable Care Act on access to DAMH treatment, the proposed study will provide a strong baseline evidence upon which to build.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Access to quality, affordable health care is a key factor in reducing the prevalence and impact of substance use disorders and mental illness in our society. Health insurance plays a crucial role in determining whether individuals with drug, alcohol, and mental health problems are able to access the care they need. This study will produce preliminary evidence about the effectiveness of a 2008 federal law intended to improve private health insurance coverage for drug, alcohol, and mental health treatment by mandating parity with coverage for comparable forms of medical care.        ","Effects of federal parity legislationon access to drug, alcohol, and mental health treatment",9324694,F31DA040402,"['Affect ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Awareness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Planning ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Benefits ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Laws ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' parity ', ' Play ', ' Privatization ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' total medical expenditure ', ' medical expenses not covered by insurance ', ' Uncovered Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' Uncovered Medical Expenses ', ' Out-of-Pocket Expense ', ' Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Respondent ', ' cooking ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Side ', ' Source ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Services ', ' health care model ', ' payment ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Science Policy ', ' trend ', ' cost ', ' consumer demand ', ' health economics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' care recipients ', ' care receiver ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' Health Care Research ', ' healthcare research ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NIDA,BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,29032,0.05037254101947768
"Integrating Social Determinants of Health Into Risk Adjustment Models:  An Opportunity to Improve Care Coordination Strategies For Medicaid Beneficiaries PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this project is to provide evidence of the value of measuring social determinants of health (SDH) in the Medicaid population. This project will demonstrate that risk stratification using traditional risk adjustment models (RAMs) can be improved significantly with the inclusion of SDH information in addition to the information these models typically rely on: age, gender, and medical diagnoses. In addition, this project will quantify incident and cumulative risk of various SDH factors on the onset of incident disease within a one year period, highlighting the need to address social and environmental disadvantages that drive health inequities so that Medicaid can achieve the triple aim: improved care and population health at lower cost. To accomplish our objectives, we will conduct a prospective cohort study that will enroll 9,600 adult Medicaid beneficiaries treated at two medical facilities located in Washington, DC. The study sample will be predominately black (i.e. 90%) with a slightly higher percentage of females (60%). Medicaid beneficiaries who participate will complete a comprehensive SDH assessment during their initial medical encounter that will include validated SDH questions that measure housing stability, food availability, financial strain, health behaviors, social support, etc. Six and 12 months after enrollment, we will conduct a telephone follow-up interview with subjects to determine if there have been any major changes to their social and environmental circumstances. We will merge the interview data with DC Medicaid claims data (two years pre and one year post enrollment date). We will use the prior claims data to characterize health care utilization and expenditures by: (1) different types of service (i.e., inpatient care, outpatient care, prescription drugs, etc); (2) acute versus chronic treatments; and (3) preventable versus non preventable. We will risk stratify the study sample using three RAMs (i.e., Chronic Disability and Payment System, The Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACG) System, and 3M Clinical Risk Groups (CRGs). We will compare predictions of next year's health care utilization and expenditures for each RAM using generalized linear models that include or exclude SDH variables. We will also quantify the incident and cumulative risk associated with different SDH factors on disease onset during a one year follow-up period using generalized estimating equation models. To reduce the large health inequities that exist in the Medicaid population, this project aims to demonstrate the critical need to measure and address SDH in our care delivery strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to demonstrate the utility of measuring social determinants of health (SDH) in the Medicaid population.

"Effect of School-Based Health Centers on Reducing Students Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in 5 persons in poverty is a child <18 years, and this number is growing, especially in the South. Further, 40% of African American and 34% of Hispanic children <18 years live in low-income households, and 55% of poor rural African-American children have less access to health services. Since a majority of public school students are from low-income families in both the South and West, public schools present an opportunity to reach underserved populations on-site with quality healthcare services. For > 2 decades model School-based Health Centers (SBHCs) have been tested to meet health needs of disparity population, but less than 1% of public elementary schools house SBHCs. Four issues must be addressed in taking SBHCs to scale: sustainability, evidence of community need and support, evidence of health and health cost impact, and fidelity to exemplar models. The ongoing Georgia SBHC Project provides operational solutions to the first two issues. The goal of the proposed study, EPOCH (Evaluating Processes and Outcomes for Children), will take advantage of an opportunity to conduct a ""natural experiment"" that will assess the ability of this approach to solve the other two issues. We will examine the effects of expanding SBHCs across three public elementary school sites in Georgia that differ by environment (rural, small city, and suburban) and race / ethnicity (one each being predominantly African American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white children). A specific focus will be the effects of SBHCs on improved access to primary care and, in turn, on the level of health outcomes including obesity, uncontrolled asthma, and Emergency Department and hospital utilization and costs to the Medicaid program. We will conduct a year-by-year comparison of health indicators and health care costs for children with and without access to SBHCs. In a novel approach to evaluating SBHCs, we will conduct a full-scale process and outcome evaluation, following the Implementation Fidelity model proposed by Carroll, et al., and modified by Hasson. This will include active monitoring to measure program adaptations, secondary analysis of SBHCs' benchmarking, schools' routine FitnessGrams and absenteeism statistics, and by linking children enrolled in an SBHC to their Medicaid claims records. This quasi-experimental, longitudinal study will include 7 years' data (3 pre-, 1 during, and 3 post-SBHC implementation) for the 3 SBHC schools and 3 similar, non-SBHC schools. Additionally, Medicaid data will be extracted for children living in the 6 schools' zip codes to conduct utilization and cost analyses on improving specific health outcomes (e.g., asthma and obesity) and reducing health disparities in rural and minority populations. The EPOCH study offers an opportunity to create a new evidence base for the role of SBHCs in states without the Medicaid expansion. Comprehensive SBHCs may have greater importance there because of the lack of alternatives for children to access free or subsidized health care. These findings will also inform the nation as it considers reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in 2015. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal for the proposed research is to evaluate the effectiveness of school-based health centers (SBHCs) in reducing disparities in obesity and asthma and improving school attendance in the low income child populations of the southeast. We can also measure health costs benefits to Medicaid during the first years of the Affordable Care Act.

"Using Satellite National Health Accounts to Understand Health and Cost Changes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Though health expenditures in the U.S. are carefully tracked by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the health outcomes associated with these expenditures are not. To address this need, our past research has developed detailed measures of population health and medical spending using existing national data, in order to systematically and jointly measure the benefits and the costs of medical care. These methods have been developed to serve as a Satellite National Health Account, enabling a better understanding of the health sector in the United States. We propose two new avenues of analysis using these tools that will greatly expand our understanding of health change in relation to costs across the U.S. population. The first is to examine health in conjunction with costs among all age groups- -including the elderly, middle-aged, young adults, and children-and among different socioeconomic groups. The second is to examine the health of those with different diseases, and understand specifically how it has changed over time in terms of the relationship of each disease to health and medical spending. A major output of the project is the production of a satellite National Health Account for the U.S. population as a whole, that gives critical information on health outcomes and medical expenditures for specific diseases over time, overall and among different sociodemographic groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will result in a National Health Account for the whole U.S. population, providing detailed information on health in conjunction with medical expenditures-overall, among those with different diseases, and in different socioeconomic groups.

"Machine Learning for Health Outcomes and Quality of Care in Low-Income Populations PROJECT SUMMARY: Life expectancy and other health outcomes in the United States are associated with income and socioeconomic status. Low-income populations have poorer health outcomes and, unlike high-income populations, outcomes also vary by geography. While these relationships have been described for decades in prior literature, the underlying mechanisms of these connections have not been identified. Understanding the determinants of such health disparities is critical to improving health outcomes and preventing disease. The impact of health insurance on health outcomes in low-income populations is unknown, as it has not been studied empirically on a national scale. The proposed research will be the first ever study to employ randomization of health plans in Medicaid, the government insurance program for individuals who lack resources to pay for health care. We will establish the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes in low-income populations. This will involve a novel data source containing enrollment and health care utilization information for the universe of low-income households in Massachusetts from 2006 to 2015. We are uniquely positioned to study the effect of Medicaid and type of Medicaid coverage as our data contains enrollees who were randomly assigned to plans and those who were not. These data are linked to important health outcomes, including cause of death, birth weight, and APGAR scores. We will additionally exploit our partial random assignment to examine effect modification by quality of care. Disparities exist in quality of care along income lines, and low-income populations tend to have lower quality scores. To accomplish these goals, we propose the creation of a nonparametric machine learning framework for generalizing results from experimental and quasi-experimental studies. This flexible robust methodology will be developed and tailored for our study of health disparities in order to generalize results from within-state studies to i) the full population of low-income individuals within a state and ii) populations of low-income individuals in other states. With average monthly Medicaid enrollment of over 55 million individuals across the country, this project will have significant broad impacts on low-income populations. Our findings and new analytic tools will provide foundational understanding of the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes among low-income populations, including any effect modification by quality of care. Unraveling the complicated relationships between insurance and health outcomes in low-income populations is an essential component toward improving these outcomes. The lack of randomization in most public health studies on disparities has contributed to diverging results and confusion around interpretation for health policy. The development of our machine learning framework for the generalizability of population health studies is innovative as it will revolutionize the ability of researchers to assess the effects of health exposures and interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Health outcomes and quality of care in low-income populations lag behind other groups, and the impact of health insurance on these disparities among low-income individuals is currently unknown. The goal of this proposal is to examine the role of insurance coverage on health outcomes in low-income populations with rigorous new tools in partially randomized data.

"Epidemiology, Exploration and Evaluation: Addressing potentially dangerous medications in Medicaid children with a mental health diagnosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental health diagnoses are common in pediatric practice. Abundant evidence demonstrates that many medications used to treat children with mental health conditions are prescribed in circumstances or combinations for which they are not recommended. Such use may lead to patient harms such as onset of diabetes or suicidal ideation, and potentially avoidable emergency department visits and hospitalizations. This project proposes (1) to describe in detail the epidemiology of patient safety in ambulatory care settings, focusing on medication safety in children with mental health diagnoses who are enrolled in New York State Medicaid ; (2) to assess the extent to which three strategies: a) receipt of primary care in a National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)-recognized patient-centered medical home (PCMH); b) a new state policy (""carve-in"") that assigns responsibility to manage the prescription pharmaceutical insurance benefit to managed care plans rather than the state Medicaid program; and c) a more patient-centered, comprehensive set of medication reconciliation (med rec) practices can reduce potentially dangerous medication use or undesirable consequences / patient harms in this populations; and (3) to assess whether or not a state Department of Health quality department's implementation of a survey to assess medication reconciliation in practices throughout Medicaid is an effective way to enhance the performance of such practices. The epidemiological study will use cross sectional, univariate, bivariate, and multivariable analyses for each year from 2014 to 2017, including logistic regression and regression risk analysis. It will look at clinical, patient, contextual, and practice characteristics that are associated with lower and higher uses of potentially dangerous medication practices and undesirable outcomes. It will describe identified disparities, considering characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity, rural/urban residence, foster care status, and level of poverty in the home county. A propensity score analysis will help to assess the association of the specified medication practices with undesirable outcomes and patient harm. Assessment of the PCMH and med rec strategies will utilize propensity score analyses that are modified from the models developed during the epidemiological analysis. The state carve-in policy, implemented in late 2011, will be assessed using a segmented regression analysis of an interrupted time series from 2008 to 2016.=Medication reconciliation practice will be assessed using a survey instrument developed by an AHRQ- CMS CHIPRA Center of Excellence in the federal Pediatric Quality Measures Program. The impact of measurement on med rec practices will be assessed using a cluster randomized trial with a stepped wedge design, surveying one third of practices in all years, on third in years two and three and one thir in year three only. This project promises to provide more detailed insight both into an important patient safety risk in ambulatory settings for a vulnerable population and also into how well several strategies reduce risk in real world settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal addresses several key public health concerns: the safe and unsafe use of medication in children who are in Medicaid who have been diagnosed with at least one mental health condition; the impact of clinical and policy approaches that have been suggested as possibly making care safer through improved medication practices; and the description of both the current state and the evolution over the course of the grant of medication reconciliation practices by clinical practices. Medication reconciliation is a series of policies and practices that are intended to make medication use safer by enhancing coordination between patients/families, and the variety of clinicians who are taking care of them. Our multidisciplinary team will describe the detailed epidemiology of potentially unsafe medication practices and undesirable outcomes for these children in New York State Medicaid; assess the impact of the patient-centered medical home, of medication reconciliation practices and of a statewide policy change that assigns responsibility of the management of drug insurance benefits to managed care vendors; and will look at whether or not monitoring practices for medication reconciliation practices increases the performance of desirable practices.","Epidemiology, Exploration and Evaluation: Addressing potentially dangerous medications in Medicaid children with a mental health diagnosis",9353754,R01HS024433,[''],AHRQ,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,497247,0.04657532887021482
"Impact of Medicare Part D Coverage Gap Closure on Health Outcomes The Affordable Care Act (ACA) included provisions to gradually close the Medicare Part D coverage gap (or “doughnut hole”) for prescription drugs. Starting in 2011, drug manufacturers began offering a 50% discount on all brand name drugs for individuals in the coverage gap. Between 2011 and 2020, government subsidies for both brand name and generic drugs will slowly fill in remaining parts of the gap. The coverage gap has led to significant decreases in medication adherence for patients with chronic illness, which has, in turn, resulted in uncontrolled symptoms and adverse health outcomes. As the policy goes into effect, the total annual cost of purchasing medications will decrease for individuals that would have reached the gap under the old policy, which could lead to significant improvements in adherence and health outcomes. Two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries have multiple chronic conditions, and often require treatment with many costly medications. Treatment presents unique challenges in minority patients, who have a higher prevalence of chronic illness, and often require more medications and costlier medications in order to manage their conditions. In this study, we plan to examine whether the closure of the coverage gap leads to real-world improved adherence and health outcomes. Using a 5% national sample of Medicare Claims data from 2006-2017, we will examine the impact of the coverage gap closure on: 1) anticipatory behavior measured by medication adherence across benefit phases and drug types, 2) non-pharmacy healthcare utilization and outcomes and 3) whether the policy led to differential outcomes for racial and ethnic minorities. Our study will use a difference-in-differences approach with nonparametric matching, comparing the impact of the policy between those who previously had coverage in the gap, and those who faced standard benefits. Beneficiaries who received low-income subsidies did not face a coverage gap, and thus will not have any change in benefits as a result of the policy. We will compare these patients to a similar group of near-poor individuals based on a validated census-based SES measure who did not receive subsidies, and thus faced the coverage gap prior to 2010. This study will be the first to examine the impact of the initial coverage gap closure under the ACA, and will provide timely and critical information on the impact how benefit designs with high patient cost sharing influence patient behavior. In addition, we will determine whether the design of the coverage gap resulted in decreases in drug utilization throughout the entire year or only during the coverage gap period, indicating the degree to which individuals are able anticipate future health care spending. This has important implications for understanding behavior under other insurance benefit designs that have different coverage phases (e.g., deductibles, coverage limits). This study will provide important information about how prescription cost-sharing affects healthcare utilization and health outcomes, as well as disparities in these important endpoints, and will provide important information to policy makers about how to design insurance benefits and to lessen the consequences of poor adherence. The closure of the Medicare Part D coverage gap that began in 2011 was intended to provide more comprehensive benefits to Medicare enrollees and to lessen financial strain on those who need to take costly medications. This study will provide important evidence about how much of an impact this policy and similar polices have on medication utilization and health outcomes, as well as disparities in these important endpoints.",Impact of Medicare Part D Coverage Gap Closure on Health Outcomes,9382245,R01AG054424,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Censuses ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Deductibles ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Drug Utilization ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' National Government ', ' Federal Government ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Insurance Benefits ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Morals ', ' Names ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Privatization ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Government Subsidy ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Police ', ' Drug Costs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Services ', ' hazard ', ' Sampling ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Provider ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Compliance behavior ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' compliance cooperation ', ' Treatment Compliance ', ' Patient Cooperation ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Calendar ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' beneficiary ', ' discount ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' service utilization ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Medicare claim ', ' non-drug ', ' nondrug ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' racial minority ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' health difference ', ' differences in health ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2017,562495,0.06933675214885904
"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Health Insurance Coverage Stability: Implications for Chronic Disease Management and Use of Preventive Services Project Summary Unstable health insurance coverage (i.e., gaining and/or losing coverage over time) affects millions of individuals in the US. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has helped 16.4 million of the uninsured gain coverage through the expansion of Medicaid in 31 states (including the District of Columbia as of September 1, 2015) and subsidies through the Health Insurance Exchanges (HIE) and is projected to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in coverage. However, disruptions in coverage may continue to be an important post-ACA issue, as changes in eligibility are expected to continue resulting in churning (i.e., losing and/or gaining coverage over time) between coverage through Medicaid, the HIE and employer-provided health insurance. Despite the abundance of research on the uninsured, little is known about how coverage stability affects access to care, especially in terms of disease management and use of preventive services, and whether important differences exist between racial and ethnic groups. The limited amount of research that does exist on coverage stability have largely been descriptive and have relied on measures that only capture one aspect of coverage stability at a time (e.g., ever lost coverage in the past year). Additionally, few studies have made use of methods that address the influence of unobservable characteristics that may be associated with both coverage stability and access to care (i.e., endogeneity of health insurance coverage). Thus, to address these gaps in the literature, the proposed dissertation will use data on a nationally representative sample of non-elderly adults (ages 18-64) from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to: (1) Construct a coverage stability index measure that encompasses multiple aspects of coverage stability using month-to-month coverage status and principal component analysis; (2) Evaluate the effect of coverage stability on disease management among those living with a chronic condition (i.e., diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol) by race/ethnicity; and (3) Examine the effect of coverage stability on the use of preventive services among the near-elderly (ages 50-64) by race/ethnicity. The proposed project will contribute and improve upon the existing body of research by developing and testing a coverage stability measure that accounts for multiple aspects of the phenomenon, demonstrating the effect of coverage stability on access to care among vulnerable populations and disparities by race/ethnicity, and making use of methods that address the endogeneity of coverage to produce less biased estimates. Such a contribution would bring to light the magnitude of the issue and provoke urgency among policymakers and other stakeholders to engage in discussions and efforts geared towards identifying those at highest risk for unstable coverage and developing strategies that will make coverage transitions less burdensome on access to care, thus alleviating the perpetuation of racial/ethnic disparities in health. Project Narrative Unstable health insurance coverage (i.e., gaining and/or losing coverage over time) affects millions in the US. Although the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has greatly improved access and is projected to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in coverage, disruptions in coverage may continue to be an important post-ACA issue, as changes in eligibility are expected to continue resulting in churning between the different sources of coverage (i.e., Medicaid, the health insurance exchanges, and employer-provided health insurance). The proposed project will contribute to the small albeit growing body of research by developing and testing a multi-dimensional coverage stability measure, demonstrating the effect of coverage stability on access to care among vulnerable populations, determining disparities by race/ethnicity, and using methods that address the endogenity of coverage to produce less biased estimates.",Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Health Insurance Coverage Stability: Implications for Chronic Disease Management and Use of Preventive Services,9379776,R36HS024862,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R36,2017,41931,0.12663599713936186
"Impact of Medicaid Expansion on Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in ESRD Project Summary  The development of end stage renal disease (ESRD) carries devastating implications for patients, including increased morbidity and mortality, lost productivity, and impaired quality of life. The burden of this disease disproportionately falls on the country's most disadvantaged communities. In preliminary work for this grant, we found that 25% of patients aged 19-64 are uninsured at the time of initiating dialysis. This poses a barrier to receiving nephrology care prior to dialysis and initiating dialysis with an arteriovenous fistula rather than a high-risk temporary catheter. Failure to access these pre-dialysis services strongly predicts worse outcomes after dialysis including hospitalizations and death. Further, kidney failure due to diabetes and hypertension (the two most common causes of ESRD) can be prevented or delayed with appropriate blood pressure and glucose control. However, the uninsured have limited ability to finance health services and often forego effective preventive and chronic disease care. Taken together, these findings suggest that expanding health insurance coverage may be a powerful strategy to address disparities in the outcomes with and incidence of kidney failure. But there is limited research to confirm or refute this assertion. Filling this gap in knowledge is critical, since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides states with the option to expand Medicaid coverage to residents with income less than 138% of the Federal Poverty Level. Rigorous empirical evidence about the consequences of expansion, particularly for high-cost, high-need populations, may inform these decisions but are currently unavailable.  Using clinical data from all incident patients with ESRD in the United States from 2009-2018, our specific aims are: 1. Assess the effects of Medicaid expansion on pre-dialysis care for low-income incident populations; 2. Assess the impact of Medicaid expansion on post-dialysis outcomes; and 3. Evaluate early effects of Medicaid expansion on the incidence of ESRD. Our central hypotheses are that Medicaid expansion improved access to recommended pre-dialysis care; reduced hospitalizations and mortality following dialysis; and lowered the incidence of kidney failure, particularly among minority populations and those living in low- income neighborhoods. The proposal is innovative, as we leverage the variation in state Medicaid expansion decisions to test the causal effect of increased Medicaid coverage for a high-risk population. Further, by geocoding patient addresses we will track Census-Tract level outcomes, test alternative approaches for small area estimation, and assess geographic discontinuities across state borders. This project will provide rigorous evidence about the public health and health equity implications of a key feature of the ACA, perhaps the most consequential health care legislation since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. Project Narrative  This project will evaluate the impact of Medicaid expansion on access to effective pre-dialysis care, outcomes following the initiation of dialysis, and the incidence of end stage renal disease. This contribution is significant because reducing disparities in kidney disease is a critical public health priority, and Medicaid expansion may be an effective policy strategy to achieve that goal.",Impact of Medicaid Expansion on Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in ESRD,9288462,R01DK113298,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Arteriovenous Aneurysm ', ' Arteriovenous fistula ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Censuses ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Expenditure ', ' Fistula ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Services ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Medicaid ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nephrology ', ' Patients ', ' Peritoneal Dialysis ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Catheters ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Specialist ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' court ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Failure ', ' Policies ', ' Native Americans ', ' Venous ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Source ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' social ', ' Consequentialism ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Clinical Data ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' glucose regulation ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose control ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Health financing ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' federal poverty level ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' health equity ', ' public health priorities ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIDDK,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,384764,0.09501572671856891
"National estimates of the impact of the affordable care act on healthcare utilization, outcomes and quality among hispanics A central policy assumption in the U.S. today is that expanding health insurance coverage will improve access to health care, improve health outcomes, and make each more equitable for all Americans. Despite its uncertain future, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, ""the most important legislation in health care since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid"", holds great promise for reducing racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare access and population health.  With the objective of evaluating the impact of the 2014 ACA coverage expansion on racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare access, utilization, outcomes and quality, the proposed study has three foci. First, we will examine measures based on actual healthcare inpatient and emergency department (ED) utilization. Second, to better focus on Hispanics, the largest racial/ethnic minority with higher uninsurance rate (41%) than among non-Hispanic whites (15%), non-Hispanic blacks (21%) and Asians (26%), we will develop a near-national database by combining state inpatient discharge data from 22 states that together account for over 88 percent of the national Hispanic population; corresponding ED data is available from a subset of 13 states. Third, far from being an uniform intervention, ACA expansion engendered wide variation in implementation, particularly across states; we will evaluate how reform effects among Hispanics are modified by language barriers, national origin, baseline uninsurance, state Medicaid generosity, and provider availability.  To estimate changes associated with the 2014 ACA insurance expansion by race/ethnicity, we will use a difference-in-differences design, wherein pre-expansion (2010-2013) to post-expansion (2014-2017) changes in the study outcome measures are contrasted with those in a comparison cohort that experienced no insurance expansion. Our specific aims are to estimate the changes associated with ACA coverage expansion in rates of (1) ambulatory care sensitive condition admissions and ED visits, (2) major elective procedures, (3) inpatient mortality and 30-day readmission, and (4) use of safety-net hospitals vs. non- safety-net hospitals, and disparities in such rates by race/ethnicity. We will examine changes in outcomes among subgroups of Hispanics by English language proficiency, national origin, sex and socioeconomic status.  Our proposal has unique strengths: the data used represents a near-national population of Hispanics; it delineates impact across vulnerable subgroups of Hispanics; it identifies the role of potential facilitating and inhibiting factors, such as, provider availability and state Medicaid policy. Despite its uncertain future, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) holds great promise for reducing racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare access and population health. Using administrative inpatient and emergency department data (2010-2017) from 22 states that account for 88% of national Hispanic population, this study will examine the impact of the 2014 ACA coverage expansion on healthcare access, utilization, patient outcomes and quality of care among those aged 19-64, comparing the changes among Hispanics vs. other racial/ethnic groups. It will also evaluate how these effects among Hispanics are modified by sex, national origin, English language proficiency, baseline uninsurance, state Medicaid generosity, and provider availability.","National estimates of the impact of the affordable care act on healthcare utilization, outcomes and quality among hispanics",9522441,R01MD011594,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Future ', ' Gastric Bypass ', ' stomach bypass ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hysterectomy ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Language ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Medicaid ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Measures ', ' National origin ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' knee replacement arthroplasty ', ' total knee arthroplasty ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Elective Surgical Procedures ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' English Language ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' cohort ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' readmission ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' sex ', ' inpatient care ', ' inpatient service ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' population health ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' ']",NIMHD,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,811240,0.12788924795399254
"Evaluating Control of Hypertension - Effect of Social Determinants (ECHOES) Project Summary Hypertension (HTN) is the most common chronic condition among adults in the United States (US). Uninsured adults are more likely to have undiagnosed HTN, less likely to receive regular screening, and less likely to have their HTN under control than insured adults. Prior studies of individual states' Medicaid expansion showed that gaining insurance increased healthcare service utilization, receipt of recommended preventive care, and improved health outcomes; but these studies were limited by having no comparison group. More recently, multiple states were impacted by federal policy changes (e.g., Affordable Care Act [ACA]), creating `natural experiments' to assess whether and how gaining (or losing) health insurance improves HTN prevention and care. Further, there is variability in how states choose to expand or contract coverage, which creates opportunities to identify `intervention' and `control' states (e.g., some states expanded Medicaid eligibility, while others did not). We are well-poised to study the ACA Medicaid expansion natural policy experiment and other policy changes that may unfold in the next few years. In addition, access to care through health insurance may be insufficient to reduce barriers to HTN care. Thus, other social determinants of health ([SDOH]; e.g., individual- and community-level factors) may differentially affect the relationship between gaining insurance and receiving HTN care. We will use electronic health record (EHR) data from the ADVANCE clinical data research network, linked to community-level SDOH, which has data from 599 community health centers (CHCs), including 376 CHCs in 14 Medicaid expansion states (n=1,139,779 patients) and 224 CHCs in 8 non- expansion states (n=658,306 patients). From this dataset, we will collect detailed information on changes in HTN incidence, screening, treatment, and management comparing states that expanded Medicaid, and those that did not. The specific aims are as follows: Aim 1. Compare HTN incidence, prevalence of undiagnosed HTN, and rates of HTN screening, in Medicaid expansion versus non-expansion states before and after the ACA. Aim 2. Compare HTN treatment and management in Medicaid expansion versus non-expansion states, before and after the ACA. Aim 3. Assess the extent to which rates of HTN incidence, screening, and treatment effectiveness among patients who gained insurance versus those continuously insured or uninsured, pre-post ACA, are moderated by individual-level SDOH (e.g., race, ethnicity). Aim 4. Explore the interaction between community-level SDOH (e.g., neighborhood racial segregation and deprivation) and HTN screening, treatment, and management among patients who gained insurance relative to those who were already insured or uninsured, in expansion states. We will build directly on our preliminary work and take advantage of the diverse strengths of our multidisciplinary team. The ADVANCE dataset uniquely positions us to assess current and future natural experiments. Findings will be relevant to policy and practice changes aimed at mitigating disparities in HTN care for vulnerable populations. Project Narrative Some states implemented Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansion while other states did not creating a natural experiment to study the impact of increased access to health insurance on hypertension incidence, screening, treatment, and management.

"The Effects of Accountable Care Organizations on Health Care Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) are being pursued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as a means to rein in health care cost growth while improving quality of care, but little is known about how ACO efforts to improve health care efficiency might affect health care equity. In this context, the candidate (Dr. Valerie A. Lewis) seeks to understand how ACOs affect racial and socioeconomic disparities in health care outcomes. The candidate, a sociologist and health services researcher at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, will leverage this application to develop her research agenda and develop into an independent investigator. During the period of support, she will pursue didactic instruction in several disciplines, including training in clinical conditions and organizational behavior along with leadership development. She will also have ample opportunity for mentored, project-based learning, including developing advanced understanding of how to measure quality of care. The proposed research plan has three aims: Aim 1. To examine Medicare ACO coverage across patient race and socioeconomic status. Dr. Lewis will use Medicare claims data to examine whether disadvantaged patients are more or less likely than other patients to receive care from ACO providers compared to non-ACO providers and will examine the relative effects of (a) patterns of provider participation in ACOs and (b) patient selection. She will then use the National Survey of ACOs to determine if disadvantaged ACO patients are cared for at ACOs that are systematically different from other ACOs (e.g., types of ACO providers or services, ACO capabilities). Aim 2. To examine how Medicare ACO programs impact disparities in patient care outcomes. Dr. Lewis will use longitudinal Medicare claims data to examine how Medicare ACO programs affect disparities in quality outcomes over time. Analysis will focus on the extent to which changes in disparities are a result of differences withi providers (e.g., all ACO providers improve care for disadvantaged groups) or across providers (e.g., providers serving disadvantaged patients make rapid improvements under ACO programs). Aim 3. To understand how organizational characteristics, capabilities, and strategies influence changing disparities over time under Medicare ACO programs. Dr. Lewis will examine how and why organizational characteristics and capabilities influence changing disparities under ACO models. She will use data from the National Survey of ACOs to explore how ACOs' organizational characteristics (e.g., partnership structure, governance, capabilities) and implementation strategy (e.g., care management programs, physician feedback mechanisms) affect changes in disparities over time. Finally, she will follow up with in-depth interviews to understand how organizational characteristics may be detrimental or beneficial to changing disparities in care. Findings from this project will inform policymakers and implementers about how the ACO model can best facilitate improved health care equity alongside important goals of increased efficiency. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) hold the promise of reducing health care costs while improving quality, but little is known about how these initiatives may affect disparities in health care outcomes by race or socioeconomic status. The proposed project uses Medicare claims, the National Survey of ACOs, and qualitative interviews to examine (1) evenness of Medicare ACO coverage; (2) ACO effects on disparities in quality of care delivered; and (3) ACO characteristics, capabilities, and strategies associated with changing disparities in outcomes.",The Effects of Accountable Care Organizations on Health Care Disparities,9465404,K01AG049914,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Feedback ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Services ', ' Interview ', ' Mentors ', ' Patient Dumping ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' sociologist ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' Organizational Models ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Discipline ', ' Patient Selection ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' payment ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' beneficiary ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' public health relevance ', ' Medicare claim ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' project-based curriculum ', ' project-based learning ', ' leadership development ', ' racial minority ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NIA,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,K01,2018,130140,0.07926154632189455
"Integrating Social Determinants of Health Into Risk Adjustment Models:  An Opportunity to Improve Care Coordination Strategies For Medicaid Beneficiaries PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this project is to provide evidence of the value of measuring social determinants of health (SDH) in the Medicaid population. This project will demonstrate that risk stratification using traditional risk adjustment models (RAMs) can be improved significantly with the inclusion of SDH information in addition to the information these models typically rely on: age, gender, and medical diagnoses. In addition, this project will quantify incident and cumulative risk of various SDH factors on the onset of incident disease within a one year period, highlighting the need to address social and environmental disadvantages that drive health inequities so that Medicaid can achieve the triple aim: improved care and population health at lower cost. To accomplish our objectives, we will conduct a prospective cohort study that will enroll 9,600 adult Medicaid beneficiaries treated at two medical facilities located in Washington, DC. The study sample will be predominately black (i.e. 90%) with a slightly higher percentage of females (60%). Medicaid beneficiaries who participate will complete a comprehensive SDH assessment during their initial medical encounter that will include validated SDH questions that measure housing stability, food availability, financial strain, health behaviors, social support, etc. Six and 12 months after enrollment, we will conduct a telephone follow-up interview with subjects to determine if there have been any major changes to their social and environmental circumstances. We will merge the interview data with DC Medicaid claims data (two years pre and one year post enrollment date). We will use the prior claims data to characterize health care utilization and expenditures by: (1) different types of service (i.e., inpatient care, outpatient care, prescription drugs, etc); (2) acute versus chronic treatments; and (3) preventable versus non preventable. We will risk stratify the study sample using three RAMs (i.e., Chronic Disability and Payment System, The Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACG) System, and 3M Clinical Risk Groups (CRGs). We will compare predictions of next year's health care utilization and expenditures for each RAM using generalized linear models that include or exclude SDH variables. We will also quantify the incident and cumulative risk associated with different SDH factors on disease onset during a one year follow-up period using generalized estimating equation models. To reduce the large health inequities that exist in the Medicaid population, this project aims to demonstrate the critical need to measure and address SDH in our care delivery strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to demonstrate the utility of measuring social determinants of health (SDH) in the Medicaid population.

"The Impact of Medicaid Plans on Access to and Quality of SUD Treatment PROJECT SUMMARY  Medicaid, the largest health insurance sector in the U.S., with the most vulnerable individuals, is the least- well understood. There is little research on the effects of the structure of state Medicaid programs on access, patterns of care and outcomes of substance use disorder (SUD) care. States provide Medicaid benefits either through publicly managed Fee-for-Service (FFS) systems or by contracting with private Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) plans. Despite widespread adoption of MMC, its role is not well-understood, especially its effects on SUD treatment and service disparities. Little is known about any differences in SUD treatment between traditional FFS Medicaid and private MMC plans or differences across different types of managed care plans with different approaches to SUD treatment. The proposed study makes use of innovative random assignment methods to address this challenge in the Medicaid sector. In the proposed project, we apply a select group of metrics for assessing access, patterns of care and outcomes of SUD treatment, to describe the performance of systems, health plans, and provider groups in New York. We then conduct stratified analysis by race/ethnicity, gender, and rurality to identify which programs and plans have better outcomes and identify if there are service disparities. Our project uses qualitative methods to help interpret our results through in-depth interviews, and to provide insight on the interpretation of findings and suggest practice and policy changes.

"Medicaid Expansion in Oregon:  Access and Health Outcomes for Women and Infants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early intervention to identify and treat chronic disease and modify behavioral risk factors among women of reproductive age has the potential to significantly reduce their morbidity and mortality and improve their pregnancy outcomes. Lack of health insurance has been a major barrier to early intervention and preventive care among low-income women of reproductive age. However, the 2014 expansion of Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) will make millions of low-income women newly eligible for Medicaid and preventive health services. An integrated data system is essential to evaluate the impact of this expansion on the health of women of reproductive age and their infants. Research using this data system will inform future program planning and identify best practices and areas of greatest need. We propose to create an integrated data system that links Oregon Medicaid data with birth and death certificates and hospital discharge data. Further, we will include data on the quality of Medicaid services that are not available to other states. The proposed study is a collaborative effort between Oregon State University and the Oregon Health Authority. Oregon is an ideal state in which to conduct the proposed study because of its ongoing commitment to Medicaid health care delivery reform and the commitment of state leaders to collaborate across divisions and programs to ensure this project's success. The project also has the support of key state stakeholders in maternal and child health and women's health. The specific aims of the proposal are to1) develop a research agenda, in collaboration with key stakeholders, to evaluate the expansion of Medicaid on the health of Medicaid-eligible women of reproductive age, mothers, and infants in Oregon; 2) link Oregon Medicaid data for female enrollees ages 15-44 and their infants to statewide datasets, including (but not limited to) live birth, fetal death, infant death, and hospital discharge data, beginning with 2008 and continuing until 2016, as data become available; and 3) conduct planned analyses and disseminate findings. The research agenda will include key research questions that assess the effect of Medicaid expansion on Medicaid enrollment and access to care for low-income women; utilization of services by women and infants enrolled in Medicaid; general health behaviors, risks, and outcomes for these women; and pregnancy complications and poor birth outcomes. We will also measure disparities that remain after Medicaid expansion, to inform strategies to mitigate those disparities on an ongoing basis. We will use results of these analyses to construct simulations that extend this study's findings into implications and lessons for policy makers and stakeholders in other states that are expanding Medicaid. Results of these analyses and simulations will provide valuable information to support health reform efforts, both in Oregon and across the U.S, to reduce the public health burden and improve population health among women of reproductive age, including pregnancy and infant health outcomes. Project Narrative The collaborative research team will create an integrated, state-level data system that links Medicaid data with other existing data sets. Analyses will be conducted that will provide valuable evidence on the impact of Medicaid expansion in Oregon and across the US. Findings may be used to improve access to health care services and health outcomes among Medicaid-eligible women and their children.",Medicaid Expansion in Oregon:  Access and Health Outcomes for Women and Infants,9606142,U01DP004783,[''],NCCDPHP,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,62500,0.1412024080438288
"Effects of Expanded Coverage on Access, Health Care and Health in the South ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will provide timely and rigorous analysis of the effect of the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) insurance coverage expansions on health care use and outcomes among a large cohort of low-income adults in 12 southern states (VA, WV, KY, TN, NC, SC, FL ,GA, AL, MS, LA, AR). The ACA's coverage reforms encompass the largest insurance expansion since Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. Examining the effects of expansions on health care and outcomes for socio-demographic and clinical groups intended to benefit from expanded coverage will be critical to advancing scientific knowledge about the relationship between insurance coverage and health and to informing state decisions to expand Medicaid over the next several years. In no region of the country are rates of uninsurance higher, the prevalence of chronic conditions and cancer greater, and the implementation of the ACA's coverage expansions expected to be more varied, than in the South. The proposed 5-year research project will draw on these regional characteristics and the largest cohort of low- income, uninsured, and minority adults ever recruited in the US (nearly 85,000 in total), the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS). We will augment existing baseline and follow-up SCCS survey data from 2002-14 by fielding a timely additional survey starting in the second year of ACA reforms (2015-16) and by adding questions to a planned round of follow-up in 2016-17 to support consistent assessment of early and later effects of the reforms on health and to explore patient experiences obtaining coverage and accessing care in the post-expansions era. By combining these data with cancer registry and Medicare and Medicaid claims data through established data linkages, as well as establishing novel data linkages with state hospital discharge databases, we aim to quantify the effects of coverage expansion on: (Aim 1) access to care, cancer screening and use of preventive clinical services; (Aim 2) self-reported health outcomes, mortality, cancer care, and use of emergent and inpatient care; and (Aim 3) on access to care, utilization, and outcomes for adults with prior coverage whose access might be compromised by the expansions. To identify these effects, we will apply rigorous quasi-experimental difference-in-difference designs, leveraging both within- and between-state variation in coverage expansions. Our analytic approach will also incorporate regression and propensity score-based adjustment to balance observed characteristics between comparison groups. Finally, due to the longitudinal nature of our data and high observed mortality rates in the cohort, where appropriate we will use advanced methodological approaches to modeling death and health outcomes jointly. In short, our timely quasi-experimental analyses will help characterize the value of the ACA's coverage reforms, will inform policy debates over coverage expansions moving forward, and will advance understanding of the effects of insurance coverage on health care use and health outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will provide timely and rigorous analysis of the effect of health insurance coverage expansions on health care use and outcomes among a large cohort of low-income adults in 12 southeastern states. Using a quasi-experimental research design, we will quantify the effects of coverage expansion through Medicaid and private health insurance exchanges on (Aim 1) access to care, cancer screening and use of preventive clinical services; (Aim 2) self-reported health outcomes, mortality, cancer care, and use of emergent and inpatient care; and (Aim 3) on access to care, utilization, and outcomes for adults with prior coverage whose access might be compromised by the expansions.","Effects of Expanded Coverage on Access, Health Care and Health in the South",9538054,R01CA189152,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hospitals ', ' State Hospitals ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Oregon ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Privatization ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Uninsured ', ' Cover-up ', ' base ', ' court ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Data Linkages ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Country ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' cancer registry ', ' Modeling ', ' cancer care ', ' Vital Status ', ' Low income ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Improve Access ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Clinical Services ', ' comparison group ', ' inpatient care ', ' inpatient service ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' care preference ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' federal poverty level ', ' experimental analysis ', ' public health relevance ', ' data registry ', ' Emergent care ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative service ', ' Preventive service ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' recruit ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' ']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,415781,0.15499527262807963
"Community-based HIT Tools for Cancer Screening and Health Insurance Promotion DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer morbidity and mortality risks can be greatly reduced through screening and prevention. Patients without health insurance are much less likely to receive evidence-based cancer screenings and preventive care. Interventions that optimize and stabilize health insurance coverage could substantially increase rates of receipt of timely cancer preventive care. As many patients with unstable coverage receive care at Community Health Centers (CHCs), CHCs are well-positioned to provide such interventions. Recent advances in CHCs' health information technology (HIT) create new opportunities for using automated processes and data to support insurance outreach efforts. We propose to conduct a clinic-level cluster randomized trial in 12 CHCs (~47,000 patients aged 18-64) to test the effectiveness of Community-based HIT Tools for Cancer Screening and Health Insurance Promotion (""CATCH-UP"" tools) at improving rates of (1) cancer screening and prevention services, and (2) health insurance coverage. The CATCH-UP tools are designed to identify and reach uninsured CHC patients who are eligible for enrollment in public insurance coverage, and to encourage re-enrollment of publicly-insured patients before coverage gaps occur. Modeled after HIT tools proven effective for chronic disease management, the CATCH-UP tools include a panel management / data aggregator system coupled with automated patient outreach and communication. We will partner with OCHIN, a non-profit community HIT network that hosts one of the nation's largest CHC electronic health record platforms.  We hypothesize that patients of CHCs that have these tools will have higher rates of continuous insurance coverage, and as a result, higher rates of up-to-date age- and gender-appropriate cancer screening and prevention services, compared to patients of CHCs without such tools. Our aims are as follows. Aim 1: Evaluate the effect of the CATCH-UP intervention on up-to-date status of cancer screening and preventive care received by patients. We will assess gender- and age-appropriate rates of screening and assessment (colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, smoking, obesity); immunization (human papillomavirus vaccination); and counseling (smoking, weight). Aim 2: Evaluate the effect of the CATCH-UP intervention on patients' insurance coverage rates. To accomplish Aims 1 and 2, we will conduct clinic- and patient-level difference-in-differences quantitative analyses to compare pre- and post-intervention changes between control and intervention groups. Aim 3: Evaluate the intervention implementation process, patient and CHC staff acceptance and use of the CATCH-UP tools, and the patient-, provider-, and system-level factors associated with successful implementation and sustainability of the tools, using mixed methods. Understanding how HIT tools in CHCs and other community primary care settings can support insurance enrollment and retention efforts will be key to successfully expanding insurance coverage and reducing disparities in cancer screening and prevention services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Patients without health insurance are much less likely to receive recommended cancer screening and prevention services, and Community Health Centers (CHCs) provide a health care safety net for many of these uninsured patients. We will conduct a cluster-randomized trial in 12 CHCs to test the effectiveness of implementing Community-based HIT Tools for Cancer Screening and Health Insurance Promotion (""CATCH- UP"" tools) at improving rates of (1) cancer screening and prevention services; and (2) health insurance coverage.

"Using Satellite National Health Accounts to Understand Health and Cost Changes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Though health expenditures in the U.S. are carefully tracked by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the health outcomes associated with these expenditures are not. To address this need, our past research has developed detailed measures of population health and medical spending using existing national data, in order to systematically and jointly measure the benefits and the costs of medical care. These methods have been developed to serve as a Satellite National Health Account, enabling a better understanding of the health sector in the United States. We propose two new avenues of analysis using these tools that will greatly expand our understanding of health change in relation to costs across the U.S. population. The first is to examine health in conjunction with costs among all age groups- -including the elderly, middle-aged, young adults, and children-and among different socioeconomic groups. The second is to examine the health of those with different diseases, and understand specifically how it has changed over time in terms of the relationship of each disease to health and medical spending. A major output of the project is the production of a satellite National Health Account for the U.S. population as a whole, that gives critical information on health outcomes and medical expenditures for specific diseases over time, overall and among different sociodemographic groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will result in a National Health Account for the whole U.S. population, providing detailed information on health in conjunction with medical expenditures-overall, among those with different diseases, and in different socioeconomic groups.

"Impacts of the Affordable Care Act on Health Care Utilization Project Summary/Abstract The proposed research will use data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to investigate the impacts of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on the health care utilization of non-elderly adults. The research will utilize the identification strategy developed by the proposal's investigators in a previous study that estimated the causal effects of the ACA on health insurance coverage in both Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states (Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, forthcoming). This strategy features a difference-in-difference-in-differences model with the differences coming from time, state Medicaid expansion status, and local area pre-treatment uninsured rate. This last source of variation, which arises because universal coverage initiatives provide the most intense treatments in areas with high baseline uninsured rates, allows us to disentangle the causal effect of the ACA from the underlying time trend while also accounting for the possible endogeneity of state Medicaid expansion decisions. The proposed research will move past estimating impacts on health insurance outcomes to also examine numerous outcomes related to health care utilization. These outcomes will include frequency of and expenditures on: physician and non-physician office visits; inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room hospital visits; and prescription drugs. We will also examine total medical expenditures from all categories. For the expenditure outcomes, we will further subdivide by payer, including out-of-pocket, private insurance, and Medicaid. We will also conduct subsample analyses by age, race/ethnicity, education, income, gender, marital status, and presence of children in the home. Using these results, we will compute the extent to which the ACA reduced disparities on the bases of race/ethnicity and socio- economic status in both Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states. Finally, we will estimate instrumental variables models to determine the impacts of private coverage and Medicaid coverage on the various outcomes. Project Narrative/Relevance The Affordable Care Act (ACA) aimed to achieve nearly universal coverage in the United States through a combination of insurance market reforms, mandates, subsidies, and Medicaid expansions. This proposed research will investigate the impacts of the ACA on the health care utilization of non-elderly adults. This research is relevant to public health because it will provide important information about the impacts of the ACA that can inform future insurance-related public policies.",Impacts of the Affordable Care Act on Health Care Utilization,9535848,R03HS025514,[''],AHRQ,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,R03,2018,49867,0.19845598117114943
"Provider Networks and Quality of Physical Health Care for Adults with Serious Mental Illness ABSTRACT This exploratory/developmental study applies social network analysis methods to Medicaid claims data on patterns of multi-provider care received by adults with serious mental illness (SMI). The goal is to identify characteristics of provider networks that are associated with patterns of care for physical health conditions, including quality of care measures and utilization of emergency department and inpatient services. Multiple policy strategies, including health homes and behavioral health based primary care, are currently being pursued to improve the quality of physical health care received by adults with SMI. These strategies directly target networks of care, but studies tend to evaluate them by assessing provider or patient level outcomes. However, systemic improvement is unlikely to occur through replication of a single model across all states and regions. Rather, solutions are likely to depend on characteristics of local or regional provider networks. Despite recent advances in measurement of the quality of behavioral health care, methods for identifying, characterizing and analyzing networks of care for adults with SMI have yet to be developed. This exploratory/developmental project will address this gap by addressing two specific aims. First, we will identify and characterize networks of providers who treat adults with SMI in the Medicaid enrolled population in three states. This will be accomplished using social network analysis methods which infer relationships among providers based on their participation in the treatment of the same patients. Provider networks will then be characterized with respect to common network metrics such as their size (e.g. number of providers), geographic location (urban vs. rural), diversity (number of distinct provider types), density (proportion of patients that are shared), and composition (e.g. includes a hospital or hospital based clinic). This analysis, which will be the first to examine networks of care treating adults with SMI, will produce the basic descriptive foundation for the development of integrated care measures. Second, using the identified networks we will examine associations between network-level measures and the quality of care for physical health conditions and utilization of emergency department and inpatient services. The network-based measures developed in this project will advance research and provide policy-makers with new tools for promoting system integration. This project will thereby improve the effectiveness of efforts to reduce the 8-year disparity in life expectancy faced by adults with SMI. To maximize the impact of this work, detailed specifications of the final measures will be published for public use. Finally, results from this project will enable future research projects to investigate important aspects of health care delivery systems for adults with SMI that have not previously been studied. NARRATIVE This exploratory/developmental study applies social network analysis methods to Medicaid claims data to examine care for physical health conditions received by adults with serious mental illness (SMI). Provider networks will be characterized using standard network measures, such as network size and density, and used to develop new measures of the relationships between behavioral health and general medical care providers.

"Effect of School-Based Health Centers on Reducing Students Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in 5 persons in poverty is a child <18 years, and this number is growing, especially in the South. Further, 40% of African American and 34% of Hispanic children <18 years live in low-income households, and 55% of poor rural African-American children have less access to health services. Since a majority of public school students are from low-income families in both the South and West, public schools present an opportunity to reach underserved populations on-site with quality healthcare services. For > 2 decades model School-based Health Centers (SBHCs) have been tested to meet health needs of disparity population, but less than 1% of public elementary schools house SBHCs. Four issues must be addressed in taking SBHCs to scale: sustainability, evidence of community need and support, evidence of health and health cost impact, and fidelity to exemplar models. The ongoing Georgia SBHC Project provides operational solutions to the first two issues. The goal of the proposed study, EPOCH (Evaluating Processes and Outcomes for Children), will take advantage of an opportunity to conduct a ""natural experiment"" that will assess the ability of this approach to solve the other two issues. We will examine the effects of expanding SBHCs across three public elementary school sites in Georgia that differ by environment (rural, small city, and suburban) and race / ethnicity (one each being predominantly African American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white children). A specific focus will be the effects of SBHCs on improved access to primary care and, in turn, on the level of health outcomes including obesity, uncontrolled asthma, and Emergency Department and hospital utilization and costs to the Medicaid program. We will conduct a year-by-year comparison of health indicators and health care costs for children with and without access to SBHCs. In a novel approach to evaluating SBHCs, we will conduct a full-scale process and outcome evaluation, following the Implementation Fidelity model proposed by Carroll, et al., and modified by Hasson. This will include active monitoring to measure program adaptations, secondary analysis of SBHCs' benchmarking, schools' routine FitnessGrams and absenteeism statistics, and by linking children enrolled in an SBHC to their Medicaid claims records. This quasi-experimental, longitudinal study will include 7 years' data (3 pre-, 1 during, and 3 post-SBHC implementation) for the 3 SBHC schools and 3 similar, non-SBHC schools. Additionally, Medicaid data will be extracted for children living in the 6 schools' zip codes to conduct utilization and cost analyses on improving specific health outcomes (e.g., asthma and obesity) and reducing health disparities in rural and minority populations. The EPOCH study offers an opportunity to create a new evidence base for the role of SBHCs in states without the Medicaid expansion. Comprehensive SBHCs may have greater importance there because of the lack of alternatives for children to access free or subsidized health care. These findings will also inform the nation as it considers reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in 2015. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal for the proposed research is to evaluate the effectiveness of school-based health centers (SBHCs) in reducing disparities in obesity and asthma and improving school attendance in the low income child populations of the southeast. We can also measure health costs benefits to Medicaid during the first years of the Affordable Care Act. Taking advantage of a natural experiment in Georgia, this study addresses the critical need to test translation of an exemplar program across urban and rural schools for low income and minority students.",Effect of School-Based Health Centers on Reducing Students Health Disparities,9456532,R01MD008966,"['Absenteeism ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Medicaid ', ' Persons ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' base ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Rural ', ' satisfaction ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' programs ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Services ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' elementary school ', ' grade school ', ' hospital utilization ', ' success ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Modeling ', ' Sentinel ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Behavioral ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' obesity in children ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Natural experiment ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' minority student ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' secondary analysis ', ' lower income families ', ' rural African American ', ' Child Health ', ' ']",NIMHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,390000,0.01692274845356777
"Quality and Coordination of Care for Medicaid Managed Care Enrollees PROJECT SUMMARY The expansion of Medicaid coverage after the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has increased Medicaid coverage to 15% of the working-age adult population. Nationwide, 77% of Medicaid enrollees are in Medicaid Managed Care (“Medicaid MC”) plans. To constrain costs, Medicaid MC plans often contract with smaller sets of included physicians and hospitals (“networks”) than other insurance types. These smaller networks (“narrow networks”) have been quantified for ACA Marketplace plans and shown to be associated with reductions in patient access to care. A possible byproduct of smaller physician networks may be that physicians included in these narrow networks are more tightly connected, which could potentially result in more coordinated care for Medicaid MC enrollees. However, to our knowledge, no empirical research has examined the association between narrow networks and care coordination. Better understanding the association between narrow networks, quality, and coordination for Medicaid MC enrollees is critical to ensure continued access to high quality care for this vulnerable low-income population. Using state all payer claims databases (APCD) of commercial insurance and Medicaid claims from Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Colorado, Utah, and Oregon for 2014-2015, we will measure how narrow Medicaid MC physician and hospital networks are and examine their association with the quality and coordination of care received by Medicaid MC enrollees compared to Medicaid FFS and commercially insured enrollees. The goal of this research is to conduct a timely analysis of the current Medicaid MC market to provide information for future health insurance regulations regarding provider networks, particularly those used by low-income and vulnerable populations. Disparities in access for low-income and minority populations are well documented, with lower access to providers; we will measure whether this arises in part from differences in provider networks, which would suggest future policy clarifying and enforcing network adequacy standards may be an effective policy lever to improve access, quality, and coordination for Medicaid MC enrollees. This is a low cost, high impact secondary data analysis study by a well-qualified team of investigators. It will provide essential information on the relationship between narrow networks, quality, and coordination; the results will be used as a basis for future studies designed to examine the formation of these networks across insurance markets and to optimize the size and composition of these networks. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project uses health insurance claims data from Colorado, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Oregon, and Utah to evaluate the size and quality of provider networks for Medicaid Managed Care, as well as the association between network size and coordination of care for low-income Medicaid Managed Care enrollees. The results can inform the design of provider networks to maintain access to care and increase coordination of care for Medicaid populations. Quantifying provider networks available to Medicaid Managed Care enrollees will inform future regulations of network adequacy standards, which are critical to ensure access to high quality care for vulnerable populations.",Quality and Coordination of Care for Medicaid Managed Care Enrollees,9669534,R03HS025515,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R03,2018,53932,0.21934707724331237
"The Impact of the Recent Medicaid Expansions on Dental Services PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Low-income adults in the US have historically had worse dental health outcomes including untreated caries rates at ~40% and less access to dental care than higher income individuals. Lack of or limited dental coverage among poor adults is thought to be an important factor for oral health disparities by income. Recently, 31 states and Washington DC expanded their Medicaid eligibility to all nonelderly adults with income below 138% FPL, with 24 of these states expanding on January 1 2014. These expansions have substantially increased Medicaid coverage among low income nonelderly adults including by nearly 10 percentage points in 2015. Twelve states of these expanding states are offering extensive dental coverage for the newly eligible adults, and another 11 states and DC are offering limited dental coverage. The Medicaid expansions in these states suggest that newly eligible adults have increased access to dental coverage and services. However, the extent to which the increased dental coverage have resulted in changes in access and use of dental services is an empirical question that has not been adequately addressed. Our goal in this study is to provide causal evidence on the effects of the recent Medicaid expansions in states offering extensive or limited dental coverage for the newly eligible low-income adults on use of dental preventive services and treatments over multiple years post the expansion. In addition to examining differences in effect by state Medicaid generosity of dental coverage, we will also evaluate differences in expansion effects by availability of dental care providers, since areas with more constrained dentist supply may experience smaller effects. We will employ quasi-experimental designs and nationally representative data to estimate these effects. The study findings will be of direct relevance for informing policymakers and other stakeholders about the effectiveness of the recent Medicaid expansions in modifying access to dental care and oral health outcomes among poor nonelderly adults and can be useful for future policies. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will shed light on how recent increase in Medicaid coverage in certain states have affected access to and use of dental services among low income nonelderly adults. This can help in understanding the effectiveness of prior expansions in improving oral health outcomes and guiding future policies.",The Impact of the Recent Medicaid Expansions on Dental Services,9585294,R03DE028041,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Dental Association ', ' Crowding ', ' Dental Care ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental caries ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dentists ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Addressing Disparities in Bariatric Surgery outcomes for Medicaid Patients Project Abstract Severe obesity (body mass index [BMI]>35) affects nearly 20 million adults in the U.S. and is twice as common in adults from the lowest socioeconomic strata compared to the highest. Adults with severe obesity are much more likely to have obesity-related comorbidities, poorer quality of life, and shortened lifespans. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies have found that bariatric surgery provides greater weight loss and comorbidity resolution, better quality of life, and longer lifespans as compared with medical weight management strategies. Using Medicaid status as a way to identify lower socioeconomic status (SES), our preliminary data indicate that lower SES patients who undergo bariatric surgery have worse outcomes than higher SES patients. Among all adults who underwent bariatric surgery in Wisconsin from 2011-2014, Medicaid patients had higher rates of emergency department (ED) visits and readmissions within the first year following bariatric surgery. Similarly, our single institution reviews from two academic medical centers in different states found that Medicaid patients had higher rates of ED visits and readmissions within 90 days of surgery. Medicaid patients also lost significantly less weight than did non-Medicaid patients after bariatric surgery. Reasons for these disparities between Medicaid and non-Medicaid patients undergoing bariatric surgery are unknown. Our long-term goal is to develop and implement effective interventions that will improve the health of adults with severe obesity. Our objective in this application is to identify patient and community-level characteristics that are associated with suboptimal 90-day and 1-year outcomes for Medicaid patients who undergo bariatric surgery. To achieve this, we will use a sequential explanatory design, which includes collection and analysis of quantitative data, followed by collection and analysis of qualitative data. This mixed methods research design will allow us to explain and extend the quantitative findings through additional, qualitative studies. We propose the following two Specific Aims: 1) Identify patient characteristics and community-level determinants of health that are associated with suboptimal outcomes for Medicaid and non- Medicaid bariatric surgery patients; and 2) Understand patient and clinical care team perspectives on how patient, provider, and community-level determinants of health influence outcomes for Medicaid vs. non- Medicaid patients who undergo bariatric surgery. Public Health Relevance Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for severe obesity, but there are disparities in outcomes according to socioeconomic status (SES). Lower SES patients have higher rates of hospital utilization after bariatric surgery (emergency department visits and readmissions) and poorer outcomes, including less weight loss. Very little is known about why these disparities exist and what can be done to optimize outcomes for low SES patients.",Addressing Disparities in Bariatric Surgery outcomes for Medicaid Patients,9502652,R21MD012655,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Educational Status ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Medicaid ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Morbid Obesity ', ' extreme obesity ', ' Severe obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Policy Making ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' medical costs ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Employment Status ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Day Surgery ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Physical environment ', ' surgical service ', ' hospital utilization ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' readmission ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Bariatrics ', ' bariatric surgery ', ' weight loss surgery ', ' stomach stapling ', ' obesity surgery ', ' implantable gastric stimulation banding ', ' gastric bypass surgery ', ' gastric banding ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' operation ', ' food environment ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' improved outcome ', ' readmission rates ', ' surgical outcome ', ' surgery outcome ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2018,191250,0.13538437750645227
"Evaluating health disparities among likely transgender persons in Oregon PROJECT SUMMARY Beginning in 2012, the State of Oregon explicitly identified “Health Equity and Eliminating Health Disparities” as a key target of its Medicaid reform. Given the large share of transgender persons covered by the Medicaid program, changes in Medicaid policy provide a unique opportunity to address health and health disparities for this gender minority group. Recent cross-sectional studies suggest public insurance significantly improves access to transition-related care for transgender adults, while also increasing usage of preventive care and medically necessary services, resulting in better health outcomes for this population. In January 2015, Oregon extended its Medicaid benefits to provide coverage for transition-related care for transgender persons in order to address mental health disparities in this community. In doing so, Oregon became the second state whose Medicaid policy explicitly covered healthcare related to gender transition for transgender persons. As of March 2018, eighteen states and the District of Columbia now have similar Medicaid policies, but none have studied the impact of the new policy. Using extensive Oregon Medicaid claims data from 2010-2017, and applying a validated algorithm developed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for identifying transgender persons in administrative claims, this proposal aims undertake an analysis of longitudinal data to assess the ways in which health and health disparities in the transgender community can be improved by Medicaid reform, while also describing whether coverage for transition-related care meaningfully impacts use of these services by transgender beneficiaries. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study evaluates the role of Medicaid in improving health and reducing health disparities for transgender persons. By evaluating whether implementation of Oregon Medicaid coverage for transition-related care for transgender persons increased both usage of transition-related services and access to primary and preventive care, this study will provide critical information on the effectiveness of this reform, which was meant to address health disparities in the transgender community. Furthermore, this study will analyze extensive longitudinal data to enumerate how many transgender beneficiaries may potentially benefit from this reform.",Evaluating health disparities among likely transgender persons in Oregon,9694004,R01MD011212,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Integrating Social Determinants of Health Into Risk Adjustment Models:  An Opportunity to Improve Care Coordination Strategies For Medicaid Beneficiaries PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this project is to provide evidence of the value of measuring social determinants of health (SDH) in the Medicaid population. This project will demonstrate that risk stratification using traditional risk adjustment models (RAMs) can be improved significantly with the inclusion of SDH information in addition to the information these models typically rely on: age, gender, and medical diagnoses. In addition, this project will quantify incident and cumulative risk of various SDH factors on the onset of incident disease within a one year period, highlighting the need to address social and environmental disadvantages that drive health inequities so that Medicaid can achieve the triple aim: improved care and population health at lower cost. To accomplish our objectives, we will conduct a prospective cohort study that will enroll 9,600 adult Medicaid beneficiaries treated at two medical facilities located in Washington, DC. The study sample will be predominately black (i.e. 90%) with a slightly higher percentage of females (60%). Medicaid beneficiaries who participate will complete a comprehensive SDH assessment during their initial medical encounter that will include validated SDH questions that measure housing stability, food availability, financial strain, health behaviors, social support, etc. Six and 12 months after enrollment, we will conduct a telephone follow-up interview with subjects to determine if there have been any major changes to their social and environmental circumstances. We will merge the interview data with DC Medicaid claims data (two years pre and one year post enrollment date). We will use the prior claims data to characterize health care utilization and expenditures by: (1) different types of service (i.e., inpatient care, outpatient care, prescription drugs, etc); (2) acute versus chronic treatments; and (3) preventable versus non preventable. We will risk stratify the study sample using three RAMs (i.e., Chronic Disability and Payment System, The Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACG) System, and 3M Clinical Risk Groups (CRGs). We will compare predictions of next year's health care utilization and expenditures for each RAM using generalized linear models that include or exclude SDH variables. We will also quantify the incident and cumulative risk associated with different SDH factors on disease onset during a one year follow-up period using generalized estimating equation models.

"ACCESS: Assessing Community Cancer care after insurance ExpanSionS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer morbidity and mortality is greatly reduced through screening and prevention, but uninsured patients are much less likely than insured patients to receive these evidence-based services as recommended. Similarly, uninsured cancer survivors receive fewer primary and preventive care services than those with health insurance. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) called for every state to significantly expand Medicaid coverage by 2014; it is hypothesized that the ACA's Medicaid expansions could substantially (i) improve access to essential cancer preventive and screening services for previously uninsured patients, and (ii) facilitate better access to routine healthcare among cancer survivors who gain new health insurance. Little is yet known about how ACA Medicaid expansions are impacting the delivery of recommended cancer care. The 2012 United States (US) Supreme Court ruling that made ACA Medicaid expansions optional for states created a natural experiment to answer this important question. As of April 1, 2015, 30 states and the District of Columbia had expanded Medicaid, while 20 states had not. We will use this unprecedented natural experiment to study the effect of state-level Medicaid expansions on rates of cancer screening, cancer preventive services, and healthcare for cancer survivors. We will use electronic health record (EHR) data from the ADVANCE clinical data research network, which has data from 718 community health centers (CHCs), including 476 CHCs in 13 Medicaid expansion states and 242 CHCs in 8 non-expansion states. From this dataset, we will collect detailed information on changes in health insurance and healthcare service receipt, with data spanning 9 years (pre- and post-expansion), comparing states that expanded Medicaid, and those that did not. The specific aims are as follows: Aim 1. Compare pre-post receipt of cancer prevention and screening among CHC patients in Medicaid expansion versus non-expansion states. Aim 2. Compare pre-post insurance status, visits, and receipt of routine, recommended primary and preventive care among cancer survivors seen in CHCs in expansion versus non-expansion states. Aim 3. Compare pre-post cancer prevention, screening, and survivor care for newly insured (gained Medicaid in post-period), already insured (had Medicaid coverage in pre- and post-periods), and continuously uninsured (no coverage in pre- and post-periods) CHC patients in states that expanded Medicaid. This project builds on our team's experience studying health insurance, primary care, and receipt of preventive services. The ADVANCE dataset positions us uniquely to study national-level impacts of the ACA. Importantly, this project aligns with National Cancer Institute (NCI) goals to increase knowledge regarding cancer control and prevention. According to the NCI, ""prevention has the potential to save more lives from cancer than treatment...which underlines the importance of strongly supporting this research area."" Also, findings will be relevant to policy and practice, and will inform further improvements in the US healthcare system to mitigate disparities in cancer prevention and survivor care for vulnerable populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Some states implemented Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansions while other states did not, thus creating a natural experiment to study the impact of increased access to health insurance on cancer screening, cancer preventive services, and cancer survivor care. This innovative, timely study will use electronic health record (EHR) data from the ADVANCE clinical data research network (CDRN) of PCORnet, which has EHR data from 718 community health centers (CHCs), including 476 CHCs in 13 states that expanded Medicaid (n=576,711 patients), and 242 CHCs in 8 states that did not expand Medicaid (n=361,421 patients). The ADVANCE CDRN dataset uniquely positions us to assess cancer screening, prevention, and survivor care among vulnerable populations immediately after the ACA Medicaid expansions, and to follow these patients for several years after this landmark health policy natural experiment.",ACCESS: Assessing Community Cancer care after insurance ExpanSionS,9440398,R01CA204267,"['Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Identifying and Addressing Patient and System Factors Associated with Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Care of Adults with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Individuals with intellectual and developmental disorders (IDD) face complex health problems and experience substantially higher rates of chronic conditions and behavioral health (BH) problems. They also face unique barriers to high quality care such as inadequate knowledge among health professionals of the way biological, psychological, and social factors interact to determine overall health for people with IDD and communication challenges between patients and providers. There is evidence of significant unmet needs in physical and mental health care that disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minorities, including poorer health, as well as lower rates of recommended preventive screenings and vaccinations, dental services, and social services. Compounding these issues is the high reliance among the IDD population on insurance coverage through Medicaid, which provides much lower reimbursement than other payers. Although prior research provides some evidence of differences across racial and ethnic groups, it does not examine the impact and magnitude of specific system and environmental factors that may give rise to such disparities. Current evidence is of limited value for health policy formulation or system intervention design partly due to limitations in datasets and study designs that limit generalizability and do not allow comprehensive examination of care, utilization and outcomes. This project will identify patient, provider, and system-level factors that drive racial/ethnic disparities in adequacy of ambulatory medical and BH services among Medicaid-enrolled adults with intellectual and developmental disorders. It will specifically focus on IDD program services and their effect on patient overall health and wellbeing. We will use multi-year Medicaid claims data to analyze healthcare utilization and outcomes for individuals with IDD who reside in Intermediate Care Facilities, in the community with eligibility for Medicaid-funded IDD program services, and in the community but not eligible for such services. Understanding variations in system-level factors that contribute to gaps in care will help identify and address underlying racial and ethnic disparities in care among individuals with IDD. Analyses by the study team of service use and expenditures for New Jersey Medicaid beneficiaries show that patients with IDD are among the highest cost beneficiaries and make greater use of inpatient hospital and emergency department care. We will address this issue using a range of guideline-based quality metrics for IDD patients in Medicaid, including measures of preventive service use, inpatient and outpatient health outcomes that reflect coordination and continuity of care, follow up rates, and integration between physical and behavioral health care. Study results can provide important policy guidance relating to performance metrics or incentives within Medicaid managed care contracts; lead to guidelines for health professionals offering specific services; promote patient and family education among minority communities; and inform advocacy organizations about issues such as preventive care and recommended timelines for receiving procedures. Individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) face complex health problems and experience substantially higher rates of chronic conditions and behavioral health (BH) problems. This project will focus on patient and system-level factors that drive racial/ethnic disparities in adequacy of ambulatory medical and BH services among Medicaid-enrolled adults with IDD. We will in particular focus on the potential positive impact of non-medical community services in improving acute care outcomes.",Identifying and Addressing Patient and System Factors Associated with Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Care of Adults with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities,9529916,R03HS025519,[''],AHRQ,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R03,2018,50432,0.10532369057399862
"Assessing the Potential for a State Medicaid Reform Model to Reduce Disparities Project Summary: Provisions in the Affordable Care Act allow states substantial flexibility and opportunity to restructure their Medicaid programs. Given the disproportionate share of racial and ethnic minorities areas covered by the Medicaid program, changes in Medicaid policy provide a unique opportunity to address health disparities. However, Medicaid policies also face significant challenges, particularly in the ways in which this relatively low-reimbursing insurance program has left beneficiaries with problems of access and quality. One of the more ambitious Medicaid transformations has occurred in Oregon, which launched its system of “Coordinated Care Organizations,” or CCOs, in 2012. In legislation outlining the CCO model, the State of Oregon explicitly identified “Health Equity and Eliminating Health Disparities” as a fundamental target for delivery system changes. CCOs are required to: submit Community Health Improvement Plans, with goals for reducing disparities; provide services geographically located close to where members reside and offered in nontraditional settings that are accessible to diverse communities and underserved populations; provide incentives to attract underrepresented minority groups into the healthcare workforce; and broaden the use of community health workers. Using extensive claims and Electronic Health Record data and building on large policy experiment in Oregon, this proposal aims to assess the ways in which racial and ethnic disparities can be reduced through Medicaid reform, while also tracking the extent to which access and quality change for rural populations and the Medicaid program at large during these significant reform and expansion periods. Project Narrative/Relevance: This study evaluates the role of Medicaid in reducing disparities for racial and ethnic minorities. Using a policy experiment in Oregon, this study will provide critical information on the effectiveness of reforms that target the reduction of disparities, as well as measuring the effectiveness of community health workers and related approaches that can be adopted across Medicaid programs. We further assess the extent to which access and quality change for rural populations and the Medicaid program at large during these significant reform and expansion periods.",Assessing the Potential for a State Medicaid Reform Model to Reduce Disparities,9470813,R01MD011212,"['Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Elements ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incentives ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Medicaid ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Oregon ', ' Play ', ' Privatization ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rural Population ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Dimensions ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' trend ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' beneficiary ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' rural disparities ', ' site targeted delivery ', ' targeted delivery ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' effectiveness measure ', ' health equity ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' ']",NIMHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,648961,0.18646688632612887
"Impact of Medicaid Expansion on Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in ESRD Project Summary  The development of end stage renal disease (ESRD) carries devastating implications for patients, including increased morbidity and mortality, lost productivity, and impaired quality of life. The burden of this disease disproportionately falls on the country's most disadvantaged communities. In preliminary work for this grant, we found that 25% of patients aged 19-64 are uninsured at the time of initiating dialysis. This poses a barrier to receiving nephrology care prior to dialysis and initiating dialysis with an arteriovenous fistula rather than a high-risk temporary catheter. Failure to access these pre-dialysis services strongly predicts worse outcomes after dialysis including hospitalizations and death. Further, kidney failure due to diabetes and hypertension (the two most common causes of ESRD) can be prevented or delayed with appropriate blood pressure and glucose control. However, the uninsured have limited ability to finance health services and often forego effective preventive and chronic disease care. Taken together, these findings suggest that expanding health insurance coverage may be a powerful strategy to address disparities in the outcomes with and incidence of kidney failure. But there is limited research to confirm or refute this assertion. Filling this gap in knowledge is critical, since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides states with the option to expand Medicaid coverage to residents with income less than 138% of the Federal Poverty Level. Rigorous empirical evidence about the consequences of expansion, particularly for high-cost, high-need populations, may inform these decisions but are currently unavailable.  Using clinical data from all incident patients with ESRD in the United States from 2009-2018, our specific aims are: 1. Assess the effects of Medicaid expansion on pre-dialysis care for low-income incident populations; 2. Assess the impact of Medicaid expansion on post-dialysis outcomes; and 3. Evaluate early effects of Medicaid expansion on the incidence of ESRD. Our central hypotheses are that Medicaid expansion improved access to recommended pre-dialysis care; reduced hospitalizations and mortality following dialysis; and lowered the incidence of kidney failure, particularly among minority populations and those living in low- income neighborhoods. The proposal is innovative, as we leverage the variation in state Medicaid expansion decisions to test the causal effect of increased Medicaid coverage for a high-risk population. Further, by geocoding patient addresses we will track Census-Tract level outcomes, test alternative approaches for small area estimation, and assess geographic discontinuities across state borders. This project will provide rigorous evidence about the public health and health equity implications of a key feature of the ACA, perhaps the most consequential health care legislation since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. Project Narrative  This project will evaluate the impact of Medicaid expansion on access to effective pre-dialysis care, outcomes following the initiation of dialysis, and the incidence of end stage renal disease.

"Quality and Coordination of Care for Medicaid Managed Care Enrollees PROJECT SUMMARY The expansion of Medicaid coverage after the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has increased Medicaid coverage to 15% of the working-age adult population. Nationwide, 77% of Medicaid enrollees are in Medicaid Managed Care (“Medicaid MC”) plans. To constrain costs, Medicaid MC plans often contract with smaller sets of included physicians and hospitals (“networks”) than other insurance types. These smaller networks (“narrow networks”) have been quantified for ACA Marketplace plans and shown to be associated with reductions in patient access to care. A possible byproduct of smaller physician networks may be that physicians included in these narrow networks are more tightly connected, which could potentially result in more coordinated care for Medicaid MC enrollees. However, to our knowledge, no empirical research has examined the association between narrow networks and care coordination. Better understanding the association between narrow networks, quality, and coordination for Medicaid MC enrollees is critical to ensure continued access to high quality care for this vulnerable low-income population. Using state all payer claims databases (APCD) of commercial insurance and Medicaid claims from Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Colorado, Utah, and Oregon for 2014-2015, we will measure how narrow Medicaid MC physician and hospital networks are and examine their association with the quality and coordination of care received by Medicaid MC enrollees compared to Medicaid FFS and commercially insured enrollees. The goal of this research is to conduct a timely analysis of the current Medicaid MC market to provide information for future health insurance regulations regarding provider networks, particularly those used by low-income and vulnerable populations. Disparities in access for low-income and minority populations are well documented, with lower access to providers; we will measure whether this arises in part from differences in provider networks, which would suggest future policy clarifying and enforcing network adequacy standards may be an effective policy lever to improve access, quality, and coordination for Medicaid MC enrollees. This is a low cost, high impact secondary data analysis study by a well-qualified team of investigators. It will provide essential information on the relationship between narrow networks, quality, and coordination; the results will be used as a basis for future studies designed to examine the formation of these networks across insurance markets and to optimize the size and composition of these networks. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project uses health insurance claims data from Colorado, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Oregon, and Utah to evaluate the size and quality of provider networks for Medicaid Managed Care, as well as the association between network size and coordination of care for low-income Medicaid Managed Care enrollees. The results can inform the design of provider networks to maintain access to care and increase coordination of care for Medicaid populations. Quantifying provider networks available to Medicaid Managed Care enrollees will inform future regulations of network adequacy standards, which are critical to ensure access to high quality care for vulnerable populations.",Quality and Coordination of Care for Medicaid Managed Care Enrollees,9773054,R03HS025515,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R03,2019,45215,0.21934707724331237

"Using Satellite National Health Accounts to Understand Health and Cost Changes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Though health expenditures in the U.S. are carefully tracked by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the health outcomes associated with these expenditures are not. To address this need, our past research has developed detailed measures of population health and medical spending using existing national data, in order to systematically and jointly measure the benefits and the costs of medical care. These methods have been developed to serve as a Satellite National Health Account, enabling a better understanding of the health sector in the United States. We propose two new avenues of analysis using these tools that will greatly expand our understanding of health change in relation to costs across the U.S. population. The first is to examine health in conjunction with costs among all age groups- -including the elderly, middle-aged, young adults, and children-and among different socioeconomic groups. The second is to examine the health of those with different diseases, and understand specifically how it has changed over time in terms of the relationship of each disease to health and medical spending. A major output of the project is the production of a satellite National Health Account for the U.S. population as a whole, that gives critical information on health outcomes and medical expenditures for specific diseases over time, overall and among different sociodemographic groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will result in a National Health Account for the whole U.S. population, providing detailed information on health in conjunction with medical expenditures-overall, among those with different diseases, and in different socioeconomic groups.

"Provider Networks and Quality of Physical Health Care for Adults with Serious Mental Illness ABSTRACT This exploratory/developmental study applies social network analysis methods to Medicaid claims data on patterns of multi-provider care received by adults with serious mental illness (SMI). The goal is to identify characteristics of provider networks that are associated with patterns of care for physical health conditions, including quality of care measures and utilization of emergency department and inpatient services. Multiple policy strategies, including health homes and behavioral health based primary care, are currently being pursued to improve the quality of physical health care received by adults with SMI. These strategies directly target networks of care, but studies tend to evaluate them by assessing provider or patient level outcomes. However, systemic improvement is unlikely to occur through replication of a single model across all states and regions. Rather, solutions are likely to depend on characteristics of local or regional provider networks. Despite recent advances in measurement of the quality of behavioral health care, methods for identifying, characterizing and analyzing networks of care for adults with SMI have yet to be developed. This exploratory/developmental project will address this gap by addressing two specific aims. First, we will identify and characterize networks of providers who treat adults with SMI in the Medicaid enrolled population in three states. This will be accomplished using social network analysis methods which infer relationships among providers based on their participation in the treatment of the same patients. Provider networks will then be characterized with respect to common network metrics such as their size (e.g. number of providers), geographic location (urban vs. rural), diversity (number of distinct provider types), density (proportion of patients that are shared), and composition (e.g. includes a hospital or hospital based clinic). This analysis, which will be the first to examine networks of care treating adults with SMI, will produce the basic descriptive foundation for the development of integrated care measures. Second, using the identified networks we will examine associations between network-level measures and the quality of care for physical health conditions and utilization of emergency department and inpatient services. The network-based measures developed in this project will advance research and provide policy-makers with new tools for promoting system integration. This project will thereby improve the effectiveness of efforts to reduce the 8-year disparity in life expectancy faced by adults with SMI. To maximize the impact of this work, detailed specifications of the final measures will be published for public use. Finally, results from this project will enable future research projects to investigate important aspects of health care delivery systems for adults with SMI that have not previously been studied. NARRATIVE This exploratory/developmental study applies social network analysis methods to Medicaid claims data to examine care for physical health conditions received by adults with serious mental illness (SMI). Provider networks will be characterized using standard network measures, such as network size and density, and used to develop new measures of the relationships between behavioral health and general medical care providers. These measures will provide researchers and policy makers with new tools for improving the care for adults with SMI.",Provider Networks and Quality of Physical Health Care for Adults with Serious Mental Illness,9697433,R21MH113882,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Services ', ' Hospitals ', ' Claims Review ', ' Claims Analysis ', ' Claims Analyses ', ' Insurance Claim Review ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Maps ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mentally Ill ', ' Mental Patients ', ' Mentally Ill Persons ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Request for Proposals ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Health Benefit ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Systems Integration ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Investigation ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Health Care Sector ', ' Healthcare Sector ', ' interest ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Performance ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' beneficiary ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' inpatient service ', ' inpatient care ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' severe mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Network-based ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' primary care services ', ' provider networks ', ' ']",NIMH,RAND CORPORATION,R21,2019,242360,0.05565308485083181
"The Impact of Medicaid Plans on Access to and Quality of SUD Treatment PROJECT SUMMARY  Medicaid, the largest health insurance sector in the U.S., with the most vulnerable individuals, is the least- well understood. There is little research on the effects of the structure of state Medicaid programs on access, patterns of care and outcomes of substance use disorder (SUD) care. States provide Medicaid benefits either through publicly managed Fee-for-Service (FFS) systems or by contracting with private Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) plans. Despite widespread adoption of MMC, its role is not well-understood, especially its effects on SUD treatment and service disparities. Little is known about any differences in SUD treatment between traditional FFS Medicaid and private MMC plans or differences across different types of managed care plans with different approaches to SUD treatment.

"Improving Minority Health by Monitoring Medicaid Quality, Disparities and Value PROJECT SUMMARY Treating individuals with schizophrenia requires a broad array of services, including physical health care services, which are primarily financed by Medicaid. Despite high health care costs, most patients do not receive recommended care, and minorities are less likely to do so than whites. Moreover, where patients live matters, with quality and quality disparities varying not just among states but also among counties within states. At a time of reform and fiscal constraint, Medicaid programs are challenged with improving quality and reducing quality disparities among high-needs beneficiaries, including those with schizophrenia, at no extra costs. Factors likely to impact a program’s success include its ability to 1) comprehensively measure quality of care, capturing key domains of both mental health and physical health care, 2) validly and feasibly measure the value of care routinely delivered to their beneficiaries, and importantly, 3) incorporate racial/ethnic disparities in the assessment of value. Such measurement efforts should be undertaken at the level of meaningful geographic units such as counties, where patterns of health care are influenced by policies reflecting both state and local priorities. In response to FOA 16-221, we propose a program of research that seeks to reduce health disparities and improve the health of minority populations served in publicly funded settings through measurement of quality disparities and other critical domains of Medicaid-financed care delivered to adults with schizophrenia living in five diverse states. We will measure quality using evidence- based indicators, and exploiting psychometric principles, we will create an overall composite score as well as key sub-scores. Using the composite measure, we will assess racial/ethnic and geographic disparities in overall quality of care; value, defined as the cost to the Medicaid state program of producing high-quality care; and the cost to the program of eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in quality. We will integrate quality and costs through a unique cost-effectiveness methodology, and to our knowledge, our work will be the first to quantitatively link disparities and costs of serious mental illness care. Our ultimate goal is to provide policymakers with a user-friendly interactive tool to monitor quality, quality disparities, costs, and value, thus enabling evidence-based policymaking. Aim 1 will assess racial/ethnic and geographic disparities in quality of mental health, physical health, and overall health care routinely delivered to beneficiaries with schizophrenia. Aim 2 will develop and implement a cost-effectiveness framework to assess value, operationalized as the incremental net monetary benefit of care. Aim 3 will use the statewide white population as a reference standard to determine the cost of eliminating racial/ethnic quality disparities in each county. Aim 4 will develop and pilot a user-friendly interactive tool to enable state Medicaid programs to monitor quality, disparities, costs, and value of care. We expect that the proposed research will contribute to the eradication of disparities through advanced performance measurement techniques that will enable routine monitoring of Medicaid care. Project Narrative The proposed research has high public health relevance because (1) we focus on Medicaid beneficiaries with schizophrenia, a seriously ill population for whom access to high-quality care may be transformative, yet poor quality as well as quality disparities can lead to personal and societal suffering, premature mortality, and high costs, and (2) we seek to substantially expand and develop first evidence on overall quality of care, including physical health care; disparities in quality of care, both racial/ethnic and geographic; value of care, or the cost to the Medicaid state program of producing high-quality care; and the costs of eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in quality. Moreover, through the development of a monitoring tool that will be made available to state Medicaid programs, we will enable evidence-based policy-making aimed at improving care for this vulnerable population.","Improving Minority Health by Monitoring Medicaid Quality, Disparities and Value",9689261,R01MD012428,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Budgets ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Sources ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Foundations ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Locales ', ' Medicaid ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Policy Making ', ' Psychometrics ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Provincial Government ', ' State Government ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Managed Care ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' beneficiary ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' severe mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' Healthcare Fees ', ' charges for healthcare ', ' charges for health care ', ' Health Care Fees ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' user-friendly ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' routine care ', ' interactive tool ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' care costs ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2019,765114,0.1063541441998683
"Integrating Social Determinants of Health Into Risk Adjustment Models:  An Opportunity to Improve Care Coordination Strategies For Medicaid Beneficiaries PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this project is to provide evidence of the value of measuring social determinants of health (SDH) in the Medicaid population. This project will demonstrate that risk stratification using traditional risk adjustment models (RAMs) can be improved significantly with the inclusion of SDH information in addition to the information these models typically rely on: age, gender, and medical diagnoses. In addition, this project will quantify incident and cumulative risk of various SDH factors on the onset of incident disease within a one year period, highlighting the need to address social and environmental disadvantages that drive health inequities so that Medicaid can achieve the triple aim: improved care and population health at lower cost. To accomplish our objectives, we will conduct a prospective cohort study that will enroll 9,600 adult Medicaid beneficiaries treated at two medical facilities located in Washington, DC. The study sample will be predominately black (i.e. 90%) with a slightly higher percentage of females (60%). Medicaid beneficiaries who participate will complete a comprehensive SDH assessment during their initial medical encounter that will include validated SDH questions that measure housing stability, food availability, financial strain, health behaviors, social support, etc. Six and 12 months after enrollment, we will conduct a telephone follow-up interview with subjects to determine if there have been any major changes to their social and environmental circumstances. We will merge the interview data with DC Medicaid claims data (two years pre and one year post enrollment date). We will use the prior claims data to characterize health care utilization and expenditures by: (1) different types of service (i.e., inpatient care, outpatient care, prescription drugs, etc); (2) acute versus chronic treatments; and (3) preventable versus non preventable. We will risk stratify the study sample using three RAMs (i.e., Chronic Disability and Payment System, The Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACG) System, and 3M Clinical Risk Groups (CRGs). We will compare predictions of next year's health care utilization and expenditures for each RAM using generalized linear models that include or exclude SDH variables. We will also quantify the incident and cumulative risk associated with different SDH factors on disease onset during a one year follow-up period using generalized estimating equation models. To reduce the large health inequities that exist in the Medicaid population, this project aims to demonstrate the critical need to measure and address SDH in our care delivery strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to demonstrate the utility of measuring social determinants of health (SDH) in the Medicaid population.

"Addressing Disparities in Bariatric Surgery outcomes for Medicaid Patients Project Abstract Severe obesity (body mass index [BMI]>35) affects nearly 20 million adults in the U.S. and is twice as common in adults from the lowest socioeconomic strata compared to the highest. Adults with severe obesity are much more likely to have obesity-related comorbidities, poorer quality of life, and shortened lifespans. Randomized controlled trials and observational studies have found that bariatric surgery provides greater weight loss and comorbidity resolution, better quality of life, and longer lifespans as compared with medical weight management strategies. Using Medicaid status as a way to identify lower socioeconomic status (SES), our preliminary data indicate that lower SES patients who undergo bariatric surgery have worse outcomes than higher SES patients. Among all adults who underwent bariatric surgery in Wisconsin from 2011-2014, Medicaid patients had higher rates of emergency department (ED) visits and readmissions within the first year following bariatric surgery. Similarly, our single institution reviews from two academic medical centers in different states found that Medicaid patients had higher rates of ED visits and readmissions within 90 days of surgery. Medicaid patients also lost significantly less weight than did non-Medicaid patients after bariatric surgery. Reasons for these disparities between Medicaid and non-Medicaid patients undergoing bariatric surgery are unknown. Our long-term goal is to develop and implement effective interventions that will improve the health of adults with severe obesity. Our objective in this application is to identify patient and community-level characteristics that are associated with suboptimal 90-day and 1-year outcomes for Medicaid patients who undergo bariatric surgery. To achieve this, we will use a sequential explanatory design, which includes collection and analysis of quantitative data, followed by collection and analysis of qualitative data. This mixed methods research design will allow us to explain and extend the quantitative findings through additional, qualitative studies. We propose the following two Specific Aims: 1) Identify patient characteristics and community-level determinants of health that are associated with suboptimal outcomes for Medicaid and non- Medicaid bariatric surgery patients; and 2) Understand patient and clinical care team perspectives on how patient, provider, and community-level determinants of health influence outcomes for Medicaid vs. non- Medicaid patients who undergo bariatric surgery. Public Health Relevance Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for severe obesity, but there are disparities in outcomes according to socioeconomic status (SES). Lower SES patients have higher rates of hospital utilization after bariatric surgery (emergency department visits and readmissions) and poorer outcomes, including less weight loss. Very little is known about why these disparities exist and what can be done to optimize outcomes for low SES patients.",Addressing Disparities in Bariatric Surgery outcomes for Medicaid Patients,9788526,R21MD012655,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Medicaid ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' extreme obesity ', ' Severe obesity ', ' Morbid Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Policy Making ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Employment Status ', ' Day Surgery ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Physical environment ', ' surgical service ', ' hospital utilization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' re-admission ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Bariatrics ', ' bariatric surgery ', ' weight loss surgery ', ' stomach stapling ', ' obesity surgery ', ' implantable gastric stimulation banding ', ' gastric bypass surgery ', ' gastric banding ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Resolution ', ' Collection ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' operation ', ' food environment ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' improved outcome ', ' readmission rates ', ' rehospitalization rate ', ' re-hospitalization rate ', ' re-admission rates ', ' hospital readmission rate ', ' hospital re-admission rates ', ' surgery outcome ', ' surgical outcome ', ' clinical database ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2019,229500,0.13538437750645227

"Impact of Medicare Part D Gap Closure on Health Outcomes The Affordable Care Act (ACA) included provisions to gradually close the Medicare Part D coverage gap (or “doughnut hole”) for prescription drugs. Starting in 2011, drug manufacturers began offering a 50% discount on all brand name drugs for individuals in the coverage gap. Between 2011 and 2020, government subsidies for both brand name and generic drugs will slowly fill in remaining parts of the gap. The coverage gap has led to significant decreases in medication adherence for patients with chronic illness, which has, in turn, resulted in uncontrolled symptoms and adverse health outcomes. As the policy goes into effect, the total annual cost of purchasing medications will decrease for individuals that would have reached the gap under the old policy, which could lead to significant improvements in adherence and health outcomes. Two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries have multiple chronic conditions, and often require treatment with many costly medications. Treatment presents unique challenges in minority patients, who have a higher prevalence of chronic illness, and often require more medications and costlier medications in order to manage their conditions. In this study, we plan to examine whether the closure of the coverage gap leads to real-world improved adherence and health outcomes. Using a 5% national sample of Medicare Claims data from 2006-2017, we will examine the impact of the coverage gap closure on: 1) anticipatory behavior measured by medication adherence across benefit phases and drug types, 2) non-pharmacy healthcare utilization and outcomes and 3) whether the policy led to differential outcomes for racial and ethnic minorities. Our study will use a difference-in-differences approach with nonparametric matching, comparing the impact of the policy between those who previously had coverage in the gap, and those who faced standard benefits. Beneficiaries who received low-income subsidies did not face a coverage gap, and thus will not have any change in benefits as a result of the policy. We will compare these patients to a similar group of near-poor individuals based on a validated census-based SES measure who did not receive subsidies, and thus faced the coverage gap prior to 2010. This study will be the first to examine the impact of the initial coverage gap closure under the ACA, and will provide timely and critical information on the impact how benefit designs with high patient cost sharing influence patient behavior. In addition, we will determine whether the design of the coverage gap resulted in decreases in drug utilization throughout the entire year or only during the coverage gap period, indicating the degree to which individuals are able anticipate future health care spending. This has important implications for understanding behavior under other insurance benefit designs that have different coverage phases (e.g., deductibles, coverage limits). This study will provide important information about how prescription cost-sharing affects healthcare utilization and health outcomes, as well as disparities in these important endpoints, and will provide important information to policy makers about how to design insurance benefits and to lessen the consequences of poor adherence. The closure of the Medicare Part D coverage gap that began in 2011 was intended to provide more comprehensive benefits to Medicare enrollees and to lessen financial strain on those who need to take costly medications. This study will provide important evidence about how much of an impact this policy and similar polices have on medication utilization and health outcomes, as well as disparities in these important endpoints.",Impact of Medicare Part D Gap Closure on Health Outcomes,9918088,R01AG054424,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Censuses ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Deductibles ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Drug Utilization ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' National Government ', ' Federal Government ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Insurance Benefits ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Health Insurance ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Morals ', ' Names ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Privatization ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Government Subsidy ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Police ', ' Drug Costs ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Non-proprietary Drugs ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Services ', ' hazard ', ' Sampling ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Provider ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' treatment compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient cooperation ', ' patient adherence ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Calendar ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' beneficiary ', ' discount ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Medicare claim ', ' non-drug ', ' nondrug ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' racial minority ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' health difference ', ' differences in health ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial stress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial distress ', ' financial burden ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,75059,0.067084503019252
"ACCESS: Assessing Community Cancer care after insurance ExpanSionS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer morbidity and mortality is greatly reduced through screening and prevention, but uninsured patients are much less likely than insured patients to receive these evidence-based services as recommended. Similarly, uninsured cancer survivors receive fewer primary and preventive care services than those with health insurance. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) called for every state to significantly expand Medicaid coverage by 2014; it is hypothesized that the ACA's Medicaid expansions could substantially (i) improve access to essential cancer preventive and screening services for previously uninsured patients, and (ii) facilitate better access to routine healthcare among cancer survivors who gain new health insurance. Little is yet known about how ACA Medicaid expansions are impacting the delivery of recommended cancer care. The 2012 United States (US) Supreme Court ruling that made ACA Medicaid expansions optional for states created a natural experiment to answer this important question. As of April 1, 2015, 30 states and the District of Columbia had expanded Medicaid, while 20 states had not. We will use this unprecedented natural experiment to study the effect of state-level Medicaid expansions on rates of cancer screening, cancer preventive services, and healthcare for cancer survivors. We will use electronic health record (EHR) data from the ADVANCE clinical data research network, which has data from 718 community health centers (CHCs), including 476 CHCs in 13 Medicaid expansion states and 242 CHCs in 8 non-expansion states. From this dataset, we will collect detailed information on changes in health insurance and healthcare service receipt, with data spanning 9 years (pre- and post-expansion), comparing states that expanded Medicaid, and those that did not. The specific aims are as follows: Aim 1. Compare pre-post receipt of cancer prevention and screening among CHC patients in Medicaid expansion versus non-expansion states. Aim 2. Compare pre-post insurance status, visits, and receipt of routine, recommended primary and preventive care among cancer survivors seen in CHCs in expansion versus non-expansion states. Aim 3. Compare pre-post cancer prevention, screening, and survivor care for newly insured (gained Medicaid in post-period), already insured (had Medicaid coverage in pre- and post-periods), and continuously uninsured (no coverage in pre- and post-periods) CHC patients in states that expanded Medicaid. This project builds on our team's experience studying health insurance, primary care, and receipt of preventive services. The ADVANCE dataset positions us uniquely to study national-level impacts of the ACA. Importantly, this project aligns with National Cancer Institute (NCI) goals to increase knowledge regarding cancer control and prevention. According to the NCI, ""prevention has the potential to save more lives from cancer than treatment...which underlines the importance of strongly supporting this research area."" Also, findings will be relevant to policy and practice, and will inform further improvements in the US healthcare system to mitigate disparities in cancer prevention and survivor care for vulnerable populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Some states implemented Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansions while other states did not, thus creating a natural experiment to study the impact of increased access to health insurance on cancer screening, cancer preventive services, and cancer survivor care. This innovative, timely study will use electronic health record (EHR) data from the ADVANCE clinical data research network (CDRN) of PCORnet, which has EHR data from 718 community health centers (CHCs), including 476 CHCs in 13 states that expanded Medicaid (n=576,711 patients), and 242 CHCs in 8 states that did not expand Medicaid (n=361,421 patients).

"The Effects of Accountable Care Organizations on Health Care Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) are being pursued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as a means to rein in health care cost growth while improving quality of care, but little is known about how ACO efforts to improve health care efficiency might affect health care equity. In this context, the candidate (Dr. Valerie A. Lewis) seeks to understand how ACOs affect racial and socioeconomic disparities in health care outcomes. The candidate, a sociologist and health services researcher at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, will leverage this application to develop her research agenda and develop into an independent investigator. During the period of support, she will pursue didactic instruction in several disciplines, including training in clinical conditions and organizational behavior along with leadership development. She will also have ample opportunity for mentored, project-based learning, including developing advanced understanding of how to measure quality of care. The proposed research plan has three aims: Aim 1. To examine Medicare ACO coverage across patient race and socioeconomic status. Dr. Lewis will use Medicare claims data to examine whether disadvantaged patients are more or less likely than other patients to receive care from ACO providers compared to non-ACO providers and will examine the relative effects of (a) patterns of provider participation in ACOs and (b) patient selection. She will then use the National Survey of ACOs to determine if disadvantaged ACO patients are cared for at ACOs that are systematically different from other ACOs (e.g., types of ACO providers or services, ACO capabilities). Aim 2. To examine how Medicare ACO programs impact disparities in patient care outcomes. Dr. Lewis will use longitudinal Medicare claims data to examine how Medicare ACO programs affect disparities in quality outcomes over time. Analysis will focus on the extent to which changes in disparities are a result of differences withi providers (e.g., all ACO providers improve care for disadvantaged groups) or across providers (e.g., providers serving disadvantaged patients make rapid improvements under ACO programs). Aim 3. To understand how organizational characteristics, capabilities, and strategies influence changing disparities over time under Medicare ACO programs. Dr. Lewis will examine how and why organizational characteristics and capabilities influence changing disparities under ACO models. She will use data from the National Survey of ACOs to explore how ACOs' organizational characteristics (e.g., partnership structure, governance, capabilities) and implementation strategy (e.g., care management programs, physician feedback mechanisms) affect changes in disparities over time. Finally, she will follow up with in-depth interviews to understand how organizational characteristics may be detrimental or beneficial to changing disparities in care. Findings from this project will inform policymakers and implementers about how the ACO model can best facilitate improved health care equity alongside important goals of increased efficiency. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) hold the promise of reducing health care costs while improving quality, but little is known about how these initiatives may affect disparities in health care outcomes by race or socioeconomic status.

"Identifying and Addressing Patient and System Factors Associated with Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Care of Adults with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Individuals with intellectual and developmental disorders (IDD) face complex health problems and experience substantially higher rates of chronic conditions and behavioral health (BH) problems. They also face unique barriers to high quality care such as inadequate knowledge among health professionals of the way biological, psychological, and social factors interact to determine overall health for people with IDD and communication challenges between patients and providers. There is evidence of significant unmet needs in physical and mental health care that disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minorities, including poorer health, as well as lower rates of recommended preventive screenings and vaccinations, dental services, and social services. Compounding these issues is the high reliance among the IDD population on insurance coverage through Medicaid, which provides much lower reimbursement than other payers. Although prior research provides some evidence of differences across racial and ethnic groups, it does not examine the impact and magnitude of specific system and environmental factors that may give rise to such disparities. Current evidence is of limited value for health policy formulation or system intervention design partly due to limitations in datasets and study designs that limit generalizability and do not allow comprehensive examination of care, utilization and outcomes. This project will identify patient, provider, and system-level factors that drive racial/ethnic disparities in adequacy of ambulatory medical and BH services among Medicaid-enrolled adults with intellectual and developmental disorders. It will specifically focus on IDD program services and their effect on patient overall health and wellbeing. We will use multi-year Medicaid claims data to analyze healthcare utilization and outcomes for individuals with IDD who reside in Intermediate Care Facilities, in the community with eligibility for Medicaid-funded IDD program services, and in the community but not eligible for such services. Understanding variations in system-level factors that contribute to gaps in care will help identify and address underlying racial and ethnic disparities in care among individuals with IDD. Analyses by the study team of service use and expenditures for New Jersey Medicaid beneficiaries show that patients with IDD are among the highest cost beneficiaries and make greater use of inpatient hospital and emergency department care. We will address this issue using a range of guideline-based quality metrics for IDD patients in Medicaid, including measures of preventive service use, inpatient and outpatient health outcomes that reflect coordination and continuity of care, follow up rates, and integration between physical and behavioral health care. Study results can provide important policy guidance relating to performance metrics or incentives within Medicaid managed care contracts; lead to guidelines for health professionals offering specific services; promote patient and family education among minority communities; and inform advocacy organizations about issues such as preventive care and recommended timelines for receiving procedures. Individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) face complex health problems and experience substantially higher rates of chronic conditions and behavioral health (BH) problems. This project will focus on patient and system-level factors that drive racial/ethnic disparities in adequacy of ambulatory medical and BH services among Medicaid-enrolled adults with IDD. We will in particular focus on the potential positive impact of non-medical community services in improving acute care outcomes.",Identifying and Addressing Patient and System Factors Associated with Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Care of Adults with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities,9691366,R03HS025519,[''],AHRQ,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R03,2019,47137,0.10532369057399862
"Evaluating Control of Hypertension - Effect of Social Determinants (ECHOES) Project Summary Hypertension (HTN) is the most common chronic condition among adults in the United States (US). Uninsured adults are more likely to have undiagnosed HTN, less likely to receive regular screening, and less likely to have their HTN under control than insured adults. Prior studies of individual states' Medicaid expansion showed that gaining insurance increased healthcare service utilization, receipt of recommended preventive care, and improved health outcomes; but these studies were limited by having no comparison group. More recently, multiple states were impacted by federal policy changes (e.g., Affordable Care Act [ACA]), creating `natural experiments' to assess whether and how gaining (or losing) health insurance improves HTN prevention and care. Further, there is variability in how states choose to expand or contract coverage, which creates opportunities to identify `intervention' and `control' states (e.g., some states expanded Medicaid eligibility, while others did not). We are well-poised to study the ACA Medicaid expansion natural policy experiment and other policy changes that may unfold in the next few years. In addition, access to care through health insurance may be insufficient to reduce barriers to HTN care. Thus, other social determinants of health ([SDOH]; e.g., individual- and community-level factors) may differentially affect the relationship between gaining insurance and receiving HTN care. We will use electronic health record (EHR) data from the ADVANCE clinical data research network, linked to community-level SDOH, which has data from 599 community health centers (CHCs), including 376 CHCs in 14 Medicaid expansion states (n=1,139,779 patients) and 224 CHCs in 8 non- expansion states (n=658,306 patients). From this dataset, we will collect detailed information on changes in HTN incidence, screening, treatment, and management comparing states that expanded Medicaid, and those that did not. The specific aims are as follows: Aim 1. Compare HTN incidence, prevalence of undiagnosed HTN, and rates of HTN screening, in Medicaid expansion versus non-expansion states before and after the ACA. Aim 2. Compare HTN treatment and management in Medicaid expansion versus non-expansion states, before and after the ACA. Aim 3. Assess the extent to which rates of HTN incidence, screening, and treatment effectiveness among patients who gained insurance versus those continuously insured or uninsured, pre-post ACA, are moderated by individual-level SDOH (e.g., race, ethnicity). Aim 4. Explore the interaction between community-level SDOH (e.g., neighborhood racial segregation and deprivation) and HTN screening, treatment, and management among patients who gained insurance relative to those who were already insured or uninsured, in expansion states. We will build directly on our preliminary work and take advantage of the diverse strengths of our multidisciplinary team. The ADVANCE dataset uniquely positions us to assess current and future natural experiments. Findings will be relevant to policy and practice changes aimed at mitigating disparities in HTN care for vulnerable populations.

"Reproductive care in the safety net: Women's health after Affordable Care Act implementation (EVERYWOMAN) PROJECT SUMMARY Evidence-based reproductive care decreases morbidity and mortality for women and their children, reduces disparities, and saves money; however, many women do not receive needed reproductive care. Cost and lack of health insurance are known barriers to receiving care, and women who are poor and representative of racial and/or ethnic minorities are least likely to receive needed reproductive care. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) prioritized reproductive health care as an essential component of women's clinical preventive services and called for every state to significantly expand Medicaid coverage by 2014. Little is yet known about how ACA Medicaid expansions are impacting the delivery of reproductive health care. The 2012 United States (US) Supreme Court ruling that made ACA Medicaid expansions optional for states created a natural experiment to answer this important question. As of January, 2016, 31 states and the District of Columbia had expanded Medicaid, while 19 states had not. We will use this unprecedented natural experiment to study the impact of the ACA and Medicaid expansion on the provision of women's reproductive health care in community health centers (CHCs). The proposed Reproductive care in the safety net: Women's health after Affordable Care Act implementation (EVERYWOMAN) project is a mixed-methods study that will leverage patient-level electronic health record (EHR) data from two CHC networks: the Community Health Applied Research Network (CHARN) and the ADVANCE clinical data research network (CDRN). Together, the CHARN and ADVANCE research data warehouses have patient-level data on over 3 million patients from CHCs across 26 states (14 expansion and 12 non-expansion states). These data will be augmented through qualitative data on patient and provider perceptions of the impact of the ACA on reproductive health care in low-income and vulnerable populations. The specific aims are as follows:  Aim 1: Describe provision of women's reproductive health care before and after implementation of the  ACA and between expansion and non-expansion states.  Aim 2: Identify individual, clinic, and state-level factors associated with provision of women's  reproductive health care.  Aim 3: Understand provider and patient perceptions of the provision and utilization of reproductive  health care in low-income and vulnerable populations. This project builds on our team's experience in insurance, primary care, women's health, and utilizing EHR clinical data for research. The ADVANCE and CHARN datasets position us uniquely to study national-level impacts of the ACA. Findings will be relevant to policy and practice, informing efforts to enhance the provision of timely, evidence-based reproductive care, improve health outcomes, and reduce disparities among low- income vulnerable populations of women. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite evidence demonstrating that evidence-based reproductive health care decreases morbidity and mortality for women and their children, reduces disparities, and saves money, many women do not receive needed reproductive health care services, and women who are poor and representative of racial and/or ethnic minorities are least likely to receive needed care. By expanding access to Medicaid and prioritizing women's preventive services, including reproductive health care, the Affordable Care Act has the potential to significantly enhance the provision of reproductive health care, especially in low-income and underserved populations served by community health centers. The proposed project is a mixed-methods study that will leverage patient-level electronic health record (EHR) data from two community health center networks [the Community Health Applied Research Network (CHARN) and the ADVANCE clinical data research network], augmented through qualitative data to explore if and how the ACA and Medicaid expansion have impacted the provision and utilization of reproductive health care services in community health center settings.",Reproductive care in the safety net: Women's health after Affordable Care Act implementation (EVERYWOMAN),9696728,R01HS025155,[''],AHRQ,"OCHIN, INC.",R01,2019,380416,0.09156959957566184
"Impact of Medicare Part D Gap Closure on Health Outcomes The Affordable Care Act (ACA) included provisions to gradually close the Medicare Part D coverage gap (or “doughnut hole”) for prescription drugs. Starting in 2011, drug manufacturers began offering a 50% discount on all brand name drugs for individuals in the coverage gap. Between 2011 and 2020, government subsidies for both brand name and generic drugs will slowly fill in remaining parts of the gap. The coverage gap has led to significant decreases in medication adherence for patients with chronic illness, which has, in turn, resulted in uncontrolled symptoms and adverse health outcomes. As the policy goes into effect, the total annual cost of purchasing medications will decrease for individuals that would have reached the gap under the old policy, which could lead to significant improvements in adherence and health outcomes. Two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries have multiple chronic conditions, and often require treatment with many costly medications. Treatment presents unique challenges in minority patients, who have a higher prevalence of chronic illness, and often require more medications and costlier medications in order to manage their conditions. In this study, we plan to examine whether the closure of the coverage gap leads to real-world improved adherence and health outcomes. Using a 5% national sample of Medicare Claims data from 2006-2017, we will examine the impact of the coverage gap closure on: 1) anticipatory behavior measured by medication adherence across benefit phases and drug types, 2) non-pharmacy healthcare utilization and outcomes and 3) whether the policy led to differential outcomes for racial and ethnic minorities. Our study will use a difference-in-differences approach with nonparametric matching, comparing the impact of the policy between those who previously had coverage in the gap, and those who faced standard benefits. Beneficiaries who received low-income subsidies did not face a coverage gap, and thus will not have any change in benefits as a result of the policy. We will compare these patients to a similar group of near-poor individuals based on a validated census-based SES measure who did not receive subsidies, and thus faced the coverage gap prior to 2010. This study will be the first to examine the impact of the initial coverage gap closure under the ACA, and will provide timely and critical information on the impact how benefit designs with high patient cost sharing influence patient behavior. In addition, we will determine whether the design of the coverage gap resulted in decreases in drug utilization throughout the entire year or only during the coverage gap period, indicating the degree to which individuals are able anticipate future health care spending. This has important implications for understanding behavior under other insurance benefit designs that have different coverage phases (e.g., deductibles, coverage limits). This study will provide important information about how prescription cost-sharing affects healthcare utilization and health outcomes, as well as disparities in these important endpoints, and will provide important information to policy makers about how to design insurance benefits and to lessen the consequences of poor adherence. The closure of the Medicare Part D coverage gap that began in 2011 was intended to provide more comprehensive benefits to Medicare enrollees and to lessen financial strain on those who need to take costly medications. This study will provide important evidence about how much of an impact this policy and similar polices have on medication utilization and health outcomes, as well as disparities in these important endpoints.",Impact of Medicare Part D Gap Closure on Health Outcomes,9783709,R01AG054424,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Censuses ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Deductibles ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Drug Utilization ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' National Government ', ' Federal Government ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Insurance Benefits ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Health Insurance ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Morals ', ' Names ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Privatization ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Government Subsidy ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Police ', ' Drug Costs ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Non-proprietary Drugs ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Services ', ' hazard ', ' Sampling ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Provider ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' treatment compliance ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient cooperation ', ' patient adherence ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' compliance behavior ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Calendar ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' beneficiary ', ' discount ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Medicare claim ', ' non-drug ', ' nondrug ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' racial minority ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' health difference ', ' differences in health ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial stress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial distress ', ' financial burden ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,386582,0.067084503019252
"The Impact of the Recent Medicaid Expansions on Dental Services PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Low-income adults in the US have historically had worse dental health outcomes including untreated caries rates at ~40% and less access to dental care than higher income individuals. Lack of or limited dental coverage among poor adults is thought to be an important factor for oral health disparities by income. Recently, 31 states and Washington DC expanded their Medicaid eligibility to all nonelderly adults with income below 138% FPL, with 24 of these states expanding on January 1 2014. These expansions have substantially increased Medicaid coverage among low income nonelderly adults including by nearly 10 percentage points in 2015. Twelve states of these expanding states are offering extensive dental coverage for the newly eligible adults, and another 11 states and DC are offering limited dental coverage. The Medicaid expansions in these states suggest that newly eligible adults have increased access to dental coverage and services. However, the extent to which the increased dental coverage have resulted in changes in access and use of dental services is an empirical question that has not been adequately addressed. Our goal in this study is to provide causal evidence on the effects of the recent Medicaid expansions in states offering extensive or limited dental coverage for the newly eligible low-income adults on use of dental preventive services and treatments over multiple years post the expansion. In addition to examining differences in effect by state Medicaid generosity of dental coverage, we will also evaluate differences in expansion effects by availability of dental care providers, since areas with more constrained dentist supply may experience smaller effects. We will employ quasi-experimental designs and nationally representative data to estimate these effects. The study findings will be of direct relevance for informing policymakers and other stakeholders about the effectiveness of the recent Medicaid expansions in modifying access to dental care and oral health outcomes among poor nonelderly adults and can be useful for future policies. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will shed light on how recent increase in Medicaid coverage in certain states have affected access to and use of dental services among low income nonelderly adults.

"Effects of Affordable Care Act Medicaid Expansion on Disparities in Trauma Care and Outcomes in Young Adults Project Summary/Abstract  Trauma is the leading cause of death and disability among young adults in the United States. Trauma affects all segments of the US population, but large disparities exist in access to high quality trauma care and outcomes after injury. Among young adults, uninsured patients, patients who reside in low income communities, and black patients have higher risk-adjusted rates of in-hospital mortality. Low income and black and Hispanic patients are also less likely to receive rehabilitative care after injury. These socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities are reduced among insured patients. Prior to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), more than 20% of hospitalized trauma patients were uninsured, with this proportion being much higher among low income and racial/ethnic minority patients. Medicaid expansion through the ACA was implemented to increase health insurance coverage among low income adults. It has reduced the percentage of trauma patients who are uninsured. However, its effects nationally on the known socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities that exist in trauma care and outcomes remain unclear. Lack of insurance is not the only mechanism underlying these disparities as being uninsured is correlated with numerous factors that may independently affect trauma outcomes, such as poorer pre-injury health status, greater treatment delay, provider bias, and treatment at lower resourced hospitals. However, evidence for the direct impact of insurance coverage on disparities in trauma outcomes comes from populations with universal insurance coverage such as the elderly and military personnel, in whom these disparities are not seen. Further research is needed to understand the effect of ACA Medicaid expansion on racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in trauma care and outcomes and elucidate the mechanisms by which this policy may have reduced these disparities. This project will utilize 2010-2017 State Inpatient and State Emergency Department Databases from 18 US states as well as data on hospital structural and financial characteristics to evaluate the effect of ACA Medicaid expansion on socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in trauma care and outcomes among young adults hospitalized for injury. We aim to evaluate whether ACA Medicaid expansion has mitigated disparities in in- hospital mortality, transfer patterns, unplanned readmissions, and access to rehabilitative care after serious injury for Non-Hispanic black patients, Hispanic patients, and patients from low income communities. We also aim to determine what types of hospitals have experienced the largest improvements in outcomes among their minority and low socioeconomic status young adult trauma patients. This project will provide policy makers and healthcare providers with a clear picture of the impact of health insurance expansion to low income adults on racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in trauma outcomes. With the federal government and states debating a variety of changes to Medicaid, this project will provide timely information on the potential effects of such policies on the hundreds of thousands of young adults seriously injured in the US each year. Project Narrative  Among young adults, patients who are uninsured, reside in low income areas, or are black or Hispanic have worse outcomes after serious injury. Prior to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), more than 20% of hospitalized trauma patients were uninsured, with this proportion being much higher among low income and racial/ethnic minority patients.

"National estimates of the impact of the affordable care act on healthcare utilization, outcomes and quality among hispanics A central policy assumption in the U.S. today is that expanding health insurance coverage will improve access to health care, improve health outcomes, and make each more equitable for all Americans. Despite its uncertain future, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, ""the most important legislation in health care since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid"", holds great promise for reducing racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare access and population health.  With the objective of evaluating the impact of the 2014 ACA coverage expansion on racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare access, utilization, outcomes and quality, the proposed study has three foci. First, we will examine measures based on actual healthcare inpatient and emergency department (ED) utilization. Second, to better focus on Hispanics, the largest racial/ethnic minority with higher uninsurance rate (41%) than among non-Hispanic whites (15%), non-Hispanic blacks (21%) and Asians (26%), we will develop a near-national database by combining state inpatient discharge data from 22 states that together account for over 88 percent of the national Hispanic population; corresponding ED data is available from a subset of 13 states. Third, far from being an uniform intervention, ACA expansion engendered wide variation in implementation, particularly across states; we will evaluate how reform effects among Hispanics are modified by language barriers, national origin, baseline uninsurance, state Medicaid generosity, and provider availability.  To estimate changes associated with the 2014 ACA insurance expansion by race/ethnicity, we will use a difference-in-differences design, wherein pre-expansion (2010-2013) to post-expansion (2014-2017) changes in the study outcome measures are contrasted with those in a comparison cohort that experienced no insurance expansion. Our specific aims are to estimate the changes associated with ACA coverage expansion in rates of (1) ambulatory care sensitive condition admissions and ED visits, (2) major elective procedures, (3) inpatient mortality and 30-day readmission, and (4) use of safety-net hospitals vs. non- safety-net hospitals, and disparities in such rates by race/ethnicity. We will examine changes in outcomes among subgroups of Hispanics by English language proficiency, national origin, sex and socioeconomic status.  Our proposal has unique strengths: the data used represents a near-national population of Hispanics; it delineates impact across vulnerable subgroups of Hispanics; it identifies the role of potential facilitating and inhibiting factors, such as, provider availability and state Medicaid policy. Despite its uncertain future, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) holds great promise for reducing racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare access and population health. Using administrative inpatient and emergency department data (2010-2017) from 22 states that account for 88% of national Hispanic population, this study will examine the impact of the 2014 ACA coverage expansion on healthcare access, utilization, patient outcomes and quality of care among those aged 19-64, comparing the changes among Hispanics vs. other racial/ethnic groups. It will also evaluate how these effects among Hispanics are modified by sex, national origin, English language proficiency, baseline uninsurance, state Medicaid generosity, and provider availability.","National estimates of the impact of the affordable care act on healthcare utilization, outcomes and quality among hispanics",9689101,R01MD011594,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Future ', ' stomach bypass ', ' Gastric Bypass ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hysterectomy ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Language ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Medicaid ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Measures ', ' National origin ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' total knee arthroplasty ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' knee replacement arthroplasty ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Elective Surgical Procedures ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' English Language ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' cohort ', ' hospital readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' re-admission ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' sex ', ' inpatient service ', ' inpatient care ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' population health ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' ']",NIMHD,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,692648,0.12788924795399254
"Assessing the Potential for a State Medicaid Reform Model to Reduce Disparities Project Summary: Provisions in the Affordable Care Act allow states substantial flexibility and opportunity to restructure their Medicaid programs. Given the disproportionate share of racial and ethnic minorities areas covered by the Medicaid program, changes in Medicaid policy provide a unique opportunity to address health disparities. However, Medicaid policies also face significant challenges, particularly in the ways in which this relatively low-reimbursing insurance program has left beneficiaries with problems of access and quality. One of the more ambitious Medicaid transformations has occurred in Oregon, which launched its system of “Coordinated Care Organizations,” or CCOs, in 2012. In legislation outlining the CCO model, the State of Oregon explicitly identified “Health Equity and Eliminating Health Disparities” as a fundamental target for delivery system changes. CCOs are required to: submit Community Health Improvement Plans, with goals for reducing disparities; provide services geographically located close to where members reside and offered in nontraditional settings that are accessible to diverse communities and underserved populations; provide incentives to attract underrepresented minority groups into the healthcare workforce; and broaden the use of community health workers. Using extensive claims and Electronic Health Record data and building on large policy experiment in Oregon, this proposal aims to assess the ways in which racial and ethnic disparities can be reduced through Medicaid reform, while also tracking the extent to which access and quality change for rural populations and the Medicaid program at large during these significant reform and expansion periods. Project Narrative/Relevance: This study evaluates the role of Medicaid in reducing disparities for racial and ethnic minorities. Using a policy experiment in Oregon, this study will provide critical information on the effectiveness of reforms that target the reduction of disparities, as well as measuring the effectiveness of community health workers and related approaches that can be adopted across Medicaid programs.

"Gender Disparities in Access and Engagement in Medication-Assisted Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  In response to PAR-18-747, Addressing the Challenges of the Opioid Epidemic in Minority Health and Health Disparities Research in the U.S. (R01), we propose longitudinal analyses of gender difference in entry, access, and engagement in medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD). Our study team includes leading experts in gender disparities (Drs. Marsh and Grella), MAT access (Drs. Guerrero and Hortensia Amaro) and advanced longitudinal approaches (Drs. Kong and Hedeker). We will draw from unique multiyear, program- and client-level data from before (2011-2013) and after (2015-2017) Medicaid expansion to detect disparities and examine the role of risks to women, program capacity, and comprehensive services in eliminating disparities overtime. In Aim 1, we will detect gender differences in trends in treatment entry (clients with OUD), access (wait time), and engagement (retention and dropout risk) in Los Angeles County from 2011- 2017. This will provide the first-known evidence of gender-based trends in treatment entry, access, and engagement in MAT in one the largest publicly funded treatment systems in the United States. In Aim 2, we will seek to understand differences between men and women and among women with OUDs by risk profiles and program factors across key outcomes of treatment access and engagement. This will provide the first-known evidence of differential pathways for women and men to access and engage in MAT programs. In Aim 3, we will examine the effect of Medicaid expansion on women with OUDs, controlling for client risk profiles and program capacity, across outcomes of treatment entry, access, and engagement. This work will document the impact of Medicaid expansion on women's MAT entry, access and engagement. Our findings will inform health care policies and practices and advance systems science and practice guidelines to enhance access to and engagement in care for women with OUD, one of the most vulnerable populations affected by the current opioid epidemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The opioid epidemic disproportionately affects women, racial and ethnic minorities, and other vulnerable groups.

"Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages PROJECT ABSTRACT Health insurance has been at the forefront of US public policy debate throughout the last decade. For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965. Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be a controversial definition. Some decisions about what Medicare should cover have engendered intense debate, underscoring the importance of the program’s coverage decisions for millions of patients and doctors. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. Yet, despite the importance of decisions about the scope of insurance coverage in and outside of Medicare, we know little about how the scope of coverage (as opposed to patient cost-sharing), affects treatment choices, clinical practice, and health outcomes for the elderly. The research outlined in this proposal aims to start filling this gap. The project investigates how the presence or lack of insurance coverage for specific procedural or pharmacologic therapies affects treatment decisions and health outcomes for the elderly with Alzheimer’s Disease and related Dementias (ADRD). This is a population that may be particularly vulnerable to changes and limits in insurance coverage, as the patients may have limited decision-making capacity and may be disproportionately exposed to treatments that are deemed experimental and lacking effectiveness to clear the “reasonable and necessary” threshold. Aim 1 of the project is to estimate the average effect of coverage decisions across prescription drugs and outpatient procedures on treatment decisions and health outcomes of elderly Medicare enrollees with ADRD. Aim 2 is to predict and characterize the subgroups of ADRD patients that are most likely to be affected by decisions that restrict the scope of insurance coverage using machine learning methods. The proposed empirical method is to use quasi- experimental variation that arises from natural experiments of abrupt changes in insurance coverage within different parts of the Medicare program. The analysis takes advantage of variation in the scope of formularies across Medicare Part D plans, as well as the variation in local coverage decisions for physician services and outpatient procedures under Medicare Part B. These sources of variation coupled with methods for quasi- experimental estimation of treatment effects and machine learning methods for heterogeneity analyses, allow estimating the response of treatment decisions and health of the elderly with ADRD across different drugs, procedures, and subgroups of ADRD patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965 - Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but nevertheless incomplete as by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be hard to define. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. In this project I investigate how changes in coverage for prescription drugs, physician office visits, and outpatient procedures affect the treatment received by elderly patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD), who often face coverage limitations due to experimental nature of many ADRD treatments, and yet may be most vulnerable to unintended consequences of any coverage restrictions.",Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages,9742306,K01AG059843,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Anxiety ', ' Barbiturates ', ' Benzodiazepines ', ' Benzodiazepine Compounds ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Formularies ', ' bone fracture ', ' Fracture ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Heart ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Health Insurance ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' physician office visit ', ' Office Visits ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Physicians ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Public Policy ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Extended Care Facilities ', ' Skilled Nursing Facilities ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' SMI Program ', ' Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance Program ', ' Medicare Part B ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Therapeutic procedure ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Gerontology ', ' biogerontology ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Universal Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' bariatric surgery ', ' weight loss surgery ', ' stomach stapling ', ' obesity surgery ', ' implantable gastric stimulation banding ', ' gastric bypass surgery ', ' gastric banding ', ' Family Physicians ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' treatment effect ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' alternative treatment ', ' patient population ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' decision-making capacity ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' precision medicine ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Learning Skill ', ' treatment choice ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' high dimensionality ', ' insurance claims ', ' public health insurance ', ' public insurance ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' ']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,126700,0.12444382502025936
"Multi-level factors affecting postpartum sterilization Female sterilization, the second most commonly used contraceptive method in the United States, is commonly performed during the postpartum period. However, women with Medicaid insurance are half as likely to obtain a desired postpartum sterilization as those with private insurance. Compounding this disparity, women of color with Medicaid insurance are less likely to achieve sterilization fulfillment compared to white women with Medicaid insurance. Sterilization non-fulfillment puts women at high risk of subsequent unintended pregnancy with a short interpregnancy interval and the associated risks to maternal and infant health. There are significant policy barriers to equitable postpartum sterilization that impact those with Medicaid but not private insurance. However, the federal Medicaid policy (including specific consent form and subsequent thirty- day waiting period) was established in 1976 due to coerced sterilizations on women of color and low socioeconomic status. Therefore, sensitive consideration of the complex social and cultural backdrop is required to balance protection of a vulnerable population with the unintended consequence of disparities in sterilization fulfillment. Furthermore, barriers at the patient, provider, and hospital level have also been noted, though it is unclear the extent to which these barriers interact. Advocating for the complete removal of the Medicaid sterilization process, then, ignores both the complex history as well as the additional, non-policy barriers to equitable postpartum sterilization. The overall objective for this proposal is to determine the discrete barriers at various levels of analysis (patient, provider, hospital, and policy). The central hypothesis is that the layering of barriers individually and collectively contributes to disparities in postpartum sterilization fulfillment for the Medicaid population. The rationale for the project is that identifying and understanding potential barriers is the critical next step to eradicating the disparities surrounding postpartum sterilization. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested through an explanatory sequential mixed methods design by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Model the association between Medicaid insurance and sterilization fulfillment after adjusting for clinical and demographic differences in a pooled multi-institution sample (patient- and policy- level barriers aim); 2) Identify the attitudes, beliefs, and practices of postpartum women and their obstetricians regarding postpartum sterilization (patient-, provider-, hospital-, and policy-level barriers aim); 3) Assess the impact of hospital and state policy barriers on postpartum sterilization (hospital- and policy-level barriers aim). The approach is innovative because it departs from the status quo by shifting focus away from studying barriers individually and toward the identification and assessment of various layers of barriers. This contribution will be significant because it is expected to inform an evidence-based and patient-centered health policy to eradicate health disparities and improve clinical outcomes due to sterilization non-fulfillment and resultant unintended pregnancies. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the systematic identification and assessment of barriers to postpartum sterilization is necessary to ensure equitable fulfillment of desired postpartum contraception. Lack of fulfillment to desired postpartum sterilization and the resultant unintended, short-interval pregnancies lead to disparities in clinical and public health outcomes for women of color and low socioeconomic status. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission in understanding factors affecting the non-use of contraception, developing effective interventions, and mitigating disparities in reproductive health.",Multi-level factors affecting postpartum sterilization,9883068,R01HD098127,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Alabama ', ' Attitude ', ' Belief ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' California ', ' Color ', ' Consent Forms ', ' Consent Documents ', ' Informed Consent Documents ', ' Informed Consent Forms ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Female Sterilization ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' State Hospitals ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birth weight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birthweight ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Operating Rooms ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Postpartum Women ', ' Post-partum Women ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Pregnancy Interval ', ' Prenatal care ', ' pregnancy care ', ' prenatal appointment ', ' prenatal checkup ', ' prenatal visit ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Postpartum ', ' post-partum ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' Premature Birth ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Infant Health ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Policies ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' preference ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' Contraception ', ' Fertility Control ', ' Inhibition of Fertilization ', ' Contraceptive methods ', ' social ', ' Abscission ', ' Extirpation ', ' Removal ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' resection ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Paternalism ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Unplanned pregnancy ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' pregnant ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' federal policy ', ' Sterilization ', ' infant morbidity/mortality ', ' maternal morbidity ', ' individual patient ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' post-partum contraception ', ' post-partum contraceptive ', ' postpartum contraceptive ', ' postpartum contraception ', ' ']",NICHD,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,562127,0.07854531376914183
"Improving Minority Health by Monitoring Medicaid Quality, Disparities and Value PROJECT SUMMARY Treating individuals with schizophrenia requires a broad array of services, including physical health care services, which are primarily financed by Medicaid. Despite high health care costs, most patients do not receive recommended care, and minorities are less likely to do so than whites. Moreover, where patients live matters, with quality and quality disparities varying not just among states but also among counties within states. At a time of reform and fiscal constraint, Medicaid programs are challenged with improving quality and reducing quality disparities among high-needs beneficiaries, including those with schizophrenia, at no extra costs. Factors likely to impact a program’s success include its ability to 1) comprehensively measure quality of care, capturing key domains of both mental health and physical health care, 2) validly and feasibly measure the value of care routinely delivered to their beneficiaries, and importantly, 3) incorporate racial/ethnic disparities in the assessment of value. Such measurement efforts should be undertaken at the level of meaningful geographic units such as counties, where patterns of health care are influenced by policies reflecting both state and local priorities. In response to FOA 16-221, we propose a program of research that seeks to reduce health disparities and improve the health of minority populations served in publicly funded settings through measurement of quality disparities and other critical domains of Medicaid-financed care delivered to adults with schizophrenia living in five diverse states. We will measure quality using evidence- based indicators, and exploiting psychometric principles, we will create an overall composite score as well as key sub-scores. Using the composite measure, we will assess racial/ethnic and geographic disparities in overall quality of care; value, defined as the cost to the Medicaid state program of producing high-quality care; and the cost to the program of eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in quality. We will integrate quality and costs through a unique cost-effectiveness methodology, and to our knowledge, our work will be the first to quantitatively link disparities and costs of serious mental illness care. Our ultimate goal is to provide policymakers with a user-friendly interactive tool to monitor quality, quality disparities, costs, and value, thus enabling evidence-based policymaking. Aim 1 will assess racial/ethnic and geographic disparities in quality of mental health, physical health, and overall health care routinely delivered to beneficiaries with schizophrenia. Aim 2 will develop and implement a cost-effectiveness framework to assess value, operationalized as the incremental net monetary benefit of care. Aim 3 will use the statewide white population as a reference standard to determine the cost of eliminating racial/ethnic quality disparities in each county. Aim 4 will develop and pilot a user-friendly interactive tool to enable state Medicaid programs to monitor quality, disparities, costs, and value of care. We expect that the proposed research will contribute to the eradication of disparities through advanced performance measurement techniques that will enable routine monitoring of Medicaid care. Project Narrative The proposed research has high public health relevance because (1) we focus on Medicaid beneficiaries with schizophrenia, a seriously ill population for whom access to high-quality care may be transformative, yet poor quality as well as quality disparities can lead to personal and societal suffering, premature mortality, and high costs, and (2) we seek to substantially expand and develop first evidence on overall quality of care, including physical health care; disparities in quality of care, both racial/ethnic and geographic; value of care, or the cost to the Medicaid state program of producing high-quality care; and the costs of eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in quality. Moreover, through the development of a monitoring tool that will be made available to state Medicaid programs, we will enable evidence-based policy-making aimed at improving care for this vulnerable population.","Improving Minority Health by Monitoring Medicaid Quality, Disparities and Value",9911999,R01MD012428,"['beneficiary ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' severe mental illness ', ' Health Care Fees ', ' charges for health care ', ' charges for healthcare ', ' Healthcare Fees ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' user-friendly ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' routine care ', ' interactive tool ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' care costs ', ' socio-demographic factors ', ' sociodemographic factors ', ' cost estimation ', ' cost estimate ', ' budget impact ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Budgets ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Sources ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Foundations ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Locales ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Policy Making ', ' Psychometrics ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' State Government ', ' Provincial Government ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Managed Care ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Services ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' ']",NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2020,731964,0.1063541441998683
"Medicaid Value Based Payment Models and Healthcare Equity for Adults with Serious Mental Illnesses Project Summary/Abstract In order to improve health outcomes while reducing costs, Medicaid Value Based Payment (VBP) models reward providers for quality. Early evidence from state agencies suggests that Medicaid VBP models had moderate success in meeting their health and economic targets for the average beneficiary. However, despite the fact Medicaid is a critical payer for costly healthcare needed by adults with Serious Mental Illness (SMI), little is known about VBP effects on Medicaid beneficiaries with SMI, especially those belonging to racial/ethnic minority groups. Our research team and others have documented significant disparities in access, quality, and outcomes of healthcare for Black and Latino relative to White adults with SMI. We and others have also shown that policies with average beneficial effects for people with mental illnesses may not benefit everyone equally—e.g., we demonstrated that while the Affordable Care Act improved access to mental healthcare, it had no impact on the wide racial/ethnic disparities in access to mental health treatment. The challenges of navigating service delivery changes in VBP may be greater for people with SMI and for minority patients due to poorer baseline healthcare access and quality and their greater social disadvantage. A lack of data on the equity impacts of VBP for racial/ethnic minorities with SMI is a crucial evidentiary gap. We propose to evaluate the impact of VBP models on racial/ethnic disparities in mental health treatment among patients with SMI. We will use longitudinal 2010-2019 Medicaid claims from Oregon and New York, two states that have implemented hybrid VBP models targeting both providers and managed care organizations, and link these data to national provider data and area-level characteristics. For each state, we evaluate (a) the overall impact of VBP models as well as (b) investigate the impact of different VBP models within states (i.e., the differential impact on disparities attributed to variation in how managed care organizations contracted with providers). Our primary analyses estimate the differential impact of VBP implementation, among Medicaid beneficiaries with SMI, by race/ethnicity (White, Black, or Hispanic/Latino) for healthcare: (Aim 1) access, (Aim 2) quality, (Aim 3) effectiveness, and (Aim 4) costs. The proposed research will provide meaningful evidence to states considering VBP adoption. It is consistent with NIMH Strategic Objective 4.1 (Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of existing mental health services through research), and seeks to fill the evidentiary gap in the effects of state policies on equitable health care for individuals living with SMI. Narrative Early evidence from state agencies suggests that Medicaid Value-Based Payment (VBP) models had moderate success in meeting health and economic targets for the average beneficiary, yet little is known about VBP effects on service use for Medicaid beneficiaries with Serious Mental Illness (SMI), especially those belonging to racial/ethnic minority groups. We propose to analyze 2010-2019 Medicaid claims from Oregon and New York, evaluating VBP impacts on racial/ethnic disparities in physical and mental health treatment access (Aim 1), quality (Aim 2), effectiveness (Aim 3), and costs (Aim 4) for patients with SMI.

"Association of Health Insurance with Access to Cardiovascular Care PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality disproportionately impact lower income individuals and racial minorities. These groups are also significantly less likely to have health insurance coverage in the United States. There is growing evidence that expansion of health insurance coverage in low-income populations can lead to improvements in health outcomes. In a recently published analysis by Dr. Khatana and colleagues, that serves as the preliminary analysis for the proposed research, expansion of insurance coverage through Medicaid was associated with fewer deaths from cardiovascular disease. A possible mechanism by which this occurred is improved access to cardiovascular care, however, this has not been previously studied. This proposed research plan aims to understand whether expansion of insurance coverage impacts access to inpatient and outpatient care for cardiovascular disease, and whether it narrows disparities in care access for racial minorities. Aim 1 seeks to examine whether expansion of insurance coverage through Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act led to an increase in access to inpatient care in the setting of acute myocardial infarction or stroke, and whether this varied between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White individuals. Aim 2 will investigate whether access to outpatient care for chronic cardiovascular disease is associated with changes in insurance coverage and whether insurance expansion narrows racial disparities in outpatient access. These two aims will utilize different large administrative claims databases. Aim 3 will augment these analyses by employing qualitative research methods to interview low-income patients discharged after a cardiovascular hospitalization. Patients in the post-discharge period are especially vulnerable to adverse outcomes such as readmission or death. Therefore, uninsured and insured patients will be interviewed to understand whether insurance status is associated with differences in health seeking behaviors, adherence to medical advice and therapies, health status and outcomes. These aims will lead to a future multi-site cohort study of low-income individuals with cardiovascular disease, which will be used to prospectively investigate how changes in health insurance coverage impact cardiovascular outcomes. Dr. Khatana, an early career investigator and a fellow in cardiovascular medicine, has a long-term goal of becoming an independently funded cardiovascular health policy and outcomes researcher with a focus on how health policies impact the cardiovascular health of low- income individuals using both large administrative databases as well as qualitative methods at the individual level. These research aims are part of a comprehensive training plan and will be supervised by a mentorship and advisory team consisting of national leaders in health outcomes and policy research, and advanced statistical and qualitative methodologies, and will guide his transition to an independently funded research career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Low-income individuals, especially those who are racial minorities, in the US have a disproportionately higher burden of cardiovascular disease, and also have lower rates of health insurance coverage. This study aims to understand whether health insurance coverage for low-income individuals is associated with improvements in access to inpatient and outpatient cardiovascular care, improvements in racial disparities in care access, as well as care after discharge from a cardiovascular hospitalization. The findings of this study will help understand the mechanisms by which recent expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act was associated with improved cardiovascular mortality, as well as inform future health policies seeking to improve cardiovascular outcomes.",Association of Health Insurance with Access to Cardiovascular Care,10039560,K23HL153772,"['Affect ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Behavior ', ' Cardiology ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Federal Government ', ' National Government ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Improving Minority Health by Monitoring Medicaid Quality, Disparities and Value PROJECT SUMMARY Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness associated with a high burden of disease due to severe disability and premature mortality largely driven by co-occurring chronic medical conditions that shorten life expectancy by at least 20 years. The broad array of services needed by this population are primarily financed by Medicaid. Despite high costs, most patients do not receive recommended care, and minorities are less likely to do so than whites. These pre-existing disparities and the profound social disadvantage also experienced by this population make them particularly vulnerable to the devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which in the US has been particularly severe in the state of New York. New Yorkers with schizophrenia, and minorities in particular, are not only a high-risk group for poorer COVID-19 outcomes but they may also experience declines in their health due to disruptions in their ability to access healthcare. Although New York’s Medicaid program authorized the use of telehealth to mitigate those disruptions soon after the Governor declared a State of Emergency in early March 2020, the degree to which telehealth has been adopted by Medicaid providers serving seriously mentally ill people and whether the effects of telehealth adoption may vary by race/ethnicity are not well known. Our proposed administrative supplement application builds on our ongoing NIMHD-funded parent study (MD012428), which seeks to reduce healthcare disparities and thus improve health outcomes of racial/ethnic minority populations through measurement of quality disparities and value (or cost-effectiveness) of Medicaid-financed care delivered to adults with schizophrenia. Consistent with the NIMHD’s Notice of Special Interest calling for studies of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on health disparity populations, we propose to evaluate the effects of the outbreak on the racially/ethnically diverse population of Medicaid beneficiaries with schizophrenia living in New York. In Aim 1, we will assess the effect of the outbreak on racial/ethnic disparities in access, quality, and effectiveness of mental and physical healthcare delivered to our study population. In Aim 2, we will assess Medicaid providers’ responses to the outbreak and their effects on healthcare disparities in our study population. We will characterize provider response through a measure of provider readiness to adopt telehealth. Our general approach to assessing the impact of the outbreak on healthcare outcomes and the impact of provider responses on those outcomes will involve the use of post-pre outbreak differences, interrupted time series approaches, as well as approaches that utilize time-varying coefficients. In all analyses, our primary interest are parameters that describe how race/ethnicity moderates the outbreak’s effect on outcomes and the providers’ responses on outcomes. We expect that our work will provide policymakers with a better understanding of the impacts of the outbreak on vulnerable populations and enable the design of more effective policies to address this and future crises. Project Narrative The proposed supplemental research has high public health relevance because we propose to study the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the healthcare received by adult Medicaid beneficiaries with schizophrenia, a socially disadvantaged population with a high disease burden whose care has been shown to be of low quality and in addition, encumbered by racial/ethnic disparities. We seek to assess disparities in quality of both mental and physical healthcare and also access and effectiveness of healthcare, and evaluate providers’ use of telehealth and the effect of telehealth adoption on preexisting racial/ethnic disparities. We expect that our work will allow policymakers to gain a better understanding of the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak and enable the design of more effective policies to address this and future crises.","Improving Minority Health by Monitoring Medicaid Quality, Disparities and Value",10169888,R01MD012428,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Sources ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Future ', ' General Practitioners ', ' Generalists ', ' Health ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentally Ill Persons ', ' Mental Patients ', ' Mentally Ill ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' New York ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' dementia praecox ', ' schizophrenic ', ' Time ', ' Antipsychotic Agents ', ' Antipsychotic Drugs ', ' Antipsychotics ', ' Major Tranquilizers ', ' Major Tranquilizing Agents ', ' Neuroleptic Agents ', ' Neuroleptic Drugs ', ' Neuroleptics ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' State Interests ', ' Guidelines ', ' health care costs financing ', ' health care financing ', ' healthcare cost/financing ', ' healthcare costs financing ', ' healthcare financing ', ' health care cost/financing ', ' improved ', ' psychiatric care ', ' psychiatric therapy ', ' psychiatric treatment ', ' Psychiatric therapeutic procedure ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Country ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' telehealth ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Interruption ', ' Subgroup ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' beneficiary ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' severe mental illness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' effectiveness measure ', ' evidence base ', ' Medical emergency ', ' study population ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' psychiatric emergency ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' social disadvantage ', ' acute care ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' ']",NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2020,197215,0.13754889785857205
"Using Satellite National Health Accounts to Understand Health and Cost Changes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Though health expenditures in the U.S. are carefully tracked by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the health outcomes associated with these expenditures are not. To address this need, our past research has developed detailed measures of population health and medical spending using existing national data, in order to systematically and jointly measure the benefits and the costs of medical care. These methods have been developed to serve as a Satellite National Health Account, enabling a better understanding of the health sector in the United States. We propose two new avenues of analysis using these tools that will greatly expand our understanding of health change in relation to costs across the U.S. population. The first is to examine health in conjunction with costs among all age groups- -including the elderly, middle-aged, young adults, and children-and among different socioeconomic groups. The second is to examine the health of those with different diseases, and understand specifically how it has changed over time in terms of the relationship of each disease to health and medical spending. A major output of the project is the production of a satellite National Health Account for the U.S. population as a whole, that gives critical information on health outcomes and medical expenditures for specific diseases over time, overall and among different sociodemographic groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will result in a National Health Account for the whole U.S. population, providing detailed information on health in conjunction with medical expenditures-overall, among those with different diseases, and in different socioeconomic groups.

"Reducing Postpartum Health Care Disparities through Increased Insurance Coverage after Childbirth PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Steenland’s long-term career goal is to become an independent policy researcher generating evidence to improve maternal health in the US. African American women are more likely than white women to experience severe maternal morbidity and mortality. As Medicaid covers a disproportionally large share of African American and Hispanic women during pregnancy, the program plays a critical role in their maternal health. However, many women covered by Medicaid during pregnancy lose coverage at 60 days postpartum. US policy makers are considering policy options to reduce disparities in maternal mortality, including extending Medicaid pregnancy coverage from 60 days to one year postpartum. However, the effect of increased Medicaid coverage on postpartum health care use and health outcomes is not known. Dr. Steenland will examine the role of Medicaid expansion on disparities in postpartum insurance coverage, health care access, and health outcomes among recently pregnant women. She will use data from the American Community Survey and the Arkansas All-Payers Claims Database to pursue the following research aims: (1) Evaluate the effect of Medicaid expansion on racial/ethnic disparities in postpartum insurance coverage nationally; (2) Examine the effect of Medicaid expansion on disparities in postpartum care and health outcomes between African American and non-Hispanic white women in Arkansas, the state with the largest gains in postpartum insurance coverage after Medicaid expansion. These studies will provide much needed evidence to US policy makers about the effect of increased postpartum insurance coverage on health care utilization and outcomes. The proposed research builds upon Dr. Steenland’s prior research on the effects of Medicaid reimbursement for immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraception on postpartum contraceptive use and birth intervals. She will pursue the following K01 training aims to prepare her for the proposed research and for her career goals: (1) Acquire training in obstetrics and maternal health; (2) Acquire training in domestic health policy; (3) Acquire advanced training in econometric methods for health policy evaluation. To achieve these training goals, Dr. Steenland has assembled a team of mentors at Brown University, led by Dr. Amal Trivedi, Professor in the School of Public Health’s Department of Health Services, Policy, and Practice; Dr. Ira Wilson, Professor and Chair of the Department of Health Services, Policy, and Practice; Dr. David Savitz, Professor in the Department of Epidemiology in the School of Public Health; Dr. Kristen Matteson, Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Dr. Anna Aizer, Professor and Chair of the Department of Economics. Dr. Steenland’s training will prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator working to reduce disparities and improve maternal health through health policy research. NARRATIVE African American women are disproportionally covered by Medicaid and are at greater risk than non-Hispanic white women of losing insurance coverage after pregnancy and of poor maternal health outcomes. Dr. Steenland will train in domestic health policy, maternal health, and advanced econometric methods to prepare her to complete her research aims and for a career as an independent investigator focused on health policy solutions to reduce poor maternal health outcomes among racial/ethnic minority women. In the proposed research aims, Dr. Steenland will examine the effect of Medicaid expansion on disparities in postpartum insurance coverage nationally, and the effect of Medicaid expansion in Arkansas, the state with the largest coverage gains after Medicaid expansion, on disparities in postpartum health care use in Arkansas.",Reducing Postpartum Health Care Disparities through Increased Insurance Coverage after Childbirth,10126597,K01HS027464,[''],AHRQ,BROWN UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,143008,0.12647604951726205
"ACCESS: Assessing Community Cancer care after insurance ExpanSionS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer morbidity and mortality is greatly reduced through screening and prevention, but uninsured patients are much less likely than insured patients to receive these evidence-based services as recommended. Similarly, uninsured cancer survivors receive fewer primary and preventive care services than those with health insurance. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) called for every state to significantly expand Medicaid coverage by 2014; it is hypothesized that the ACA's Medicaid expansions could substantially (i) improve access to essential cancer preventive and screening services for previously uninsured patients, and (ii) facilitate better access to routine healthcare among cancer survivors who gain new health insurance. Little is yet known about how ACA Medicaid expansions are impacting the delivery of recommended cancer care. The 2012 United States (US) Supreme Court ruling that made ACA Medicaid expansions optional for states created a natural experiment to answer this important question. As of April 1, 2015, 30 states and the District of Columbia had expanded Medicaid, while 20 states had not. We will use this unprecedented natural experiment to study the effect of state-level Medicaid expansions on rates of cancer screening, cancer preventive services, and healthcare for cancer survivors. We will use electronic health record (EHR) data from the ADVANCE clinical data research network, which has data from 718 community health centers (CHCs), including 476 CHCs in 13 Medicaid expansion states and 242 CHCs in 8 non-expansion states. From this dataset, we will collect detailed information on changes in health insurance and healthcare service receipt, with data spanning 9 years (pre- and post-expansion), comparing states that expanded Medicaid, and those that did not. The specific aims are as follows: Aim 1. Compare pre-post receipt of cancer prevention and screening among CHC patients in Medicaid expansion versus non-expansion states. Aim 2. Compare pre-post insurance status, visits, and receipt of routine, recommended primary and preventive care among cancer survivors seen in CHCs in expansion versus non-expansion states. Aim 3. Compare pre-post cancer prevention, screening, and survivor care for newly insured (gained Medicaid in post-period), already insured (had Medicaid coverage in pre- and post-periods), and continuously uninsured (no coverage in pre- and post-periods) CHC patients in states that expanded Medicaid. This project builds on our team's experience studying health insurance, primary care, and receipt of preventive services. The ADVANCE dataset positions us uniquely to study national-level impacts of the ACA. Importantly, this project aligns with National Cancer Institute (NCI) goals to increase knowledge regarding cancer control and prevention. According to the NCI, ""prevention has the potential to save more lives from cancer than treatment...which underlines the importance of strongly supporting this research area."" Also, findings will be relevant to policy and practice, and will inform further improvements in the US healthcare system to mitigate disparities in cancer prevention and survivor care for vulnerable populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Some states implemented Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansions while other states did not, thus creating a natural experiment to study the impact of increased access to health insurance on cancer screening, cancer preventive services, and cancer survivor care. This innovative, timely study will use electronic health record (EHR) data from the ADVANCE clinical data research network (CDRN) of PCORnet, which has EHR data from 718 community health centers (CHCs), including 476 CHCs in 13 states that expanded Medicaid (n=576,711 patients), and 242 CHCs in 8 states that did not expand Medicaid (n=361,421 patients).

"National estimates of the impact of the affordable care act on healthcare utilization, outcomes and quality among hispanics A central policy assumption in the U.S. today is that expanding health insurance coverage will improve access to health care, improve health outcomes, and make each more equitable for all Americans. Despite its uncertain future, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, ""the most important legislation in health care since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid"", holds great promise for reducing racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare access and population health.  With the objective of evaluating the impact of the 2014 ACA coverage expansion on racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare access, utilization, outcomes and quality, the proposed study has three foci. First, we will examine measures based on actual healthcare inpatient and emergency department (ED) utilization. Second, to better focus on Hispanics, the largest racial/ethnic minority with higher uninsurance rate (41%) than among non-Hispanic whites (15%), non-Hispanic blacks (21%) and Asians (26%), we will develop a near-national database by combining state inpatient discharge data from 22 states that together account for over 88 percent of the national Hispanic population; corresponding ED data is available from a subset of 13 states. Third, far from being an uniform intervention, ACA expansion engendered wide variation in implementation, particularly across states; we will evaluate how reform effects among Hispanics are modified by language barriers, national origin, baseline uninsurance, state Medicaid generosity, and provider availability.  To estimate changes associated with the 2014 ACA insurance expansion by race/ethnicity, we will use a difference-in-differences design, wherein pre-expansion (2010-2013) to post-expansion (2014-2017) changes in the study outcome measures are contrasted with those in a comparison cohort that experienced no insurance expansion. Our specific aims are to estimate the changes associated with ACA coverage expansion in rates of (1) ambulatory care sensitive condition admissions and ED visits, (2) major elective procedures, (3) inpatient mortality and 30-day readmission, and (4) use of safety-net hospitals vs. non- safety-net hospitals, and disparities in such rates by race/ethnicity. We will examine changes in outcomes among subgroups of Hispanics by English language proficiency, national origin, sex and socioeconomic status.  Our proposal has unique strengths: the data used represents a near-national population of Hispanics; it delineates impact across vulnerable subgroups of Hispanics; it identifies the role of potential facilitating and inhibiting factors, such as, provider availability and state Medicaid policy. Despite its uncertain future, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) holds great promise for reducing racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare access and population health. Using administrative inpatient and emergency department data (2010-2017) from 22 states that account for 88% of national Hispanic population, this study will examine the impact of the 2014 ACA coverage expansion on healthcare access, utilization, patient outcomes and quality of care among those aged 19-64, comparing the changes among Hispanics vs. other racial/ethnic groups. It will also evaluate how these effects among Hispanics are modified by sex, national origin, English language proficiency, baseline uninsurance, state Medicaid generosity, and provider availability.","National estimates of the impact of the affordable care act on healthcare utilization, outcomes and quality among hispanics",10026531,R01MD011594,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Future ', ' Gastric Bypass ', ' stomach bypass ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hysterectomy ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Language ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Medicaid ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Measures ', ' National origin ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Knee arthroplasty ', ' Knee joint replacement operation ', ' Knee replacement ', ' Total Knee Replacement ', ' total knee arthroplasty ', ' knee replacement arthroplasty ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Elective Surgical Procedures ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' English Language ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' cohort ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' sex ', ' inpatient care ', ' inpatient service ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' population health ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' ']",NIMHD,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,539366,0.12788924795399254
"Linking State Medicaid and Congenital Heart Surgical Registry Data: Building Capacity to Assess Disparities in Longitudinal Outcomes and Value for Children with Congenital Heart Disease Project Summary Congenital heart defects are the most common and resource intensive birth defects managed in the United States with high morbidity and mortality. They are estimated to effect over 1 million US children and 1.4 million US adults and to result in ~200,000 life-years lost and >$6 billion in inpatient acute care costs per year. Significant disparities are known to exist in short-term outcomes and resource utilization. We have shown that children from low income neighborhoods have 18% higher risk-adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality, have 7% longer lengths-of-stay, and require 7% more perioperative resources than do children from higher income neighborhoods, even after controlling for the effects of race, public versus private insurance provider, and the hospitals at which these children ultimately receive surgical repair. Research on long-term outcomes and health expenditures is limited and mechanisms driving health inequities remain unknown. Greater than 50% of children with congenital heart disease are covered by Medicaid. We have partnered with the NY Department of Health and have clean, validated data for all Medicaid patient encounters over 15 years across NY State. We have developed methods of abstracting and linking locally-held clinical registry data to Medicaid files and have built an interdisciplinary team of pediatric cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, health services researchers, health economists, and NY Department of Health senior leadership to identify dimensions of healthcare access that could be targeted through center- or state-level interventions to reduce inequities. We propose linking pediatric cardiac surgical clinical registry data from across NY State, longitudinal Medicaid claims, Census Bureau data, geocoded data, and the National Death Index. We will use these data to accomplish the following Aims: 1) We will define 10-year risk-stratified, multi-dimensional outcomes (mortality and morbidities) and associated health expenditures for children undergoing congenital heart surgery across New York State; 2) we will develop novel longitudinal risk models for children with congenital heart disease that adjust for social determinants of health, and 3) we will test dimensions of healthcare access as modifiable drivers of health inequities among children in New York with congenital heart disease on Medicaid. Achieving our aims would 1) establish a comprehensive, population-based resource for longitudinal outcomes and health expenditure research, inclusive of not only in-patient data, but also out-patient, emergency room, pharmacy, rehabilitation, home healthcare, education records, and neighborhood-level social determinants of health for nearly half of all children undergoing congenital heart surgery in NY State, 2) generate a methodology for investigations on long-term outcomes and value applicable across multiple populations, 3) assess constructs of access as modifiable mediators of social determinants of health, and 4) position us to translate these findings into policy and care changes to reduce health inequities. Project Narrative Congenital heart defects are the most common and resource intensive birth defects managed in the United States, estimated to effect over 1 million US children and 1.4 million US adults and to result in ~200,000 life- years lost and >$6 billion in inpatient acute care costs per year, with significantly worse outcomes for children from lower income neighborhoods and minorities. Despite the high prevalence, research on long-term outcomes and health expenditures is limited and etiologies of health inequities remain unknown. Linking clinical registries with longitudinal state-wide Medicaid data will 1) build a scalable resource that will allow us to assess longitudinal outcomes and resource requirements at a population level 2) generate a methodology for investigations on long-term outcomes and value, 3) assess constructs of access as modifiable mediators of social determinants of health, and 4) immediately inform policy and care.",Linking State Medicaid and Congenital Heart Surgical Registry Data: Building Capacity to Assess Disparities in Longitudinal Outcomes and Value for Children with Congenital Heart Disease,9864807,R01HL150044,"['Congenital Abnormality ', ' Birth Defects ', ' Congenital Anatomic Abnormality ', ' Congenital Anatomical Abnormality ', ' Congenital Defects ', ' Congenital Deformity ', ' Congenital Malformation ', ' abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Base Ratios ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cardiology ', ' Censuses ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Charge ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Mortality ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Expenditure ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Heart ', ' Congenital Heart Defects ', ' Congenital Cardiac Defects ', ' congenital cardiac anomalies ', ' Cardiac Surgery procedures ', ' Cardiac Surgery ', ' Cardiac Surgical Procedures ', ' Heart Surgical Procedures ', ' heart surgery ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Home Care Services ', ' Domiciliary Care ', ' home health care ', ' home healthcare ', ' Hospitals ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Leadership ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Effects of Affordable Care Act Medicaid Expansion on Disparities in Trauma Care and Outcomes in Young Adults Project Summary/Abstract  Trauma is the leading cause of death and disability among young adults in the United States. Trauma affects all segments of the US population, but large disparities exist in access to high quality trauma care and outcomes after injury. Among young adults, uninsured patients, patients who reside in low income communities, and black patients have higher risk-adjusted rates of in-hospital mortality. Low income and black and Hispanic patients are also less likely to receive rehabilitative care after injury. These socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities are reduced among insured patients. Prior to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), more than 20% of hospitalized trauma patients were uninsured, with this proportion being much higher among low income and racial/ethnic minority patients. Medicaid expansion through the ACA was implemented to increase health insurance coverage among low income adults. It has reduced the percentage of trauma patients who are uninsured. However, its effects nationally on the known socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities that exist in trauma care and outcomes remain unclear. Lack of insurance is not the only mechanism underlying these disparities as being uninsured is correlated with numerous factors that may independently affect trauma outcomes, such as poorer pre-injury health status, greater treatment delay, provider bias, and treatment at lower resourced hospitals. However, evidence for the direct impact of insurance coverage on disparities in trauma outcomes comes from populations with universal insurance coverage such as the elderly and military personnel, in whom these disparities are not seen. Further research is needed to understand the effect of ACA Medicaid expansion on racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in trauma care and outcomes and elucidate the mechanisms by which this policy may have reduced these disparities. This project will utilize 2010-2017 State Inpatient and State Emergency Department Databases from 18 US states as well as data on hospital structural and financial characteristics to evaluate the effect of ACA Medicaid expansion on socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in trauma care and outcomes among young adults hospitalized for injury. We aim to evaluate whether ACA Medicaid expansion has mitigated disparities in in- hospital mortality, transfer patterns, unplanned readmissions, and access to rehabilitative care after serious injury for Non-Hispanic black patients, Hispanic patients, and patients from low income communities. We also aim to determine what types of hospitals have experienced the largest improvements in outcomes among their minority and low socioeconomic status young adult trauma patients. This project will provide policy makers and healthcare providers with a clear picture of the impact of health insurance expansion to low income adults on racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in trauma outcomes. With the federal government and states debating a variety of changes to Medicaid, this project will provide timely information on the potential effects of such policies on the hundreds of thousands of young adults seriously injured in the US each year. Project Narrative  Among young adults, patients who are uninsured, reside in low income areas, or are black or Hispanic have worse outcomes after serious injury. Prior to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), more than 20% of hospitalized trauma patients were uninsured, with this proportion being much higher among low income and racial/ethnic minority patients.

"The Impact of Medicaid Plans on Access to and Quality of SUD Treatment PROJECT SUMMARY  Medicaid, the largest health insurance sector in the U.S., with the most vulnerable individuals, is the least- well understood. There is little research on the effects of the structure of state Medicaid programs on access, patterns of care and outcomes of substance use disorder (SUD) care. States provide Medicaid benefits either through publicly managed Fee-for-Service (FFS) systems or by contracting with private Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) plans. Despite widespread adoption of MMC, its role is not well-understood, especially its effects on SUD treatment and service disparities. Little is known about any differences in SUD treatment between traditional FFS Medicaid and private MMC plans or differences across different types of managed care plans with different approaches to SUD treatment. The proposed study makes use of innovative random assignment methods to address this challenge in the Medicaid sector. In the proposed project, we apply a select group of metrics for assessing access, patterns of care and outcomes of SUD treatment, to describe the performance of systems, health plans, and provider groups in New York. We then conduct stratified analysis by race/ethnicity, gender, and rurality to identify which programs and plans have better outcomes and identify if there are service disparities. Our project uses qualitative methods to help interpret our results through in-depth interviews, and to provide insight on the interpretation of findings and suggest practice and policy changes. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Providing effective treatment of substance use disorders is a major public health priority, with increasing recognition of the inadequacy of current treatments for Medicaid populations.

"Higher Reimbursements for Primary Care Services and the Quality of Care for Dually-Eligible Nursing Home Residents with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There are 5.5 million people in the US with Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias (ADRD). Annual health care expenditures for this population are $259 billion with the majority of these costs attributed to ADRD patients receiving long-term care in nursing homes (NHs). Due to the cognitive decline and the behavioral and psychiatric symptoms experienced by ADRD patients, there are few substitutes for long-term care provided by NHs. Nearly two-thirds of NH residents have some degree of ADRD, over 60% of whom are dually-eligible. NH residents with ADRD have high rates of hospitalization (45.8%/year) and emergency department visits (55.3%/year). Up to 80% of these events are associated with ambulatory care sensitive conditions, which are potentially preventable with appropriate primary care in the NH. However, earlier research has indicated that dual-eligibles receive primary care of lower quality than other beneficiaries. Once a patient becomes a long-stay NH resident, the NH physician becomes his/her primary care provider. As the primary care provider, the NH physician is expected to deal with problems as the patient’s dementia progresses, to refer appropriately, to coordinate with other providers, to initiate and follow up on treatment issues, and to work with family members overseeing the patient’s care. The Medicaid Primary Care Fee Bump provides a natural experiment to examine the impact of higher physician reimbursement on the quality of care for dually-eligible NH residents with ADRD. Over a two-year period (2013-2014), the initiative required states’ Medicaid programs to reimburse providers the same rates as Medicare for primary care services for all Medicaid patients. For dual-eligibles, the fee bump required Medicaid programs to reimburse providers the full 20% Medicare coinsurance for primary care services, which included evaluation and management services provided in NHs. Prior to the fee bump and following its expiration, states covered 0 to 20 percentage points of Medicare Part B coinsurance. Using a national sample of all dually-eligible NH residents with ADRD over an eight-year period (2011-2018), this project will take advantage of the natural experiment created by the Medicaid Primary Care Fee Bump to identify the impact of higher reimbursement for primary care services on the quality and cost of care for these beneficiaries. This will be done using two sources of variation: (1) the timing of both the implementation and termination of the fee bump and (2) variation in the states reimbursing physicians the full 20% Medicare coinsurance for dual-eligibles before and after the fee bump. The quasi-experimental nature of the research design will allow estimation strongly indicative of causation and our national sample of all dually-eligible long-stay NH residents with ADRD will help ensure that the results are generalizable. The project will provide highly valuable evidence indicating whether increased reimbursement for primary care services in NHs improves the quality and/or lowers the cost of care for dually-eligible residents with ADRD. This issue has immediate policy relevance as 31 states did not maintain higher reimbursement rates for these services after the fee bump expired at the end of 2014. PROJECT NARRATIVE Using a unique natural experiment, the proposed project will be the first to quantify the impact of higher provider reimbursement for primary care delivered in nursing homes on the quality and cost of care for dually-eligible residents with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). It will also be the first study to quantify the impact of higher reimbursement for primary care services on racial disparities in the quality of care among nursing home residents with ADRD.",Higher Reimbursements for Primary Care Services and the Quality of Care for Dually-Eligible Nursing Home Residents with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias.,9973962,R01AG063935,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' Coinsurance ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Fees ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Medicaid ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Medicare Part B ', ' Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance Program ', ' SMI Program ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' enteric feeding ', ' feeding tube ', ' gastric feeding ', ' tube feeding ', ' Enteral Feeding ', ' Family member ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' expiration ', ' Policies ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Provider ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Characteristics ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' beneficiary ', ' nursing home days ', ' nursing home stay ', ' nursing home length of stay ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' dual eligible ', ' policy implication ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' primary care services ', ' care costs ', ' service coordination ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' ']",NIA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2020,430418,0.011020276900621878
"Work Requirements and Health Care Disparities in Medicaid: A Randomized Controlled Trial Project Summary/Abstract:  Work requirements are becoming increasingly common in major public assistance programs, and starting in 2018, several states have received approval from the federal government to require employment or other qualifying “community engagement activities” to obtain Medicaid coverage. Proponents of work requirements contend that these policies increase beneficiary engagement in work and community activities that may lead to higher incomes and better health. On the other hand, opponents of work requirements suggest that many low-resource households will lose much-needed benefits, without commensurate improvements in employment. More than a dozen states have proposed new Medicaid work requirements in the past year, but there is little rigorous evidence on the effects of these policies in public programs. We propose a randomized controlled trial of work requirements in Virginia, leveraging state support for exempting a portion of Medicaid expansion enrollees from the state's impending work requirements. We will be able to separate the causal impact of enforcing a work requirement from two other new features of Virginia's Medicaid program: additional verification requirements and premiums. Our experimental design will enable us to test for any interactions between work requirements, premiums, and verification requirements. We will study the impacts of each policy on health insurance coverage, access to care, employment, and health outcomes using a mix of administrative data and a new beneficiary survey, and we will oversample several populations of interest, including racial/ethnic minorities and low-income rural residents. In doing so, we will identify the overall policy impacts of these policies, and we will also assess who is most affected by each component to determine the impact of these Medicaid policy changes on racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic disparities. Project Narrative:  More than a dozen states have proposed or plan to implement work requirements in Medicaid, yet evidence on the potential effects of these policies is limited. In 2020, Virginia will begin requiring beneficiaries to participate in at least 80 hours a month of employment or other “community engagement” activities to maintain coverage. With support from the state's Medicaid agency, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial studying the impacts of this policy on coverage, access to care, employment, and health, with a particular focus on changes in racial/ethnic and geographic disparities in these outcomes.",Work Requirements and Health Care Disparities in Medicaid: A Randomized Controlled Trial,9913824,R01MD014970,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Awareness ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' Federal Government ', ' National Government ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Household ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medical Assistance ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Poverty ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Assistance ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Virginia ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' suburban ', ' suburbia ', ' suburb ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' beneficiary ', ' rural disparities ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' waiver ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' outcome prediction ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' rural Americans ', ' rural resident ', ' rural dwellers ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' ']",NIMHD,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2020,558358,0.17348334654618816
"Integrating Social Determinants of Health Into Risk Adjustment Models:  An Opportunity to Improve Care Coordination Strategies For Medicaid Beneficiaries PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this project is to provide evidence of the value of measuring social determinants of health (SDH) in the Medicaid population. This project will demonstrate that risk stratification using traditional risk adjustment models (RAMs) can be improved significantly with the inclusion of SDH information in addition to the information these models typically rely on: age, gender, and medical diagnoses. In addition, this project will quantify incident and cumulative risk of various SDH factors on the onset of incident disease within a one year period, highlighting the need to address social and environmental disadvantages that drive health inequities so that Medicaid can achieve the triple aim: improved care and population health at lower cost. To accomplish our objectives, we will conduct a prospective cohort study that will enroll 9,600 adult Medicaid beneficiaries treated at two medical facilities located in Washington, DC. The study sample will be predominately black (i.e. 90%) with a slightly higher percentage of females (60%). Medicaid beneficiaries who participate will complete a comprehensive SDH assessment during their initial medical encounter that will include validated SDH questions that measure housing stability, food availability, financial strain, health behaviors, social support, etc. Six and 12 months after enrollment, we will conduct a telephone follow-up interview with subjects to determine if there have been any major changes to their social and environmental circumstances. We will merge the interview data with DC Medicaid claims data (two years pre and one year post enrollment date). We will use the prior claims data to characterize health care utilization and expenditures by: (1) different types of service (i.e., inpatient care, outpatient care, prescription drugs, etc); (2) acute versus chronic treatments; and (3) preventable versus non preventable. We will risk stratify the study sample using three RAMs (i.e., Chronic Disability and Payment System, The Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACG) System, and 3M Clinical Risk Groups (CRGs). We will compare predictions of next year's health care utilization and expenditures for each RAM using generalized linear models that include or exclude SDH variables. We will also quantify the incident and cumulative risk associated with different SDH factors on disease onset during a one year follow-up period using generalized estimating equation models.

"Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages PROJECT ABSTRACT Health insurance has been at the forefront of US public policy debate throughout the last decade. For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965. Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be a controversial definition. Some decisions about what Medicare should cover have engendered intense debate, underscoring the importance of the program’s coverage decisions for millions of patients and doctors. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. Yet, despite the importance of decisions about the scope of insurance coverage in and outside of Medicare, we know little about how the scope of coverage (as opposed to patient cost-sharing), affects treatment choices, clinical practice, and health outcomes for the elderly. The research outlined in this proposal aims to start filling this gap. The project investigates how the presence or lack of insurance coverage for specific procedural or pharmacologic therapies affects treatment decisions and health outcomes for the elderly with Alzheimer’s Disease and related Dementias (ADRD). This is a population that may be particularly vulnerable to changes and limits in insurance coverage, as the patients may have limited decision-making capacity and may be disproportionately exposed to treatments that are deemed experimental and lacking effectiveness to clear the “reasonable and necessary” threshold. Aim 1 of the project is to estimate the average effect of coverage decisions across prescription drugs and outpatient procedures on treatment decisions and health outcomes of elderly Medicare enrollees with ADRD. Aim 2 is to predict and characterize the subgroups of ADRD patients that are most likely to be affected by decisions that restrict the scope of insurance coverage using machine learning methods. The proposed empirical method is to use quasi- experimental variation that arises from natural experiments of abrupt changes in insurance coverage within different parts of the Medicare program. The analysis takes advantage of variation in the scope of formularies across Medicare Part D plans, as well as the variation in local coverage decisions for physician services and outpatient procedures under Medicare Part B. These sources of variation coupled with methods for quasi- experimental estimation of treatment effects and machine learning methods for heterogeneity analyses, allow estimating the response of treatment decisions and health of the elderly with ADRD across different drugs, procedures, and subgroups of ADRD patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965 - Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but nevertheless incomplete as by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be hard to define.

In this project I investigate how changes in coverage for prescription drugs, physician office visits, and outpatient procedures affect the treatment received by elderly patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD), who often face coverage limitations due to experimental nature of many ADRD treatments, and yet may be most vulnerable to unintended consequences of any coverage restrictions.",Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages,9928348,K01AG059843,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Amyloid ', ' Amyloid Substance ', ' Anxiety ', ' Barbiturates ', ' Benzodiazepines ', ' Benzodiazepine Compounds ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Formularies ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Heart ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Physicians ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' PET ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET imaging ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PETT ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Public Policy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Skilled Nursing Facilities ', ' Extended Care Facilities ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Medicare Part B ', ' Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance Program ', ' SMI Program ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Therapeutic procedure ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Universal Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' gastric banding ', ' gastric bypass surgery ', ' implantable gastric stimulation banding ', ' obesity surgery ', ' stomach stapling ', ' weight loss surgery ', ' bariatric surgery ', ' Family Physicians ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Coupled ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' treatment effect ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' alternative treatment ', ' patient population ', ' response to treatment ', ' therapeutic response ', ' treatment response ', ' clinical practice ', ' decision-making capacity ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' Learning Skill ', ' treatment choice ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' high dimensionality ', ' insurance claims ', ' public insurance ', ' public health insurance ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,126700,0.12444382502025936
"Reproductive care in the safety net: Women's health after Affordable Care Act implementation (EVERYWOMAN) PROJECT SUMMARY Evidence-based reproductive care decreases morbidity and mortality for women and their children, reduces disparities, and saves money; however, many women do not receive needed reproductive care. Cost and lack of health insurance are known barriers to receiving care, and women who are poor and representative of racial and/or ethnic minorities are least likely to receive needed reproductive care. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) prioritized reproductive health care as an essential component of women's clinical preventive services and called for every state to significantly expand Medicaid coverage by 2014. Little is yet known about how ACA Medicaid expansions are impacting the delivery of reproductive health care. The 2012 United States (US) Supreme Court ruling that made ACA Medicaid expansions optional for states created a natural experiment to answer this important question. As of January, 2016, 31 states and the District of Columbia had expanded Medicaid, while 19 states had not. We will use this unprecedented natural experiment to study the impact of the ACA and Medicaid expansion on the provision of women's reproductive health care in community health centers (CHCs). The proposed Reproductive care in the safety net: Women's health after Affordable Care Act implementation (EVERYWOMAN) project is a mixed-methods study that will leverage patient-level electronic health record (EHR) data from two CHC networks: the Community Health Applied Research Network (CHARN) and the ADVANCE clinical data research network (CDRN). Together, the CHARN and ADVANCE research data warehouses have patient-level data on over 3 million patients from CHCs across 26 states (14 expansion and 12 non-expansion states). These data will be augmented through qualitative data on patient and provider perceptions of the impact of the ACA on reproductive health care in low-income and vulnerable populations. The specific aims are as follows:  Aim 1: Describe provision of women's reproductive health care before and after implementation of the  ACA and between expansion and non-expansion states.  Aim 2: Identify individual, clinic, and state-level factors associated with provision of women's  reproductive health care.  Aim 3: Understand provider and patient perceptions of the provision and utilization of reproductive  health care in low-income and vulnerable populations. This project builds on our team's experience in insurance, primary care, women's health, and utilizing EHR clinical data for research. The ADVANCE and CHARN datasets position us uniquely to study national-level impacts of the ACA. Findings will be relevant to policy and practice, informing efforts to enhance the provision of timely, evidence-based reproductive care, improve health outcomes, and reduce disparities among low- income vulnerable populations of women. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite evidence demonstrating that evidence-based reproductive health care decreases morbidity and mortality for women and their children, reduces disparities, and saves money, many women do not receive needed reproductive health care services, and women who are poor and representative of racial and/or ethnic minorities are least likely to receive needed care. By expanding access to Medicaid and prioritizing women's preventive services, including reproductive health care, the Affordable Care Act has the potential to significantly enhance the provision of reproductive health care, especially in low-income and underserved populations served by community health centers. The proposed project is a mixed-methods study that will leverage patient-level electronic health record (EHR) data from two community health center networks [the Community Health Applied Research Network (CHARN) and the ADVANCE clinical data research network], augmented through qualitative data to explore if and how the ACA and Medicaid expansion have impacted the provision and utilization of reproductive health care services in community health center settings.",Reproductive care in the safety net: Women's health after Affordable Care Act implementation (EVERYWOMAN),9927999,R01HS025155,[''],AHRQ,"OCHIN, INC.",R01,2020,371344,0.09156959957566184
"Evaluating Control of Hypertension - Effect of Social Determinants (ECHOES) Project Summary Hypertension (HTN) is the most common chronic condition among adults in the United States (US). Uninsured adults are more likely to have undiagnosed HTN, less likely to receive regular screening, and less likely to have their HTN under control than insured adults. Prior studies of individual states' Medicaid expansion showed that gaining insurance increased healthcare service utilization, receipt of recommended preventive care, and improved health outcomes; but these studies were limited by having no comparison group. More recently, multiple states were impacted by federal policy changes (e.g., Affordable Care Act [ACA]), creating `natural experiments' to assess whether and how gaining (or losing) health insurance improves HTN prevention and care. Further, there is variability in how states choose to expand or contract coverage, which creates opportunities to identify `intervention' and `control' states (e.g., some states expanded Medicaid eligibility, while others did not). We are well-poised to study the ACA Medicaid expansion natural policy experiment and other policy changes that may unfold in the next few years. In addition, access to care through health insurance may be insufficient to reduce barriers to HTN care. Thus, other social determinants of health ([SDOH]; e.g., individual- and community-level factors) may differentially affect the relationship between gaining insurance and receiving HTN care. We will use electronic health record (EHR) data from the ADVANCE clinical data research network, linked to community-level SDOH, which has data from 599 community health centers (CHCs), including 376 CHCs in 14 Medicaid expansion states (n=1,139,779 patients) and 224 CHCs in 8 non- expansion states (n=658,306 patients). From this dataset, we will collect detailed information on changes in HTN incidence, screening, treatment, and management comparing states that expanded Medicaid, and those that did not. The specific aims are as follows: Aim 1. Compare HTN incidence, prevalence of undiagnosed HTN, and rates of HTN screening, in Medicaid expansion versus non-expansion states before and after the ACA. Aim 2. Compare HTN treatment and management in Medicaid expansion versus non-expansion states, before and after the ACA. Aim 3. Assess the extent to which rates of HTN incidence, screening, and treatment effectiveness among patients who gained insurance versus those continuously insured or uninsured, pre-post ACA, are moderated by individual-level SDOH (e.g., race, ethnicity). Aim 4. Explore the interaction between community-level SDOH (e.g., neighborhood racial segregation and deprivation) and HTN screening, treatment, and management among patients who gained insurance relative to those who were already insured or uninsured, in expansion states. We will build directly on our preliminary work and take advantage of the diverse strengths of our multidisciplinary team. The ADVANCE dataset uniquely positions us to assess current and future natural experiments. Findings will be relevant to policy and practice changes aimed at mitigating disparities in HTN care for vulnerable populations. Project Narrative Some states implemented Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansion while other states did not creating a natural experiment to study the impact of increased access to health insurance on hypertension incidence, screening, treatment, and management.

"Immigrant Families and Children's Health: The Intergenerational Health Impact of Federal and State Immigration Policy ABSTRACT One in four children in the United States lives in an immigrant family (i.e., with at least one immigrant parent in the household), and at least one in twenty lives in a mixed-immigration status family (i.e., variability in immigration status). While several studies have demonstrated the importance of a family’s immigration status as a social determinant of child health – few have analyzed the role of immigration policy (including national, state and local immigration policies) in shaping child health outcomes. Historically, such analyses have been challenging because of the limited availability of nationwide data sets containing the requisite measures of immigration status, and the use of insufficiently-rigorous analytic techniques that are unable to go beyond statistical associations. Our interdisciplinary group has shown its capacity to overcome these issues in a recent study using state Medicaid data and innovative analytic techniques to examine the impact of immigration policy on infant, child, and maternal health. For this proposal, our overarching goal is to extend this capacity nationwide by using Medicaid data to assess the impact of public policy on health care access, health-service utilization, and health outcomes for US-born children of first-generation immigrant parents. Specifically, we will fulfill the following aims. Aim 1: we will build a national, longitudinal, linked Medicaid data set to examine the effect of immigration policies on children’s health. Aim 2: using this national database, we will examine the impact of national immigration policy on child health (e.g., mental health) and health care use (e.g., primary-care access, hospital utilization). Aim 3: we will examine state and local immigration policies to determine the differential impact of various policies on immigrant parents and their US-born children. We use eligibility requirements for Medicaid to identify immigrant mothers and their US-born children, and then use probabilistic matching (via household billing identification systems and birth records) to link family units. To conduct the analyses in Aims 2-3, we will use causal inference research designs (such as difference-in-difference) to explore the impact of external public policy changes – taking advantage of “natural experiments” in policy implementation over time and across geographic areas. This includes federal and state immigration policies (e.g., immigration laws, regulations that include or exclude immigrants from particular services), state and local immigration actions (e.g., workplace-level and community-level enforcement), and federal and state health policies (e.g., federal Medicaid legislation, regulation or guidance specific to prenatal care, pediatric care) that may differentially impact first- generation immigrant parents and their US-born children. We hypothesize that these policies will have important intergenerational impacts on the health and wellbeing of US-born children of immigrants. Answering these specific aims is essential to inform decision-making by policymakers, public health leaders, and medical professionals who are committed to addressing health disparities and improving health trajectories for children in immigrant families, one of the most rapidly growing child population groups. PROJECT NARRATIVE Immigrant families confront an increasingly complex array of local, state, and federal health- and immigration- focused policies with important implications for access to health care as well as direct short- and long-term consequences for well-being. Although current research points to a strong relationship between immigration status, health access, and health outcomes, we have yet to develop systematic evidence on the policy levers that have the potential to impact such a large number of immigrants’ lives.

"Effects of Insurance Expansions on Cancer Treatment: Recent Policy Changes and Implications for Future Reform PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cancer is among the most common causes of death and most costly diseases in the US, and timely access to high quality treatment is essential for minimizing cancer morbidity and mortality. Insurance coverage is an important determinant of access to care that contributes to documented disparities in outcomes. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded access to insurance for non-elderly adults through subsidized Marketplace coverage and expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults in participating states. There is little evidence regarding the impact of insurance coverage expansions on access to or quality of cancer care. The proposed project will leverage variation in the timing of ACA provisions and changes in coverage under those provisions across geographic areas to estimate the impacts of insurance coverage expansions on cancer treatment. We use population-based data from Pennsylvania – the largest Medicaid expansion state that did not have extensive coverage for low-income adults prior to the ACA. Data come from the Pennsylvania state- wide cancer registry, along with data from all-payer inpatient, hospital outpatient, and ambulatory surgery center administrative files from the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council (PHC4), linked to the registry at the individual level. The sample includes all non-elderly adult cancer patients in the state, with discharge information across all payers, including for uninsured patients. We use a quasi-experimental approach to estimate the effects of both private (Marketplace) and public (Medicaid) expansions on access to and quality of care for patients diagnosed with the four most common cancers (breast, prostate, lung and colorectal). Specifically, we examine the impact of insurance expansions on insurance coverage for cancer patients (Aim 1), access to cancer treatment (Aim 2), and quality of cancer care (Aim 3). We hypothesize that increases in coverage will be associated with shorter time from diagnosis to treatment; higher likelihood of treatment in accredited cancer centers, academic centers, and high-volume hospitals; increased receipt of guideline concordant care; and reductions in hospital readmission. All analysis will be stratified by cancer type, allowing for assessment of differential impacts across cancers, and we will assess the role of insurance coverage in reducing disparities in access for racial/ethnic minorities and rural populations. The project will provide detailed evidence on how the ACA affected insurance coverage, access, and quality of care for cancer patients, including the impact on existing disparities in care for underserved racial/ethnic minority and rural patients. A detailed understanding of the impacts of health insurance coverage expansions on care for cancer (among the most costly and deadly diseases in the US) will inform federal and state policymakers debating health reform proposals, program officials seeking evidence to guide development and implementation of coverage and care delivery policies, and researchers assessing ongoing policy changes and interventions to reduce disparities in cancer care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer is among the most common causes of death and most costly diseases in the US, and lack of health insurance can limit access to high quality treatment.

"Impact of Medicaid Expansion on Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in ESRD Project Summary  The development of end stage renal disease (ESRD) carries devastating implications for patients, including increased morbidity and mortality, lost productivity, and impaired quality of life. The burden of this disease disproportionately falls on the country's most disadvantaged communities. In preliminary work for this grant, we found that 25% of patients aged 19-64 are uninsured at the time of initiating dialysis. This poses a barrier to receiving nephrology care prior to dialysis and initiating dialysis with an arteriovenous fistula rather than a high-risk temporary catheter. Failure to access these pre-dialysis services strongly predicts worse outcomes after dialysis including hospitalizations and death. Further, kidney failure due to diabetes and hypertension (the two most common causes of ESRD) can be prevented or delayed with appropriate blood pressure and glucose control. However, the uninsured have limited ability to finance health services and often forego effective preventive and chronic disease care. Taken together, these findings suggest that expanding health insurance coverage may be a powerful strategy to address disparities in the outcomes with and incidence of kidney failure. But there is limited research to confirm or refute this assertion. Filling this gap in knowledge is critical, since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides states with the option to expand Medicaid coverage to residents with income less than 138% of the Federal Poverty Level. Rigorous empirical evidence about the consequences of expansion, particularly for high-cost, high-need populations, may inform these decisions but are currently unavailable.  Using clinical data from all incident patients with ESRD in the United States from 2009-2018, our specific aims are: 1. Assess the effects of Medicaid expansion on pre-dialysis care for low-income incident populations; 2. Assess the impact of Medicaid expansion on post-dialysis outcomes; and 3. Evaluate early effects of Medicaid expansion on the incidence of ESRD. Our central hypotheses are that Medicaid expansion improved access to recommended pre-dialysis care; reduced hospitalizations and mortality following dialysis; and lowered the incidence of kidney failure, particularly among minority populations and those living in low- income neighborhoods. The proposal is innovative, as we leverage the variation in state Medicaid expansion decisions to test the causal effect of increased Medicaid coverage for a high-risk population. Further, by geocoding patient addresses we will track Census-Tract level outcomes, test alternative approaches for small area estimation, and assess geographic discontinuities across state borders. This project will provide rigorous evidence about the public health and health equity implications of a key feature of the ACA, perhaps the most consequential health care legislation since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. Project Narrative  This project will evaluate the impact of Medicaid expansion on access to effective pre-dialysis care, outcomes following the initiation of dialysis, and the incidence of end stage renal disease. This contribution is significant because reducing disparities in kidney disease is a critical public health priority, and Medicaid expansion may be an effective policy strategy to achieve that goal.",Impact of Medicaid Expansion on Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in ESRD,9849599,R01DK113298,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Arteriovenous fistula ', ' AV fistula ', ' Arteriovenous Aneurysm ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Censuses ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Expenditure ', ' Fistula ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Services ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Renal Grafting ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' kidney tx ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Legislation ', ' Medicaid ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nephrology ', ' Patients ', ' Peritoneal Dialysis ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Catheters ', ' falls ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Specialist ', ' Uninsured ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' court ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Failure ', ' Policies ', ' Native Americans ', ' Venous ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Source ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' social ', ' Consequentialism ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Clinical Data ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Health financing ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' federal poverty level ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' health equity ', ' public health priorities ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' ']",NIDDK,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,380041,0.09501572671856891
"Gender Disparities in Access and Engagement in Medication-Assisted Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  In response to PAR-18-747, Addressing the Challenges of the Opioid Epidemic in Minority Health and Health Disparities Research in the U.S. (R01), we propose longitudinal analyses of gender difference in entry, access, and engagement in medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD). Our study team includes leading experts in gender disparities (Drs. Marsh and Grella), MAT access (Drs. Guerrero and Hortensia Amaro) and advanced longitudinal approaches (Drs. Kong and Hedeker). We will draw from unique multiyear, program- and client-level data from before (2011-2013) and after (2015-2017) Medicaid expansion to detect disparities and examine the role of risks to women, program capacity, and comprehensive services in eliminating disparities overtime. In Aim 1, we will detect gender differences in trends in treatment entry (clients with OUD), access (wait time), and engagement (retention and dropout risk) in Los Angeles County from 2011- 2017. This will provide the first-known evidence of gender-based trends in treatment entry, access, and engagement in MAT in one the largest publicly funded treatment systems in the United States. In Aim 2, we will seek to understand differences between men and women and among women with OUDs by risk profiles and program factors across key outcomes of treatment access and engagement. This will provide the first-known evidence of differential pathways for women and men to access and engage in MAT programs. In Aim 3, we will examine the effect of Medicaid expansion on women with OUDs, controlling for client risk profiles and program capacity, across outcomes of treatment entry, access, and engagement. This work will document the impact of Medicaid expansion on women's MAT entry, access and engagement. Our findings will inform health care policies and practices and advance systems science and practice guidelines to enhance access to and engagement in care for women with OUD, one of the most vulnerable populations affected by the current opioid epidemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The opioid epidemic disproportionately affects women, racial and ethnic minorities, and other vulnerable groups. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT), e.g., methadone and buprenorphine plus counseling, is the recommended standard of care for all groups. Yet, little is known about strategies to improve MAT access and engagement, especially for women with opioid use disorders (OUD) who reside in low-income and urban settings. Our proposed program and client data analysis will provide scientific evidence to understand post- Medicaid pathways for increasing MAT access and engagement reducing gender disparities in OUD treatment.",Gender Disparities in Access and Engagement in Medication-Assisted Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder,9961559,R01DA048176,"['Affect ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Buprenorphine ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Client ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Heroin ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Dropout ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Family ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Leadership ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medicaid ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methadone ', ' Adanon ', ' Althose ', ' Dolophine ', ' Methadose ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Caring ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' diamorphine overdose ', ' heroin overdose ', ' Heroin Users ', ' treatment program ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Drops ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' trend ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' minority health ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' modifiable risk ', ' advanced system ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' standard of care ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' opiate use disorder ', ' opioid use disorder ', ' medication-assisted treatment ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid use ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' gender difference ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' gender disparity ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' urban setting ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' Wait Time ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2020,466317,0.029467410593285576
"Administrative Supplement to Policy Change and Women's Health PROJECT SUMMARY The central goal of our parent R01 project, Policy Change and Women's Health (HDR01095951), is to examine the impact of Medicaid expansion, particularly under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), on preconception health, reproductive health behavior (e.g., contraception, unintended pregnancy, and fertility), and pregnancy health and outcomes. With this Supplement request, we propose to extend our inquiry to address the impact of Medicaid expansion on pregnancy-associated mortality and its determinants in the postpartum period. Prior to the ACA Medicaid expansions, many low-income women who qualified for Medicaid during pregnancy lacked health insurance coverage prior to conception and subsequently lost coverage 60 days after delivery. This discontinuity of insurance across the perinatal period may be a key determinant in pregnancy-associated mortality. The expansion of Medicaid to low income women regardless of pregnancy status offers an opportunity to examine whether increasing continuity of insurance prior to and after pregnancy improves postpartum health care utilization, mental health, and rates of pregnancy-associated mortality. Thus, we will extend Aim 1 of our Parent R01, which assesses the impact of Medicaid expansion on preconception health care utilization, health behavior, and health using Pregnancy Risk Monitoring System (PRAMS) 2012-2017 data to also assess postpartum continuity of insurance, health care utilization, and mental health. We will extend Aim 3 of our Parent R01, which examines the impact of Medicaid expansion on pregnancy health and outcomes using vital statistics data, to assess overall and cause-specific pregnancy-related mortality. Moreover, we will examine racial/ethnic inequities in the impact of Medicaid expansion on both determinants of and rates in pregnancy-associated mortality. Achieving these aims will expand research on one of the potential leading causes of pregnancy-associated mortality in the U.S.: discontinuous insurance during the perinatal period, particularly the cessation of Medicaid eligibility after 60 days postpartum. We will also identify how policy-level determinants impact racial/ethnic disparities in risk factors for and rates of pregnancy-associated mortality in the U.S. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will advance public health and policy knowledge about the impacts of Medicaid expansion on determinants and rates of, and disparities in, pregnancy-associated mortality. Our findings will provide policy- relevant information about whether extending Medicaid coverage across the perinatal period improves measures of postpartum health and reduces pregnancy-associated mortality.",Administrative Supplement to Policy Change and Women's Health,10194963,R01HD095951,"['Conceptions ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Death Records ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fertility ', ' Fecundability ', ' Fecundity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Homicide ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Overdose ', ' Parents ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Rate ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Testing ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Postpartum ', ' post-partum ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Caring ', ' Peripartum ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Domestic Violence ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policies ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Native Americans ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Contraception ', ' Fertility Control ', ' Inhibition of Fertilization ', ' Contraceptive methods ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Indigenous ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Monitor ', ' Unplanned pregnancy ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' Outcome ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' screening ', ' violence victimization ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' post-partum care ', ' postpartum care ', ' Medicaid eligibility ', ' perinatal phase ', ' perinatal period ', ' post-partum health ', ' postpartum health ', ' pregnancy associated mortality ', ' pregnancy associated death ', ' ']",NICHD,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,225035,0.16523341435673133
