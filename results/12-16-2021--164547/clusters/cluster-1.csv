"RETIREMENT FROM A LIFE-COURSE PERSPECTIVE DESCRIPTION:  (Investigator's Abstract) Conceptualizing retirement as a dynamic, age-dependent process, we propose to investigate the impact of mid-and late-career events on retirement, disability and death.  Particular attention will be devoted to the influence of the timing, direction, and magnitude of earlier career events on the relative frequency of those transitions that generally mark the end of the labor force career.  This focus allows us to empirically evaluate the bonds between major career events and speaks directly to a theoretical concern with career-line vulnerability to aging and the ramifications for the retirement process of career deterioration or advancement.  To better understand career-line vulnerability to aging, itself, the analysis of the retirement process will be preceded by an inquiry of the determinants of career mobility.  We will attend explicitly to those factors that influence the timing, direction, and magnitude of occupational mobility.  Timing refers to the age at which mobility occurs, and the direction and magnitude of mobility refer of changes in the attractiveness of work, both positive and negative, associated with occupational changes.  The consideration of all three factors is especially important to achieve an accurate portrayal of the age-vulnerability of older men's careers.  The analysis is a cohort-based prospective study based on the National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men. This is a nationally representative sample of men aged 45-59 years in 1966 who are followed for a 17-year period.  The proposed study is unique in that it will more fully exploit the longitudinal qualities of the data than prior studies.  Specifically, based on a subsample of men who are in the labor force at some point during the observation period, biographical histories of labor force behavior and time-dependent explanatory covariates will be developed, and a hazards model approach will be used to formally model the dynamic processes of career mobility and retirement.  Although prior studies have recognized the over-arching importance of considering the consequences of mobility patterns for the retirement process, this study is the first to explicitly attend to these issues.  Such as approach promises to provide new insights into the role of the career dynamics for late-life labor force behavior, and it will serve to integrate the retirement process with the larger career cycle.  Finally, the results of this study will be pertinent to critical policy concerns of inequities of access to retirement, pension policy, the retraining of older workers, and pre-retirement planning.

"Contraceptive Use Patterns Among Teens and Young Adults The specific aim of the proposed project is to enhance our understanding of how to sustain recent improvements in contraceptive use at first sex so that teens and young adults can become more consistent contraceptive users.  The proposed project will examine patterns of contraceptive use and consistency across sexual relationships, within current cohorts of teens and young adults.  Our premise is that contraceptive use must be negotiated and sustained within each new sexual relationship.  Understanding why teens and young adults use contraception consistently, as well as understanding patterns of inconsistent use, will help inform strategies to prevent unintended pregnancy and STIs. Analyses by race/ethnicity will help address disparities in reproductive health among racial and ethnic minorities. Additional sub-population analyses will include comparisons of teens and young adults, and males and females. The proposed project will incorporate an ecological framework, which posits that behaviors among teens and young adults will be influenced by factors from multiple domains of their lives.  We will incorporate multi-level and multi-process models to examine how contraceptive use patterns are shaped by individual knowledge and motivations, characteristics of each sexual relationship (including partner characteristics and sexual activity), peer environments and family background, including parent-child communication.  We will also examine the influence of school, community, and policy variables, such as sex education programs and the presence of economic opportunities. The project will analyze month-by-month histories of contraceptive use and sexual relationships within two cycles of the National Survey of Family Growth (1995, 2001) and information on sexual relationships and contraceptive use patterns within three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.

"Social Context and HIV Risk among Mexican Gay Immigrants  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed ethnographic study seeks to investigate the nature of changes in the lives of Mexican gay and bisexual male immigrants that result in increased HIV risk. This study builds on previous quantitative research with Latino gay and bisexual men that paradoxically found that recent immigrants have much lower levels of HIV risk than their U.S-born counterparts, and that their risk increases with their length of residence in the US. The proposed study's specific aims are: (1) To describe the processes of incorporation into US gay life among Mexican gay and bisexual male immigrants and how their participation in social and sexual contexts in the United States affects their sexual health and HIV risk; (2) to compare the Mexican gay and bisexual immigrants' lived experiences regarding sexuality and HIV risk with those of their US-born counterparts; (3) to advance our theoretical knowledge about the emergence of health risks out of the intersection of migration, sexual orientation, participation in US social settings, and social inequality; and (4) to generate and disseminate data that HIV educators can directly use to design and improve HIV prevention programs for gay and bisexual Mexican immigrants. The study will consist of individual qualitative interviews with 150 men (2.5 hours per interview on average), follow-up interviews twelve months after the initial interview (1.25 hours per interview on average), and twenty-seven months of participant observation in social settings (Latino and non-Latino, gay and heterosexual) where gay and bisexual Mexican immigrants participate (4,360 hours of participant observation projected). These research activities will be conducted in San Diego, California. The collected textual data (field notes and interview transcripts) will be systematically coded for analysis. In broadest terms, the proposed research rejects monolithic conceptions of ethnic communities and contributes to the larger effort to study cultural diversity within ethnic minority communities in the US and the influence of such internal diversity on health. In this particular study, we focus on migration that is motivated by a homosexual orientation and seek to elucidate how it influences intra-group diversity in Latino communities in terms of sexuality and sexual identities, sexual behavior, participation and incorporation in US social settings, and sexual health.

"GENDER AND HIV CONSEQUENCES: HEALTH CARE AND RISK  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although the Centers for Disease Control and Institute of Medicine's recently proposed public health prevention strategies are based on linking prevention to treatment of the HIV infected population, little is know about the relationships between health care utilization and sexual risk behavior. Women represent an increasing proportion of people living with HIV in the U.S. It is important to understand how social and health system factors contribute to gender disparities in treatment and outcomes and whether and how such disparities affect HIV+ men's and women's sexual risk behavior. Women are more likely than men who have sex with men to decide to be abstinent, a choice which eliminates the risk of sexual transmission of HIV. However, women are also more likely than men who do not have sex with men to have unprotected sex. The proposed study will examine (1) whether differences in resources, barriers to care, relationship violence, and knowledge about HIV risk help to explain differences between the health care utilization of HIV-infected men and women, and (2) whether differences in medical treatment and other social services, resources, barriers to care, relationship violence, and knowledge about HIV risk help to explain differences between the risk behavior of HIV-infected men and women. The proposed study will link follow-up data from a study of HIV risk behavior with core data from the 3 waves of HCSUS interviews. These linked data give us a unique opportunity to explore how HIV+ women and men differ in health care utilization, and to examine whether this is related to their risk behavior. Results from the proposed study will contribute to efforts to reduce the spread of HIV.

"Race-Specific Occupational Risk Factors for Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Black men have overall age-adjusted rates of cancer incidence and mortality that are higher than any other U.S. population group. Findings from the 1996 Report on the National Occupational Research Agenda suggest that unidentified race-specific occupational risk factors for cancer may be important contributors to this disparity. An excess of occupational cancers among minorities is further underscored by a review revealing elevated non-white to white cancer mortality ratios in the majority of studies reporting any race-specific increases, with the greatest racial disparity evident for hematolymphopoietic cancers. Data are sparse, however, on race-specific etiologic determinants. Moreover, published reports have generally been based on data from death certificates and other secondary sources that are of questionable validity because of racial disparities in accuracy.      To address this information gap, the proposed project will use secondary data from the Selected Cancers Study (SCS) to investigate race-specific occupational risk factors for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin disease (HD), and soft tissue sarcoma (STS). The SCS was a large U.S. population-based case-control study conducted in the mid-1980s to examine associations between exposure of military troops to the defoliant herbicide Agent Orange during the Vietnam War and subsequent risk of these cancers. The study population comprised nearly 6,000 men aged 30 to 60 years, the majority of whom were directly interviewed. Study participants were asked about every full- and part-time job held for greater than or equal to 1 year since age 18. For each job, participants were queried about job title, main duties, type of business or industry, year job was started, and year job was ended; all responses were coded verbatim.      In an analysis using dichotomous occupational exposure data from the SCS, we identified striking increases in risk of NHL, HD, and STS among Black men exposed to chromium or wood dust, whereas no risk factors were found for Whites. One aim of this project will be to extend the preliminary analysis to investigate dose-response relations. A second aim will be an extension of that analysis to investigate risk factors among Hispanic men. A third project aim will be to examine race-specific dose-response associations for cancer risks in relation to occupational chlorophenol exposures and agricultural vs. non-agricultural herbicide exposures. A fourth aim will be to explore race- and cancer-specific risk factors based on Standard Occupational Codes and Standard Industry Codes. Because the SCS database includes detailed occupational information for a study population large enough to provide substantial power to detect race-specific occupational cancer risk factors, it provides a unique and cost-effective opportunity to identify preventable risk factors that may be contributing to racial disparities in cancer incidence and mortality.

"Economic Opportunity for Zimbabwean Adolescent Orphans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this project is to determine, using a randomized controlled design, whether an innovative economic and life-skills intervention designed to increase control over sexual interactions prevents the adverse consequences of unprotected sex among out-of-school female orphans aged 16-19 in Zimbabwe. The intervention, which builds on our recently completed study that assessed the feasibility of such a program, will be evaluated for its effect on the acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, as well as unintended pregnancy. The intervention consists of an integrated micro-credit program, including entrepreneurial training, loan provision, practical business education, mentorship, and peer support groups. This will be combined with a previously-tested fife-skills education curriculum that delivers HIV/reproductive health education through the use of role plays, drawing exercises, and other techniques, to help participants negotiate the terms of their sexual relationships. In order to assess the effects of this combined intervention over and above life-skills alone, the control group will receive the fife-skills education curriculum, a ""placebo"" health and nutrition training, and on-going peer support groups. Although there is great potential for such combined economic and life-skills programs to improve the reproductive health of female adolescent orphans, no research to date has assessed the effect of such interventions on sexual risk behaviors, STI/HIV or pregnancy outcomes in this or any other at-risk group. Our intervention is guided by a causal model in which the provision of economic alternatives and opportunities (through the micro-credit intervention) and sexual negotiation skills (through the life-skills intervention) are the driving forces in increasing control over sexual interactions, and thus reducing high-risk behaviors and adverse biological outcomes. The specific aims of this project are: 1) To assess the effectiveness of a combined micro-credit and life-skills education intervention in reducing the incidence of our primary outcomes: Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2) and unintended pregnancy; 2) To assess the effectiveness of a combined micro-credit and life-skills education intervention in reducing our secondary outcomes: high-risk risk behaviors (e.g., unprotected sex, number of partners, transactional sex, early sexual debut, sexual coercion and violence); 3) To examine the intermediary effects of increased economic opportunity and improved sexual negotiation skills in enhancing participants' control over sexual interactions, and 4) To evaluate whether characteristics related to participation, i.e., factors related to participant adherence, satisfaction, and understanding of the intervention mediate observed effects.

"Woman Focused HIV Prevention with African-Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised competing continuation proposes to examine the long-term effects of the Women's CoOp intervention funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). HIV surveillance indicates that underclass African-Americans in the South continue to be at high risk for HIV and face significant health disparities through poverty, unemployment, and homelessness. Intervention research has demonstrated that HIV is preventable through safer drug and sexual practices, and that HIV risk behaviors can and do change. However, African-American women who live in poverty experience unique social contexts that affect HIV risk. These contexts need to be addressed in sustaining HIV risk reduction. The Women's CoOp study has demonstrated that a gender-based, individualized HIV prevention intervention with inner-city African-American women who use crack cocaine is effective in reducing HIV risk behaviors and empowering these women to begin to change their social contexts of employment and homelessness. These findings suggest that the women who were able to positively change their social contexts by becoming employed or finding homes had greater reductions in sexual risk for HIV than those who remained unemployed or homeless. However, it is not known if these risk-reduction behaviors can be sustained over time. Many African-American women who live in high-risk communities face environmental stressors that may facilitate relapse to drug and sexual risk behaviors. The next empirical question for the Women's CoOp study is to determine the long-term effects of the Woman-Focused intervention with regard to drug and sexual risk for HIV, self-sufficiency, and a woman's ability to sustain change within her social context. Further, we posit that briefer interventions at regular intervals will be more effective in sustaining behavior change and be more cost-effective. The specific aims of the proposed study are as follows: Aim 1. To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a culturally specific, woman-focused intervention relative to the NIDA standard intervention in terms of crack use and sexual risk behaviors and self-sufficiency (e.g., employment, housing). Aim 2. To compare the effectiveness of a culturally specific, woman-focused booster follow-up intervention--relative to the NIDA standard booster follow-up intervention offered biannually--to sustain reductions in crack use and sexual risk and improve self-sufficiency at 6, 12, and 18 months post reenrollment among Women's CoOp participants. Aim 3. To examine the mediating effects of employment and housing, as well as moderators, such as age, abuse history and psychological distress, on the effectiveness of the intervention at changing HIV risk behaviors at 6, 12, and 18 months post reenrollment. Aim 4. To estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of a culturally specific, woman-focused intervention relative to the NIDA standard in terms of crack use and sexual risk behaviors.

"Love, Marriage, and HIV: Gender and HIV Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Objective: For women in many parts of the world, the behavior that puts them at greatest risk for HIV infection is unprotected sex within marriage. The proposed comparative ethnographic study will explore how social and cultural factors influence marital and extramarital intimate relationships and examine the sexual and the HIV prevention practices of men and women engaged in building these relationships across five locations in countries at different stages of the HIV epidemic. By detailing the processes through which contextual factors shape women's risk of marital HIV infection, this study will contribute to our understanding of ways to reduce the risk of heterosexual HIV transmission.  Background and Significance: The study is guided by three premises:  that the role of married men in sustaining heterosexual transmission of HIV has been insufficiently explored; that spreading ideologies of monogamous companionate marriage may put married women at particular risk, and that culturally specific knowledge about the social, economic, and emotional context of sexual relationships can provide important insight into the avenues through which gender inequality combines with economic organization and emerging ideologies of marital love to put women at  risk for marital HIV transmission.  Methods: Five developing country sites representing different stages of the HIV epidemic have been selected for study: Degollado, Jalisco Tari, Papua New Guinea, Soc Son, Vietnam, Ubakala, Nigeria, and Bulubandi, Uganda. In each site, researchers will use ethnographic methods to examine the social and cultural determinants of the risk of marital transmission of HIV. We anticipate totals of 200 semi-structured ethnographic interviews with a systematic ethnographic sample of men and women (40 per site) and 100 marital case histories (20 per site), to be collected over 6 months of participant observation.

"Love, Marriage, and HIV: Gender and HIV Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Objective: For women in many parts of the world, the behavior that puts them at greatest risk for HIV infection is unprotected sex within marriage. The proposed comparative ethnographic study will explore how social and cultural factors influence marital and extramarital intimate relationships and examine the sexual and the HIV prevention practices of men and women engaged in building these relationships across five locations in countries at different stages of the HIV epidemic. By detailing the processes through which contextual factors shape women's risk of marital HIV infection, this study will contribute to our understanding of ways to reduce the risk of heterosexual HIV transmission.  Background and Significance: The study is guided by three premises:  that the role of married men in sustaining heterosexual transmission of HIV has been insufficiently explored; that spreading ideologies of monogamous companionate marriage may put married women at particular risk, and that culturally specific knowledge about the social, economic, and emotional context of sexual relationships can provide important insight into the avenues through which gender inequality combines with economic organization and emerging ideologies of marital love to put women at  risk for marital HIV transmission.  Methods: Five developing country sites representing different stages of the HIV epidemic have been selected for study: Degollado, Jalisco Tari, Papua New Guinea, Soc Son, Vietnam, Ubakala, Nigeria, and Bulubandi, Uganda. In each site, researchers will use ethnographic methods to examine the social and cultural determinants of the risk of marital transmission of HIV. We anticipate totals of 200 semi-structured ethnographic interviews with a systematic ethnographic sample of men and women (40 per site) and 100 marital case histories (20 per site), to be collected over 6 months of participant observation. For each field site, ethnographic data will be analyzed using a multilevel hierarchical coding process to relate specific attitudes and behaviors to relationship- and macro-level factors. The ethnographic findings will be pooled to conduct an analysis of key themes and findings across sites.  Implications: The assumption that marriage equals monogamy may be costing women their lives.

"Woman Focused HIV Prevention with African-Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised competing continuation proposes to examine the long-term effects of the Women's CoOp intervention funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). HIV surveillance indicates that underclass African-Americans in the South continue to be at high risk for HIV and face significant health disparities through poverty, unemployment, and homelessness. Intervention research has demonstrated that HIV is preventable through safer drug and sexual practices, and that HIV risk behaviors can and do change. However, African-American women who live in poverty experience unique social contexts that affect HIV risk. These contexts need to be addressed in sustaining HIV risk reduction. The Women's CoOp study has demonstrated that a gender-based, individualized HIV prevention intervention with inner-city African-American women who use crack cocaine is effective in reducing HIV risk behaviors and empowering these women to begin to change their social contexts of employment and homelessness. These findings suggest that the women who were able to positively change their social contexts by becoming employed or finding homes had greater reductions in sexual risk for HIV than those who remained unemployed or homeless. However, it is not known if these risk-reduction behaviors can be sustained over time. Many African-American women who live in high-risk communities face environmental stressors that may facilitate relapse to drug and sexual risk behaviors. The next empirical question for the Women's CoOp study is to determine the long-term effects of the Woman-Focused intervention with regard to drug and sexual risk for HIV, self-sufficiency, and a woman's ability to sustain change within her social context. Further, we posit that briefer interventions at regular intervals will be more effective in sustaining behavior change and be more cost-effective. The specific aims of the proposed study are as follows: Aim 1. To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a culturally specific, woman-focused intervention relative to the NIDA standard intervention in terms of crack use and sexual risk behaviors and self-sufficiency (e.g., employment, housing). Aim 2. To compare the effectiveness of a culturally specific, woman-focused booster follow-up intervention--relative to the NIDA standard booster follow-up intervention offered biannually--to sustain reductions in crack use and sexual risk and improve self-sufficiency at 6, 12, and 18 months post reenrollment among Women's CoOp participants. Aim 3. To examine the mediating effects of employment and housing, as well as moderators, such as age, abuse history and psychological distress, on the effectiveness of the intervention at changing HIV risk behaviors at 6, 12, and 18 months post reenrollment. Aim 4. To estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of a culturally specific, woman-focused intervention relative to the NIDA standard in terms of crack use and sexual risk behaviors.

"Contraceptive Use Patterns Among Teens and Young Adults The specific aim of the proposed project is to enhance our understanding of how to sustain recent improvements in contraceptive use at first sex so that teens and young adults can become more consistent contraceptive users.  The proposed project will examine patterns of contraceptive use and consistency across sexual relationships, within current cohorts of teens and young adults.  Our premise is that contraceptive use must be negotiated and sustained within each new sexual relationship.  Understanding why teens and young adults use contraception consistently, as well as understanding patterns of inconsistent use, will help inform strategies to prevent unintended pregnancy and STIs. Analyses by race/ethnicity will help address disparities in reproductive health among racial and ethnic minorities. Additional sub-population analyses will include comparisons of teens and young adults, and males and females. The proposed project will incorporate an ecological framework, which posits that behaviors among teens and young adults will be influenced by factors from multiple domains of their lives.  We will incorporate multi-level and multi-process models to examine how contraceptive use patterns are shaped by individual knowledge and motivations, characteristics of each sexual relationship (including partner characteristics and sexual activity), peer environments and family background, including parent-child communication.  We will also examine the influence of school, community, and policy variables, such as sex education programs and the presence of economic opportunities. The project will analyze month-by-month histories of contraceptive use and sexual relationships within two cycles of the National Survey of Family Growth (1995, 2001) and information on sexual relationships and contraceptive use patterns within three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.

"Social Context and HIV Risk among Mexican Gay Immigrants  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed ethnographic study seeks to investigate the nature of changes in the lives of Mexican gay and bisexual male immigrants that result in increased HIV risk. This study builds on previous quantitative research with Latino gay and bisexual men that paradoxically found that recent immigrants have much lower levels of HIV risk than their U.S-born counterparts, and that their risk increases with their length of residence in the US. The proposed study's specific aims are: (1) To describe the processes of incorporation into US gay life among Mexican gay and bisexual male immigrants and how their participation in social and sexual contexts in the United States affects their sexual health and HIV risk; (2) to compare the Mexican gay and bisexual immigrants' lived experiences regarding sexuality and HIV risk with those of their US-born counterparts; (3) to advance our theoretical knowledge about the emergence of health risks out of the intersection of migration, sexual orientation, participation in US social settings, and social inequality; and (4) to generate and disseminate data that HIV educators can directly use to design and improve HIV prevention programs for gay and bisexual Mexican immigrants. The study will consist of individual qualitative interviews with 150 men (2.5 hours per interview on average), follow-up interviews twelve months after the initial interview (1.25 hours per interview on average), and twenty-seven months of participant observation in social settings (Latino and non-Latino, gay and heterosexual) where gay and bisexual Mexican immigrants participate (4,360 hours of participant observation projected). These research activities will be conducted in San Diego, California. The collected textual data (field notes and interview transcripts) will be systematically coded for analysis. In broadest terms, the proposed research rejects monolithic conceptions of ethnic communities and contributes to the larger effort to study cultural diversity within ethnic minority communities in the US and the influence of such internal diversity on health. In this particular study, we focus on migration that is motivated by a homosexual orientation and seek to elucidate how it influences intra-group diversity in Latino communities in terms of sexuality and sexual identities, sexual behavior, participation and incorporation in US social settings, and sexual health.

"Economic Opportunity for Zimbabwean Adolescent Orphans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this project is to determine, using a randomized controlled design, whether an innovative economic and life-skills intervention designed to increase control over sexual interactions prevents the adverse consequences of unprotected sex among out-of-school female orphans aged 16-19 in Zimbabwe. The intervention, which builds on our recently completed study that assessed the feasibility of such a program, will be evaluated for its effect on the acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, as well as unintended pregnancy. The intervention consists of an integrated micro-credit program, including entrepreneurial training, loan provision, practical business education, mentorship, and peer support groups. This will be combined with a previously-tested fife-skills education curriculum that delivers HIV/reproductive health education through the use of role plays, drawing exercises, and other techniques, to help participants negotiate the terms of their sexual relationships. In order to assess the effects of this combined intervention over and above life-skills alone, the control group will receive the fife-skills education curriculum, a ""placebo"" health and nutrition training, and on-going peer support groups. Although there is great potential for such combined economic and life-skills programs to improve the reproductive health of female adolescent orphans, no research to date has assessed the effect of such interventions on sexual risk behaviors, STI/HIV or pregnancy outcomes in this or any other at-risk group. Our intervention is guided by a causal model in which the provision of economic alternatives and opportunities (through the micro-credit intervention) and sexual negotiation skills (through the life-skills intervention) are the driving forces in increasing control over sexual interactions, and thus reducing high-risk behaviors and adverse biological outcomes. The specific aims of this project are: 1) To assess the effectiveness of a combined micro-credit and life-skills education intervention in reducing the incidence of our primary outcomes: Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2) and unintended pregnancy; 2) To assess the effectiveness of a combined micro-credit and life-skills education intervention in reducing our secondary outcomes: high-risk risk behaviors (e.g., unprotected sex, number of partners, transactional sex, early sexual debut, sexual coercion and violence); 3) To examine the intermediary effects of increased economic opportunity and improved sexual negotiation skills in enhancing participants' control over sexual interactions, and 4) To evaluate whether characteristics related to participation, i.e., factors related to participant adherence, satisfaction, and understanding of the intervention mediate observed effects.

"Disposition Decisions by Couples with Frozen Embryos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this qualitative research is to better understand how infertile couples who have undergone in vitro fertilization decide what to do with their surplus frozen embryos. Because this question is complicated by the variety and disparity of the embryo's potential uses and dispositions, e.g., they can be used by the couple in further attempts to conceive, ""donated"" to other infertile couples who wish to have a child, used in stem cell research, or stored indefinitely, discarded, or destroyed, the limited available data suggests that couples address this decision with considerable uncertainty and ambivalence. This 48-month ethnographic study would be the first in-depth examination of how couples think about their frozen embryos and formulate their disposition decision. The research will study 100 couples longitudinally over a one-year period, using  three in-depth interviews of husbands and wives separately and together at six-month intervals, inducting participants who have frozen embryos in storage for between one and ten years. Qualitative data analysis will then proceed in a seven-step progression. The specific aims of this research are: (1) to examine the meanings that women and men attach to embryos; (2) to understand how women and men think about embryos in relation to concepts of the family; (3) to explore differences and similarities in how women and men conceptualize embryos; and (4) to describe the process women and men engage in as they consider the disposition of their frozen embryos, and whether their views of what should be done change over time. An exploration of the frozen embryo disposition decision would not only deepen our understanding of changing cultural notions about the meaning of family, but would inform several specific areas of public health policy that are currently mired in ambiguity, uncertainty, and controversy, e.g., the responsibilities and obligations of IVF clinics, the use of frozen embryos for stem cell research, and the ""donation"" or ""adoption"" of frozen embryos.

"Race-Specific Occupational Risk Factors for Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Black men have overall age-adjusted rates of cancer incidence and mortality that are higher than any other U.S. population group. Findings from the 1996 Report on the National Occupational Research Agenda suggest that unidentified race-specific occupational risk factors for cancer may be important contributors to this disparity. An excess of occupational cancers among minorities is further underscored by a review revealing elevated non-white to white cancer mortality ratios in the majority of studies reporting any race-specific increases, with the greatest racial disparity evident for hematolymphopoietic cancers. Data are sparse, however, on race-specific etiologic determinants. Moreover, published reports have generally been based on data from death certificates and other secondary sources that are of questionable validity because of racial disparities in accuracy.      To address this information gap, the proposed project will use secondary data from the Selected Cancers Study (SCS) to investigate race-specific occupational risk factors for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin disease (HD), and soft tissue sarcoma (STS). The SCS was a large U.S. population-based case-control study conducted in the mid-1980s to examine associations between exposure of military troops to the defoliant herbicide Agent Orange during the Vietnam War and subsequent risk of these cancers. The study population comprised nearly 6,000 men aged 30 to 60 years, the majority of whom were directly interviewed. Study participants were asked about every full- and part-time job held for greater than or equal to 1 year since age 18. For each job, participants were queried about job title, main duties, type of business or industry, year job was started, and year job was ended; all responses were coded verbatim.      In an analysis using dichotomous occupational exposure data from the SCS, we identified striking increases in risk of NHL, HD, and STS among Black men exposed to chromium or wood dust, whereas no risk factors were found for Whites. One aim of this project will be to extend the preliminary analysis to investigate dose-response relations. A second aim will be an extension of that analysis to investigate risk factors among Hispanic men. A third project aim will be to examine race-specific dose-response associations for cancer risks in relation to occupational chlorophenol exposures and agricultural vs. non-agricultural herbicide exposures. A fourth aim will be to explore race- and cancer-specific risk factors based on Standard Occupational Codes and Standard Industry Codes. Because the SCS database includes detailed occupational information for a study population large enough to provide substantial power to detect race-specific occupational cancer risk factors, it provides a unique and cost-effective opportunity to identify preventable risk factors that may be contributing to racial disparities in cancer incidence and mortality.

"HIV Risk & Migration -Young Yi Minority - Sichuan China DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Southeast and central Asia are witnessing rapid penetration by the global market economy. The urbanization that has paralleled this economic transformation has brought with it an increased spread of communicable diseases, often in areas with limited public health resources. Expansions in migrants' involvement in the urban-based informal labor sector is of particular concern because movement between urban centers and remote rural regions may serve as a mechanism for diffusing both behavioral risk practices as well as infectious diseases themselves. With a long history of social and economic marginalization, and increasing dependence on urban-based migrant labor, the Yi minorities are an especially vulnerable ethnic group in southern China. This socio-economic vulnerability may be exacerbated by the general lack of knowledge about transmission of HIV and STD's in the region. Developed as an exploratory pilot study using the R21 mechanism, this application proposes a targeted set of ethnographic methods with which to elaborate our understanding of how and why migrant labor may confer unique health risks, notably high risk for exposure to drug and sexual risk practices. We propose to focus on young adult Yi because our preliminary work suggests that many Yi become involved in migrant labor early in their adult lives and that exposure to drug and sexual risk also occur early. Since our pilot work suggests that gender is an important influence on the economic roles that men and women occupy in migrant labor, we propose to study both men and women. Based on an established ethnographic research design, the study will begin with a set of formative research activities that will serve to orient the research team in the local communities where the study will be conducted. Additionally, a small group of key participants will be recruited for a series of ethnographic interviews that will include questions about life history and life course events, family experience, education and skills acquisition, subsistence and income generating strategies, knowledge and beliefs about HIV/STD's, initiation of drug and sexual risk activities, and experiences of stigma (N=60). Interviews will yield information that will allow us to construct a preliminary epidemiological trajectory of how drug and sexual risk practices are initiated, and key features of the early course of behavioral risk, that would need to be anticipated in future research and prevention activities.

"Changing Women's HIV Risk: Videos on Hand Held Computers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this small research grant proposal is to create and pilot test an intervention that will promote behavioral change in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sexual risk behavior in young, adult, urban women. A sequence of digital video vignettes be created and their use on a handheld computer will be pilot tested. The video vignettes will be based on content analysis of focus groups with young, adult women and men from public housing developments concerning their perspectives on dyadic trust, sexual pressure, and sexual risk behavior. The theoretical framework will be based on Barrett's (1998) theory of power as knowing participation in change. The vignettes will illustrate the importance of discovering whether and how women are making choices without being aware and without actualizing their potential. A documentary filmmaker, in consultation with research assistants who are representative of the target sample, the principal investigator, and a digital applications developer, will develop storyboards and produce the 20, one-minute video vignettes that are enacted by young adult women and men. The video vignettes will be evaluated for attitudinal change and acceptability in a pilot study at an urban public STD clinic. Use of the hand held computer with its small screen and use of a headset, promote privacy during data collection. The pilot study will use a pretest-posttest design. The development and evaluation of this approach are preliminary to a RO1 research proposal to study the effectiveness of a computerized decision support intervention that will rely on automated rules to deliver tailored, video health promotion messages as feedback to HIV risk behavior. This project addresses a gap in the literature concerning acceptability and feasibility of videos on a hand held computer as an approach to HIV risk reduction. It also addresses the following NINR research themes: Changing lifestyle behaviors for better health, identification of effective strategies to reduce health disparities, and harnessing advanced technologies to serve human needs.

Based on hypotheses that emerge from this study, the long-term goal is to develop culturally sensitive nursing interventions that incorporate the role of spirituality in improving self-management and ultimately health outcomes for African Americans with diabetes.         ",Spirituality in African Americans with Diabetes,6835425,F31NR008313,"['human middle age (35-64) ', ' noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus ', ' health care service utilization ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' questionnaire ', ' nursing model ', ' nurse patient relations ', ' nursing care evaluation ', ' health behavior ', ' attitude ', ' gender difference ', ' African American ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' religion ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' predoctoral investigator ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NINR,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2004,27518,0.01742949096953745
"Changing Women's HIV Risk: Videos on Hand Held Computers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this small research grant proposal is to create and pilot test an intervention that will promote behavioral change in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sexual risk behavior in young, adult, urban women. A sequence of digital video vignettes be created and their use on a handheld computer will be pilot tested. The video vignettes will be based on content analysis of focus groups with young, adult women and men from public housing developments concerning their perspectives on dyadic trust, sexual pressure, and sexual risk behavior. The theoretical framework will be based on Barrett's (1998) theory of power as knowing participation in change. The vignettes will illustrate the importance of discovering whether and how women are making choices without being aware and without actualizing their potential. A documentary filmmaker, in consultation with research assistants who are representative of the target sample, the principal investigator, and a digital applications developer, will develop storyboards and produce the 20, one-minute video vignettes that are enacted by young adult women and men. The video vignettes will be evaluated for attitudinal change and acceptability in a pilot study at an urban public STD clinic. Use of the hand held computer with its small screen and use of a headset, promote privacy during data collection. The pilot study will use a pretest-posttest design. The development and evaluation of this approach are preliminary to a RO1 research proposal to study the effectiveness of a computerized decision support intervention that will rely on automated rules to deliver tailored, video health promotion messages as feedback to HIV risk behavior. This project addresses a gap in the literature concerning acceptability and feasibility of videos on a hand held computer as an approach to HIV risk reduction. It also addresses the following NINR research themes: Changing lifestyle behaviors for better health, identification of effective strategies to reduce health disparities, and harnessing advanced technologies to serve human needs. This proposal addresses a Healthy People 2010 objective on health communication, specifically when literacy may be a concern.            ",Changing Women's HIV Risk: Videos on Hand Held Computers,6951531,R03NR009349,"['telemedicine ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' AIDS education /prevention ', ' human subject ', ' HIV infection ', ' videotape /videodisc ', ' nursing intervention ', ' attitude ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' sex behavior ', "" women's health "", ' interactive multimedia ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' focus group ', ' ']",NINR,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ NEWARK,R03,2005,77750,0.055235130462272804
"Economic Opportunity for Zimbabwean Adolescent Orphans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this project is to determine, using a randomized controlled design, whether an innovative economic and life-skills intervention designed to increase control over sexual interactions prevents the adverse consequences of unprotected sex among out-of-school female orphans aged 16-19 in Zimbabwe. The intervention, which builds on our recently completed study that assessed the feasibility of such a program, will be evaluated for its effect on the acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, as well as unintended pregnancy. The intervention consists of an integrated micro-credit program, including entrepreneurial training, loan provision, practical business education, mentorship, and peer support groups. This will be combined with a previously-tested fife-skills education curriculum that delivers HIV/reproductive health education through the use of role plays, drawing exercises, and other techniques, to help participants negotiate the terms of their sexual relationships. In order to assess the effects of this combined intervention over and above life-skills alone, the control group will receive the fife-skills education curriculum, a ""placebo"" health and nutrition training, and on-going peer support groups. Although there is great potential for such combined economic and life-skills programs to improve the reproductive health of female adolescent orphans, no research to date has assessed the effect of such interventions on sexual risk behaviors, STI/HIV or pregnancy outcomes in this or any other at-risk group. Our intervention is guided by a causal model in which the provision of economic alternatives and opportunities (through the micro-credit intervention) and sexual negotiation skills (through the life-skills intervention) are the driving forces in increasing control over sexual interactions, and thus reducing high-risk behaviors and adverse biological outcomes. The specific aims of this project are: 1) To assess the effectiveness of a combined micro-credit and life-skills education intervention in reducing the incidence of our primary outcomes: Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2) and unintended pregnancy; 2) To assess the effectiveness of a combined micro-credit and life-skills education intervention in reducing our secondary outcomes: high-risk risk behaviors (e.g., unprotected sex, number of partners, transactional sex, early sexual debut, sexual coercion and violence); 3) To examine the intermediary effects of increased economic opportunity and improved sexual negotiation skills in enhancing participants' control over sexual interactions, and 4) To evaluate whether characteristics related to participation, i.e., factors related to participant adherence, satisfaction, and understanding of the intervention mediate observed effects.

"Men on the Move    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Background: Public health is what we, as a society, do collectively to ensure the conditions in which people can be healthy. While access to affordable and quality health care and health behaviors are clearly related to health outcomes, recent work has reminded us as a field that social, economic and environmental conditions account for a large portion of the mortality in the United States. Moreover, the literature describing the relationship between conditions needed for health, commonly referred to as social determinants (e.g., living, working and social conditions, institutions, systems, and resources such as employment opportunities, education, safe housing), and health outcomes has documented that the unequal distribution of these conditions across various populations is a significant contributor to persistent and pervasive health disparities in the U.S. and elsewhere, and that without attention to these conditions we will most surely fail in our efforts to eliminate health disparities. Overview: Men on the Move will develop educational and economic opportunities for men using community based participatory action research approaches. Specific Aims: 1: To develop a plan to improve access to educational and economic opportunities among men within Pemiscot County (enhance partnerships and bridging social capital, conduct community assessment of residents, nonprofit organizations, local government officials and local businesses using community and research personnel for data collection; jointly analyze data and develop specific objectives and activities) and 2: To pilot test the educational and economic development programs developed (provide training to community residents to implement programs and collect program data) Innovation and Dissemination: This program will address two factors community members have identified as being associated with several community health concerns - educational and economic opportunities. The findings from our work will be disseminated within the community and in local and national venues.           ",Men on the Move,7056366,R24MD001590,"['educationally disadvantaged ', ' education evaluation /planning ', ' public health ', ' health economics ', ' human subject ', ' interview ', ' questionnaire ', ' employment /unemployment ', ' industry ', ' health survey ', ' social cooperation ', ' male ', ' African American ', ' socioeconomics ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' community ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' educational resource design /development ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIMHD,SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY,R24,2005,512757,0.036201850135094846
"Computer-Based HIV Prevention for African-American Women PROJECT SUMMARY: While the overall HIV infection rates in the US have been remained relatively constant, disparities in rates between Whites and members of other racial/ethnic groups continue to grow. Several behavioral prevention interventions tailored for African-Americans have shown efficacy in reducing sexual risk behaviors. However, their successful replication has been hampered by cost, implementation difficulties, and participant retention issues. The proposed project seeks to address these barriers to reducing HIV/AIDS rates by developing and empirically validating research-based, computerized versions of efficacious in-person HIV programs for African-American females, and making these computerized programs accessible to service provision agencies at low cost via CD-ROM and the Internet. Specific objectives include: (1) to increase service agencies' ability to implement efficacious HIV interventions with fidelity; (2) to increase African-American females' participation in efficacious HIV interventions; and (3) to ultimately, to reduce sexual risk behaviors and HIV infection rates among African-American females. In Phase I we will: (a) develop a computer-based version of SiSTA, an in-person, group-administered HIV prevention program for young African-American women that has demonstrated efficacy in reducing sexual risk behavior; and (b) validate computer-based SiSTA (""Digitized SiSTA"") through a randomized controlled trial in which Digitized SiSTA's effects are compared to those of group-administered SiSTA (""Group SiSTA""). Digitized SiSTA will be developed in collaboration with Group SiSTA's developers, who will be project Co-Investigators, and it will be informed by focus groups and pilot testing with the target population. If Phase I is successful, in Phase II we will develop and validate computer-based versions of other efficacious group programs for African-American females. RELEVANCE: The proposed research will make proven-effective HIV prevention programs for African-American women available to health service organizations at low cost and will facilitate their cost-effective implementation. It will also promote community members' participation in the interventios by permitting sensitive topics to be addressed privately (i.e., one-on-one with the computer) and according to a flexible schedule. Ultimately, it will help to reduce sexual risk-taking behavior and HIV infection rates among African-American girls and women, who are disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

"Disposition Decisions by Couples with Frozen Embryos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this qualitative research is to better understand how infertile couples who have undergone in vitro fertilization decide what to do with their surplus frozen embryos. Because this question is complicated by the variety and disparity of the embryo's potential uses and dispositions, e.g., they can be used by the couple in further attempts to conceive, ""donated"" to other infertile couples who wish to have a child, used in stem cell research, or stored indefinitely, discarded, or destroyed, the limited available data suggests that couples address this decision with considerable uncertainty and ambivalence. This 48-month ethnographic study would be the first in-depth examination of how couples think about their frozen embryos and formulate their disposition decision. The research will study 100 couples longitudinally over a one-year period, using  three in-depth interviews of husbands and wives separately and together at six-month intervals, inducting participants who have frozen embryos in storage for between one and ten years. Qualitative data analysis will then proceed in a seven-step progression. The specific aims of this research are: (1) to examine the meanings that women and men attach to embryos; (2) to understand how women and men think about embryos in relation to concepts of the family; (3) to explore differences and similarities in how women and men conceptualize embryos; and (4) to describe the process women and men engage in as they consider the disposition of their frozen embryos, and whether their views of what should be done change over time. An exploration of the frozen embryo disposition decision would not only deepen our understanding of changing cultural notions about the meaning of family, but would inform several specific areas of public health policy that are currently mired in ambiguity, uncertainty, and controversy, e.g., the responsibilities and obligations of IVF clinics, the use of frozen embryos for stem cell research, and the ""donation"" or ""adoption"" of frozen embryos.

"Social Context and HIV Risk among Mexican Gay Immigrants  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed ethnographic study seeks to investigate the nature of changes in the lives of Mexican gay and bisexual male immigrants that result in increased HIV risk. This study builds on previous quantitative research with Latino gay and bisexual men that paradoxically found that recent immigrants have much lower levels of HIV risk than their U.S-born counterparts, and that their risk increases with their length of residence in the US. The proposed study's specific aims are: (1) To describe the processes of incorporation into US gay life among Mexican gay and bisexual male immigrants and how their participation in social and sexual contexts in the United States affects their sexual health and HIV risk; (2) to compare the Mexican gay and bisexual immigrants' lived experiences regarding sexuality and HIV risk with those of their US-born counterparts; (3) to advance our theoretical knowledge about the emergence of health risks out of the intersection of migration, sexual orientation, participation in US social settings, and social inequality; and (4) to generate and disseminate data that HIV educators can directly use to design and improve HIV prevention programs for gay and bisexual Mexican immigrants. The study will consist of individual qualitative interviews with 150 men (2.5 hours per interview on average), follow-up interviews twelve months after the initial interview (1.25 hours per interview on average), and twenty-seven months of participant observation in social settings (Latino and non-Latino, gay and heterosexual) where gay and bisexual Mexican immigrants participate (4,360 hours of participant observation projected). These research activities will be conducted in San Diego, California. The collected textual data (field notes and interview transcripts) will be systematically coded for analysis. In broadest terms, the proposed research rejects monolithic conceptions of ethnic communities and contributes to the larger effort to study cultural diversity within ethnic minority communities in the US and the influence of such internal diversity on health. In this particular study, we focus on migration that is motivated by a homosexual orientation and seek to elucidate how it influences intra-group diversity in Latino communities in terms of sexuality and sexual identities, sexual behavior, participation and incorporation in US social settings, and sexual health.

"Love, Marriage, and HIV: Gender and HIV Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Objective: For women in many parts of the world, the behavior that puts them at greatest risk for HIV infection is unprotected sex within marriage. The proposed comparative ethnographic study will explore how social and cultural factors influence marital and extramarital intimate relationships and examine the sexual and the HIV prevention practices of men and women engaged in building these relationships across five locations in countries at different stages of the HIV epidemic. By detailing the processes through which contextual factors shape women's risk of marital HIV infection, this study will contribute to our understanding of ways to reduce the risk of heterosexual HIV transmission.  Background and Significance: The study is guided by three premises:  that the role of married men in sustaining heterosexual transmission of HIV has been insufficiently explored; that spreading ideologies of monogamous companionate marriage may put married women at particular risk, and that culturally specific knowledge about the social, economic, and emotional context of sexual relationships can provide important insight into the avenues through which gender inequality combines with economic organization and emerging ideologies of marital love to put women at  risk for marital HIV transmission.  Methods: Five developing country sites representing different stages of the HIV epidemic have been selected for study: Degollado, Jalisco Tari, Papua New Guinea, Soc Son, Vietnam, Ubakala, Nigeria, and Bulubandi, Uganda. In each site, researchers will use ethnographic methods to examine the social and cultural determinants of the risk of marital transmission of HIV. We anticipate totals of 200 semi-structured ethnographic interviews with a systematic ethnographic sample of men and women (40 per site) and 100 marital case histories (20 per site), to be collected over 6 months of participant observation. For each field site, ethnographic data will be analyzed using a multilevel hierarchical coding process to relate specific attitudes and behaviors to relationship- and macro-level factors. The ethnographic findings will be pooled to conduct an analysis of key themes and findings across sites.  Implications: The assumption that marriage equals monogamy may be costing women their lives. Data from this project will be used to trace the social and ideological contexts within which men and women build sexual relationships and become exposed to HIV risk and to develop proposals for culturally appropriate, gender-sensitive interventions to reduce this risk.           ","Love, Marriage, and HIV: Gender and HIV Risk",6921408,R01HD041724,"['communicable disease transmission ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' AIDS education /prevention ', ' marriage /marital status ', ' Africa ', ' Mexico ', ' southeast Asia ', ' human subject ', ' HIV infection ', ' interview ', ' epidemiology ', ' attitude ', ' sex behavior ', ' gender difference ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' socioeconomics ', ' culture ', "" women's health "", ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' Papua New Guinea ', ' ']",NICHD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2005,286285,0.04611085614700985
"Woman Focused HIV Prevention with African-Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised competing continuation proposes to examine the long-term effects of the Women's CoOp intervention funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). HIV surveillance indicates that underclass African-Americans in the South continue to be at high risk for HIV and face significant health disparities through poverty, unemployment, and homelessness. Intervention research has demonstrated that HIV is preventable through safer drug and sexual practices, and that HIV risk behaviors can and do change. However, African-American women who live in poverty experience unique social contexts that affect HIV risk. These contexts need to be addressed in sustaining HIV risk reduction. The Women's CoOp study has demonstrated that a gender-based, individualized HIV prevention intervention with inner-city African-American women who use crack cocaine is effective in reducing HIV risk behaviors and empowering these women to begin to change their social contexts of employment and homelessness. These findings suggest that the women who were able to positively change their social contexts by becoming employed or finding homes had greater reductions in sexual risk for HIV than those who remained unemployed or homeless. However, it is not known if these risk-reduction behaviors can be sustained over time. Many African-American women who live in high-risk communities face environmental stressors that may facilitate relapse to drug and sexual risk behaviors. The next empirical question for the Women's CoOp study is to determine the long-term effects of the Woman-Focused intervention with regard to drug and sexual risk for HIV, self-sufficiency, and a woman's ability to sustain change within her social context. Further, we posit that briefer interventions at regular intervals will be more effective in sustaining behavior change and be more cost-effective. The specific aims of the proposed study are as follows: Aim 1. To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a culturally specific, woman-focused intervention relative to the NIDA standard intervention in terms of crack use and sexual risk behaviors and self-sufficiency (e.g., employment, housing). Aim 2. To compare the effectiveness of a culturally specific, woman-focused booster follow-up intervention--relative to the NIDA standard booster follow-up intervention offered biannually--to sustain reductions in crack use and sexual risk and improve self-sufficiency at 6, 12, and 18 months post reenrollment among Women's CoOp participants. Aim 3. To examine the mediating effects of employment and housing, as well as moderators, such as age, abuse history and psychological distress, on the effectiveness of the intervention at changing HIV risk behaviors at 6, 12, and 18 months post reenrollment. Aim 4. To estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of a culturally specific, woman-focused intervention relative to the NIDA standard in terms of crack use and sexual risk behaviors.

"HIV Risk & Migration -Young Yi Minority - Sichuan China DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Southeast and central Asia are witnessing rapid penetration by the global market economy. The urbanization that has paralleled this economic transformation has brought with it an increased spread of communicable diseases, often in areas with limited public health resources. Expansions in migrants' involvement in the urban-based informal labor sector is of particular concern because movement between urban centers and remote rural regions may serve as a mechanism for diffusing both behavioral risk practices as well as infectious diseases themselves. With a long history of social and economic marginalization, and increasing dependence on urban-based migrant labor, the Yi minorities are an especially vulnerable ethnic group in southern China. This socio-economic vulnerability may be exacerbated by the general lack of knowledge about transmission of HIV and STD's in the region. Developed as an exploratory pilot study using the R21 mechanism, this application proposes a targeted set of ethnographic methods with which to elaborate our understanding of how and why migrant labor may confer unique health risks, notably high risk for exposure to drug and sexual risk practices. We propose to focus on young adult Yi because our preliminary work suggests that many Yi become involved in migrant labor early in their adult lives and that exposure to drug and sexual risk also occur early. Since our pilot work suggests that gender is an important influence on the economic roles that men and women occupy in migrant labor, we propose to study both men and women. Based on an established ethnographic research design, the study will begin with a set of formative research activities that will serve to orient the research team in the local communities where the study will be conducted. Additionally, a small group of key participants will be recruited for a series of ethnographic interviews that will include questions about life history and life course events, family experience, education and skills acquisition, subsistence and income generating strategies, knowledge and beliefs about HIV/STD's, initiation of drug and sexual risk activities, and experiences of stigma (N=60). Interviews will yield information that will allow us to construct a preliminary epidemiological trajectory of how drug and sexual risk practices are initiated, and key features of the early course of behavioral risk, that would need to be anticipated in future research and prevention activities.

"Predictors of HIV Risks Among Urban Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Objectives: A disproportionate number of urban African American youth are engaging in HIV sexual risk behaviors. Accumulating evidence suggests that among youth, factors such as family and community violence exposure, psychological distress, low school achievement and negative peer group associations are related to HIV sexual risk behaviors. However, to date, no research has examined the interrelationships among these variables with regards to Urban African American youth and their disproportionate rates of HIV infection. Guided by a developmental framework, this exploratory study investigates whether higher levels of psychological distress, lower school achievement, and increased negative peer group association mediates the relationship between family and community violence exposure and increased HIV sexual risk behaviors.       Design: Using audio-computer assisted self-interviewing technology, data on socio-demographics, violence exposure, psychological distress, school achievement, peer associations, and sexual behaviors will be collected from 300 African American youth in the 9th and 10th grades, attending a high school on Chicago's Southside. Structural equation modeling (SEM) would examine the relationships among variables.       Conclusions: The findings from this study hold promise for increasing our understanding of the interrelationship among key factors associated with risky sexual behaviors among urban African American youth. Such knowledge is critical to designing HIV prevention programs that are culture-specific, in order to curtail the increasing spread of infection.         ",Predictors of HIV Risks Among Urban Youth,6966664,R03HD049283,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' computer program /software ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' drug abuse ', ' family structure /dynamics ', ' human subject ', ' AIDS ', ' HIV infection ', ' interview ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' sex behavior ', ' negative reinforcement ', ' academic achievement ', ' peer group ', ' African American ', ' socioeconomics ', ' urban area ', ' culture ', ' psychological stressor ', ' violence ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' substance abuse related behavior ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R03,2005,76291,-0.0002678608805798609
"Love, Marriage, and HIV: Gender and HIV Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Objective: For women in many parts of the world, the behavior that puts them at greatest risk for HIV infection is unprotected sex within marriage. The proposed comparative ethnographic study will explore how social and cultural factors influence marital and extramarital intimate relationships and examine the sexual and the HIV prevention practices of men and women engaged in building these relationships across five locations in countries at different stages of the HIV epidemic. By detailing the processes through which contextual factors shape women's risk of marital HIV infection, this study will contribute to our understanding of ways to reduce the risk of heterosexual HIV transmission.  Background and Significance: The study is guided by three premises:  that the role of married men in sustaining heterosexual transmission of HIV has been insufficiently explored; that spreading ideologies of monogamous companionate marriage may put married women at particular risk, and that culturally specific knowledge about the social, economic, and emotional context of sexual relationships can provide important insight into the avenues through which gender inequality combines with economic organization and emerging ideologies of marital love to put women at  risk for marital HIV transmission.  Methods: Five developing country sites representing different stages of the HIV epidemic have been selected for study: Degollado, Jalisco Tari, Papua New Guinea, Soc Son, Vietnam, Ubakala, Nigeria, and Bulubandi, Uganda. In each site, researchers will use ethnographic methods to examine the social and cultural determinants of the risk of marital transmission of HIV. We anticipate totals of 200 semi-structured ethnographic interviews with a systematic ethnographic sample of men and women (40 per site) and 100 marital case histories (20 per site), to be collected over 6 months of participant observation. For each field site, ethnographic data will be analyzed using a multilevel hierarchical coding process to relate specific attitudes and behaviors to relationship- and macro-level factors. The ethnographic findings will be pooled to conduct an analysis of key themes and findings across sites.  Implications: The assumption that marriage equals monogamy may be costing women their lives. Data from this project will be used to trace the social and ideological contexts within which men and women build sexual relationships and become exposed to HIV risk and to develop proposals for culturally appropriate, gender-sensitive interventions to reduce this risk.           ","Love, Marriage, and HIV: Gender and HIV Risk",7107280,R01HD041724,"['communicable disease transmission ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' AIDS education /prevention ', ' marriage /marital status ', ' Africa ', ' Mexico ', ' southeast Asia ', ' human subject ', ' HIV infection ', ' interview ', ' epidemiology ', ' attitude ', ' sex behavior ', ' gender difference ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' socioeconomics ', ' culture ', "" women's health "", ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' Papua New Guinea ', ' ']",NICHD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,223177,0.04611085614700985
"Disposition Decisions by Couples with Frozen Embryos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this qualitative research is to better understand how infertile couples who have undergone in vitro fertilization decide what to do with their surplus frozen embryos. Because this question is complicated by the variety and disparity of the embryo's potential uses and dispositions, e.g., they can be used by the couple in further attempts to conceive, ""donated"" to other infertile couples who wish to have a child, used in stem cell research, or stored indefinitely, discarded, or destroyed, the limited available data suggests that couples address this decision with considerable uncertainty and ambivalence. This 48-month ethnographic study would be the first in-depth examination of how couples think about their frozen embryos and formulate their disposition decision. The research will study 100 couples longitudinally over a one-year period, using  three in-depth interviews of husbands and wives separately and together at six-month intervals, inducting participants who have frozen embryos in storage for between one and ten years. Qualitative data analysis will then proceed in a seven-step progression. The specific aims of this research are: (1) to examine the meanings that women and men attach to embryos; (2) to understand how women and men think about embryos in relation to concepts of the family; (3) to explore differences and similarities in how women and men conceptualize embryos; and (4) to describe the process women and men engage in as they consider the disposition of their frozen embryos, and whether their views of what should be done change over time. An exploration of the frozen embryo disposition decision would not only deepen our understanding of changing cultural notions about the meaning of family, but would inform several specific areas of public health policy that are currently mired in ambiguity, uncertainty, and controversy, e.g., the responsibilities and obligations of IVF clinics, the use of frozen embryos for stem cell research, and the ""donation"" or ""adoption"" of frozen embryos.

"Economic Opportunity for Zimbabwean Adolescent Orphans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this project is to determine, using a randomized controlled design, whether an innovative economic and life-skills intervention designed to increase control over sexual interactions prevents the adverse consequences of unprotected sex among out-of-school female orphans aged 16-19 in Zimbabwe. The intervention, which builds on our recently completed study that assessed the feasibility of such a program, will be evaluated for its effect on the acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, as well as unintended pregnancy. The intervention consists of an integrated micro-credit program, including entrepreneurial training, loan provision, practical business education, mentorship, and peer support groups. This will be combined with a previously-tested fife-skills education curriculum that delivers HIV/reproductive health education through the use of role plays, drawing exercises, and other techniques, to help participants negotiate the terms of their sexual relationships. In order to assess the effects of this combined intervention over and above life-skills alone, the control group will receive the fife-skills education curriculum, a ""placebo"" health and nutrition training, and on-going peer support groups. Although there is great potential for such combined economic and life-skills programs to improve the reproductive health of female adolescent orphans, no research to date has assessed the effect of such interventions on sexual risk behaviors, STI/HIV or pregnancy outcomes in this or any other at-risk group. Our intervention is guided by a causal model in which the provision of economic alternatives and opportunities (through the micro-credit intervention) and sexual negotiation skills (through the life-skills intervention) are the driving forces in increasing control over sexual interactions, and thus reducing high-risk behaviors and adverse biological outcomes. The specific aims of this project are: 1) To assess the effectiveness of a combined micro-credit and life-skills education intervention in reducing the incidence of our primary outcomes: Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2) and unintended pregnancy; 2) To assess the effectiveness of a combined micro-credit and life-skills education intervention in reducing our secondary outcomes: high-risk risk behaviors (e.g., unprotected sex, number of partners, transactional sex, early sexual debut, sexual coercion and violence); 3) To examine the intermediary effects of increased economic opportunity and improved sexual negotiation skills in enhancing participants' control over sexual interactions, and 4) To evaluate whether characteristics related to participation, i.e., factors related to participant adherence, satisfaction, and understanding of the intervention mediate observed effects.

"Proyecto SOL: A Risk Reduction Intervention for Hispanic MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic men who have sex with men (HMSM) have been highly impacted by the HIV epidemic, both nationally and in the Miami metropolitan statistical area (MSA). Despite the urgent need, few theoretically based, culturally appropriate behavioral interventions to reduce risk of sexual acquisition or transmission of HIV among HMSM have been developed and rigorously tested Our team has been engaged in community- based HIV prevention research with HMSM (R01-DA-16026; R01 MH-62700; U-R3-CCU-41644) that informed the development of the draft curricula of Proyecto SOL, whose preliminary efficacy we are proposing to test in this application. Proyecto SOL is a theoretically grounded, culturally based, group level intervention to reduce risk of HIV acquisition or transmission among HMSM with two versions: SOL-I (for HMSM whose HIV serostatus is negative or unknown), and SOL-II (for HMSM who are HIV positive). In this application, we propose to participate in an initiative to examine preliminary efficacy of promising behavioral interventions for HMSM that has both collaborative and site specific components. In the initial phase of project, we will convene 6-8 focus groups and conduct 2 to 3 ""dry-runs"" to finalize the two versions (including manuals) of Proyecto SOL. We will finalize the site-specific assessment; program and bench test the ACASI, train staff etc. During this phase, we will also work with the multi-site study group to develop the core set of assessment items, control intervention (TBD-CONTROL), define the recruitment procedures etc., and complete additional activities of relevance to the initiative. During Years 2 and 3, we will conduct two parallel randomized control trials (RCT) to determine preliminary efficacy, acceptability, and feasibility of each version of Proyecto SOL compared with the TBD-CONTROL. We will test whether key factors (cultural orientation, racism, perceptions of sexual control, and internalized homonegativity) directly linked to risk and protection among HMSM in our past studies moderate intervention effects. For Study 1, we will recruit 120 HMSM of negative or unknown serostatus and randomly assign them to SOL-I or TBD-CONTROL. For Study 2, we will recruit 120 HIV positive HMSM and randomly assign them to SOL-II or TBD-CONTROL. Although we propose to recruit in community and internet venues for both studies, final decisions regarding recruitment approaches will be made collaboratively. Assessments using ACASI will be done at baseline and 3 months post intervention. Acceptability and feasibility assessments will be completed after each intervention session. Throughout the project period, we will continue to collaborate with the multi-site study group by participating in scheduled conference calls, attending meetings, preparing manuscripts, presenting at local, national and international meetings and other work of relevance to the initiative.           ",Proyecto SOL: A Risk Reduction Intervention for Hispanic MSM,7231145,UR6PS000433,"['clinical trial ', ' cooperative study ', ' AIDS education /prevention ', ' human subject ', ' HIV infection ', ' information dissemination ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' sex behavior ', ' homosexual ', ' group therapy ', ' male ', ' Hispanic American ', ' human therapy evaluation ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' safe sex /sex abstinence ', ' health disparity ', ' therapy design /development ', ' ']",NCHHSTP,NOVA SOUTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UR6,2006,296277,-0.00814283507027715
"Keep It Up: Peak Performance for Life HIV Intervention for African American Males    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Education Development Center, Inc. and Medgar Evers College of the City University of New York will develop and pilot test the Keep It Up: Peak Performance for Life program targeted to African American and other Black young men in high-poverty communities where HIV, other sexually transmitted infections (STI), substance use and unintentional pregnancies are elevated. This integrated structural, community, and individual-level intervention embeds HIV behavioral prevention and testing within a comprehensive social marketing and health screening program. This ground-breaking intervention incorporates four core elements: (1) Culturally tailored and male-targeted social marketing campaign to raise awareness about sexual health and the Keep It Up: Peak Performance for Life program; (2) Sexual and general health screening that includes simple, relatively non-invasive biologic testing for HIV, as well hypertension, cholesterol, diabetes, lung function and other STI, which are related to longer-term chronic diseases and sexual dysfunction; (3) Brief, engaging computerized HIV behavioral risk reduction that uses video clips and interactive activities to trigger self-assessment of risk, increase motivation for safer behaviors and relationships, model condom use and negotiation skills, and provide normative support; and (4) Personalized health profile and HIV risk reduction plan. Keep It Up seeks to ""normalize"" HIV prevention and testing in the context of a convenient, relatively non-invasive health check-up for men, similar to routine reproductive health care provided to women. The specific aims are to: 1. Conduct formative research to refine the core elements and content of the Keep It Up: Peak Performance for Life health promotion program for African American and other Black young men; 2. Finalize the Keep It Up: Peak Performance for Life core elements and materials; 3. Collaborate with the CDC multi-site committee to develop evaluation materials that can be used across sites to provide preliminary evidence of whether the intervention leads to change in HIV risk behaviors; 4. Pilot the intervention and enroll a sample of about 100 African American and other Black young men in a repeated-measures pre-post test with a 3-month follow up to determine whether the approach is promising and merits further evaluation. Keep It Up is designed for young men to receive HIV behavioral prevention and HIV testing quickly and conveniently in a non-threatening and non-stigmatized community setting. In addition to HIV prevention, the goal is to market health promotion to a population of African American men who bear a disproportionate burden of not only HIV/AIDS but other chronic conditions that lead to ongoing health disparities.              ",Keep It Up: Peak Performance for Life HIV Intervention for African American Males,7229245,UR6PS000399,"['cooperative study ', ' health education ', ' AIDS education /prevention ', ' human subject ', ' male ', ' African American ', ' clinical research ', ' ']",NCHHSTP,"EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT CENTER, INC.",UR6,2006,195548,0.04856405655692342
"Men on the Move    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Background: Public health is what we, as a society, do collectively to ensure the conditions in which people can be healthy. While access to affordable and quality health care and health behaviors are clearly related to health outcomes, recent work has reminded us as a field that social, economic and environmental conditions account for a large portion of the mortality in the United States. Moreover, the literature describing the relationship between conditions needed for health, commonly referred to as social determinants (e.g., living, working and social conditions, institutions, systems, and resources such as employment opportunities, education, safe housing), and health outcomes has documented that the unequal distribution of these conditions across various populations is a significant contributor to persistent and pervasive health disparities in the U.S. and elsewhere, and that without attention to these conditions we will most surely fail in our efforts to eliminate health disparities. Overview: Men on the Move will develop educational and economic opportunities for men using community based participatory action research approaches. Specific Aims: 1: To develop a plan to improve access to educational and economic opportunities among men within Pemiscot County (enhance partnerships and bridging social capital, conduct community assessment of residents, nonprofit organizations, local government officials and local businesses using community and research personnel for data collection; jointly analyze data and develop specific objectives and activities) and 2: To pilot test the educational and economic development programs developed (provide training to community residents to implement programs and collect program data) Innovation and Dissemination: This program will address two factors community members have identified as being associated with several community health concerns - educational and economic opportunities.

"Woman Focused HIV Prevention with African-Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised competing continuation proposes to examine the long-term effects of the Women's CoOp intervention funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). HIV surveillance indicates that underclass African-Americans in the South continue to be at high risk for HIV and face significant health disparities through poverty, unemployment, and homelessness. Intervention research has demonstrated that HIV is preventable through safer drug and sexual practices, and that HIV risk behaviors can and do change. However, African-American women who live in poverty experience unique social contexts that affect HIV risk. These contexts need to be addressed in sustaining HIV risk reduction. The Women's CoOp study has demonstrated that a gender-based, individualized HIV prevention intervention with inner-city African-American women who use crack cocaine is effective in reducing HIV risk behaviors and empowering these women to begin to change their social contexts of employment and homelessness. These findings suggest that the women who were able to positively change their social contexts by becoming employed or finding homes had greater reductions in sexual risk for HIV than those who remained unemployed or homeless. However, it is not known if these risk-reduction behaviors can be sustained over time. Many African-American women who live in high-risk communities face environmental stressors that may facilitate relapse to drug and sexual risk behaviors. The next empirical question for the Women's CoOp study is to determine the long-term effects of the Woman-Focused intervention with regard to drug and sexual risk for HIV, self-sufficiency, and a woman's ability to sustain change within her social context. Further, we posit that briefer interventions at regular intervals will be more effective in sustaining behavior change and be more cost-effective. The specific aims of the proposed study are as follows: Aim 1. To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a culturally specific, woman-focused intervention relative to the NIDA standard intervention in terms of crack use and sexual risk behaviors and self-sufficiency (e.g., employment, housing). Aim 2. To compare the effectiveness of a culturally specific, woman-focused booster follow-up intervention--relative to the NIDA standard booster follow-up intervention offered biannually--to sustain reductions in crack use and sexual risk and improve self-sufficiency at 6, 12, and 18 months post reenrollment among Women's CoOp participants. Aim 3. To examine the mediating effects of employment and housing, as well as moderators, such as age, abuse history and psychological distress, on the effectiveness of the intervention at changing HIV risk behaviors at 6, 12, and 18 months post reenrollment.

"Understanding & Empowering Women's Health Negotiations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young women, particularly women of color, are at increasing risk from HIV in the United States today. Prevention efforts focused on increasing consistent condom use have had limited success.

"Promoting CIS Among Black Men in Barbershops    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Black men have a 25% higher overall cancer incidence; 40% higher overall cancer mortality; 1.3 times higher colorectal cancer mortality rates; and, 2.3 times higher prostate cancer mortality rates than White men. The Cancer Information Service (CIS) provides free, state-of-science information on cancer prevention and treatment that can help address cancer-related disparities. However between 2000 and 2004, 25.7% of NC callers were men, 13.7% were Black, and only 3% were Black men! Boyd et al. (1998) demonstrated that paid media (TV and radio) successfully increased CIS calls among Black men, but when removed, calls dropped off precipitously. Paid media is unrealistic for many rural and resource poor NC communities, whereas barbershops are located in every NC community. Black men frequent barbershops regularly, exchange all types of information, and build a trusted relationship with their barbers. Barbershops represent a promising place for disseminating simple, easy to implement interventions that encourage calls to CIS. The proposed pilot study will utilize community-based participatory research methods to test barbershop-based intervention strategies that encourage Black men to call CIS' 1-800-4-CANCER for colorectal and prostate cancer information. ""CUTS!"" (Cancer Understanding Today Study!) will be carried out in two phases: Phase 1 is formative research (interviews, observations, surveys) to gather information on barbershops, barbers, and barber-customer communication. Phase 2 is a 3-arm (attention control vs. print materials vs. print materials + barber training) group randomized controlled pilot study with 6 matched Black barbershops. Primary outcome is call volume to CIS' 1-800-4-CANCER (measured monthly); secondary outcomes (motivations, intentions, self-efficacy to call) are measured pre/post-intervention and as a 3 month follow-up. Process evaluation includes assessing recruitment, dose, cost, and fidelity. The proposed pilot study will yield important information required to develop innovative, context-specific, theory-driven barbershop interventions and to design a larger trial to further test interventions we find effective using an R01 mechanism. This approach is consistent with aims of this RFA and with community-based participatory research principles of collaborating with barbers/customers/owners that are committed to the long-term success of interventions to eliminate cancer disparities among Black men.           ",Promoting CIS Among Black Men in Barbershops,7226514,R21CA126373,"['neoplasm /cancer ', ' community ', ' clinical research ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2006,186150,-0.07460220239087914

(1998) demonstrated that paid media (TV and radio) successfully increased CIS calls among Black men, but when removed, calls dropped off precipitously. Paid media is unrealistic for many rural and resource poor NC communities, whereas barbershops are located in every NC community. Black men frequent barbershops regularly, exchange all types of information, and build a trusted relationship with their barbers. Barbershops represent a promising place for disseminating simple, easy to implement interventions that encourage calls to CIS. The proposed pilot study will utilize community-based participatory research methods to test barbershop-based intervention strategies that encourage Black men to call CIS' 1-800-4-CANCER for colorectal and prostate cancer information. ""CUTS!"" (Cancer Understanding Today Study!) will be carried out in two phases: Phase 1 is formative research (interviews, observations, surveys) to gather information on barbershops, barbers, and barber-customer communication. Phase 2 is a 3-arm (attention control vs. print materials vs. print materials + barber training) group randomized controlled pilot study with 6 matched Black barbershops. Primary outcome is call volume to CIS' 1-800-4-CANCER (measured monthly); secondary outcomes (motivations, intentions, self-efficacy to call) are measured pre/post-intervention and as a 3 month follow-up. Process evaluation includes assessing recruitment, dose, cost, and fidelity. The proposed pilot study will yield important information required to develop innovative, context-specific, theory-driven barbershop interventions and to design a larger trial to further test interventions we find effective using an R01 mechanism. This approach is consistent with aims of this RFA and with community-based participatory research principles of collaborating with barbers/customers/owners that are committed to the long-term success of interventions to eliminate cancer disparities among Black men.           ",Promoting CIS Among Black Men in Barbershops,7295810,R21CA126373,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Commit ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Radio ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Health Communication ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Information Service ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Personal Financing ', ' personal finances ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Focus Groups ', ' base ', ' Hotlines ', ' Telephone Hotlines ', ' Depth ', ' Phase ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Sciences ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Numbers ', ' Trust ', ' Rural ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Licensing ', ' Funding ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Phase II Clinical Trials ', ' phase II trial ', ' phase II protocol ', ' phase 2 trial ', ' Phase 2 Clinical Trials ', ' North Carolina ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Printing ', ' Staging ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Attention ', ' Work ', ' Scanning ', ' Awareness ', ' Upper arm ', ' Location ', ' size ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Church ', ' information gathering ', ' cancer risk ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' intervention program ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Prevention ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Today ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' falls ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Phase I Clinical Trials ', ' phase I trial ', ' phase I protocol ', ' phase 1 trial ', ' Phase 1 Clinical Trials ', ' Early-Stage Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Access to Information ', ' outreach to information ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' service utilization ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Drops ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2007,150627,-0.07460220239087914
"Environmental Gender Balance and HIV Risk for African-American Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and several other sexually transmitted infections (STI) is disproportionately high among African-American women as compared to women of other racial/ethnic groups (CDC, 2005a). Most infections in women are attributed to sexual contact with men (CDC, 2005b). Traditional approaches to sexual risk reduction have focused on individual behavior. However, some of the sexual relationship practices that increase women's sexual exposures may be related to characteristics of the social environment. Qualitative data suggest that some African-American women perceive that the relative lack of available heterosexual partners increases heterosexual risk behavior (Sobo 1993, 1995; Thomas & Thomas, 1999; Adimora & Shoenbach 2005). Few studies have considered the quantitative relationship between the relative availability of heterosexual partners or other environmental characteristics with sexual behavior or HIV/STI incidence or prevalence. The proposed analysis addresses the lack of information regarding the social context of racial/ethnic disparities in the prevalence of HIV/AIDS and STI in women in the U.S. The relative availability of heterosexual partners is reflected in the male-female sex ratio among nonincarcerated adults. The sex ratio and other characteristics of the social environment related to economic resources will be obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau and other sources. Individual data regarding sexual behavior, and self reports and biological markers of infection with HIV/STI will be obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The data will be linked geographically and analyzed using weighted multilevel regression modeling. The application of multilevel modeling constitutes an innovation in the analysis of the effects of environmental factors on sexual behavior and HIV/STI. Racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/STI infection rates among women may be understood more completely with a consideration of the sex ratio and other features of the social context of sexual relationship practices This research is relevant to public health because an imbalance in the number of men and women or other characteristics of the social environment may be related to increased rates of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Determining whether this is the case is important to design the best ways to prevent these illnesses. Lowering the highest rates of these illnesses can help to increase health and life expectancy overall, and help to reduce health disparities among racial/ethnic groups.           ",Environmental Gender Balance and HIV Risk for African-American Women,7321887,F31MH081367,"['Behavioral ', ' Female ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Household ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Infection ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Poverty ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Ratio ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Source ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Biologic Marker ', ' cohort ', ' expectation ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Disease regression ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Censuses ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Gender ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' men employment ', ' male employment ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' ']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,F31,2007,40972,0.07857012886709118
"Men on the Move    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Background: Public health is what we, as a society, do collectively to ensure the conditions in which people can be healthy. While access to affordable and quality health care and health behaviors are clearly related to health outcomes, recent work has reminded us as a field that social, economic and environmental conditions account for a large portion of the mortality in the United States. Moreover, the literature describing the relationship between conditions needed for health, commonly referred to as social determinants (e.g., living, working and social conditions, institutions, systems, and resources such as employment opportunities, education, safe housing), and health outcomes has documented that the unequal distribution of these conditions across various populations is a significant contributor to persistent and pervasive health disparities in the U.S. and elsewhere, and that without attention to these conditions we will most surely fail in our efforts to eliminate health disparities. Overview: Men on the Move will develop educational and economic opportunities for men using community based participatory action research approaches. Specific Aims: 1: To develop a plan to improve access to educational and economic opportunities among men within Pemiscot County (enhance partnerships and bridging social capital, conduct community assessment of residents, nonprofit organizations, local government officials and local businesses using community and research personnel for data collection; jointly analyze data and develop specific objectives and activities) and 2: To pilot test the educational and economic development programs developed (provide training to community residents to implement programs and collect program data) Innovation and Dissemination: This program will address two factors community members have identified as being associated with several community health concerns - educational and economic opportunities.

"Disposition Decisions by Couples with Frozen Embryos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this qualitative research is to better understand how infertile couples who have undergone in vitro fertilization decide what to do with their surplus frozen embryos. Because this question is complicated by the variety and disparity of the embryo's potential uses and dispositions, e.g., they can be used by the couple in further attempts to conceive, ""donated"" to other infertile couples who wish to have a child, used in stem cell research, or stored indefinitely, discarded, or destroyed, the limited available data suggests that couples address this decision with considerable uncertainty and ambivalence. This 48-month ethnographic study would be the first in-depth examination of how couples think about their frozen embryos and formulate their disposition decision. The research will study 100 couples longitudinally over a one-year period, using  three in-depth interviews of husbands and wives separately and together at six-month intervals, inducting participants who have frozen embryos in storage for between one and ten years. Qualitative data analysis will then proceed in a seven-step progression. The specific aims of this research are: (1) to examine the meanings that women and men attach to embryos; (2) to understand how women and men think about embryos in relation to concepts of the family; (3) to explore differences and similarities in how women and men conceptualize embryos; and (4) to describe the process women and men engage in as they consider the disposition of their frozen embryos, and whether their views of what should be done change over time. An exploration of the frozen embryo disposition decision would not only deepen our understanding of changing cultural notions about the meaning of family, but would inform several specific areas of public health policy that are currently mired in ambiguity, uncertainty, and controversy, e.g., the responsibilities and obligations of IVF clinics, the use of frozen embryos for stem cell research, and the ""donation"" or ""adoption"" of frozen embryos.

"Young Women With Acute Myocardial Infarction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young women with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) represent an extreme phenotype in ischemic heart disease risk and, at the same time, constitute a large understudied group with excess mortality risk compared with similarly aged men. This combination of adverse risk and inadequate investigation provides a critically important opportunity to address the care and outcomes of young women with AMI to uncover key biological and environmental determinants of their prognosis. Accordingly, we propose the first large, comprehensive, observational study of young women with AMI (YWAMI). YWAMI will include 2,000 women, 18-55 years of age, with AMI and a comparison cohort of 1,000 men enrolled over 3 years from 88 hospitals across the United States and in Canada. To accomplish these aims we have assembled a team of leading researchers in sex disparities in cardiovascular disease, outcomes research, epidemiology, statistics, genetics, biomarker research, health status measurement, psychosocial research, cardiology, and emergency medicine. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) characterize sex differences in outcomes following AMI (including mortality, hospitalization and health status); 2) determine sex differences in the prevalence of demographic, clinical, and psychosocial risk factors; 3) determine sex differences in quality of care; and 4) determine sex differences in the prevalence of selected biological factors (including sex hormones, biomarkers and genetic variations). We will characterize these differences in great detail and elucidate the biological and environmental factors that are responsible for disparities in outcomes. The analyses from all four aims will be used to develop clinically useful risk-stratification models for young AMI patients, explain sex differences in outcomes and identify targets for intervention. We will also bank serum and DMA from each subject, creating a resource for anticipated future studies of the molecular biology of AMI in young women and men. We will work with the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association and VHA, Inc. to disseminate findings from this study that can be used to improve the prevention, care, and outcomes for young women and men with AMI. Public Health Implications: Overall, although heart disease in young women accounts for as many deaths as breast cancer, few studies have addressed the biological, environmental and social factors that influence their outcome. Young women with heart attacks have a higher risk of dying than similarly aged men. We propose to conduct the largest, most comprehensive study of young women with heart attacks to identify the key determinants of their recovery and discover knowledge that will assist us in improving their care.              ",Young Women With Acute Myocardial Infarction,7265684,R01HL081153,"['Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' heart disease risk ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogenic Compounds ', ' Estrogenic Agents ', ' Caring ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Prognostic Factor ', ' Prognostic/Survival Factor ', ' General Prognostic Factor ', ' Range ', ' Stratification ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Genetic Status ', ' Observational Study ', ' Update ', ' sex ', ' Cardiac ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Female ', ' Guidelines ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' improved ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Reproductive History ', ' Reproductive Issues ', ' Reproductive History Epidemiology ', ' Reproductive Factors ', ' Inflammation ', ' Inpatients ', ' Ensure ', ' prognostic ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Numbers ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' American Heart Association ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Menstrual cycle ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Patients ', ' Metabolic ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Physicians ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' sex steroid ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Biologic Marker ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' lipid metabolism ', ' fat metabolism ', ' cohort ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Canada ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Cardiology ', ' Cardiovascular Disease (Specialty) ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' social ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' genetic resource ', ' Accounting ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' comparison group ', ' neglect ', ' genetic variant ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' older women ', ' ']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,2471501,0.03916140872141774
"PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative (MARI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Rates of HIV infection are increasing among heterosexual young adult Black men. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advancing HIV prevention agenda calls for intervention through voluntary counseling and testing. However, young adults are less likely to be tested for HIV than older age groups and there are still large numbers of Black heterosexual men who do not get HIV tested. A goal of the study is to build HIV prevention research capacity in Black communities in which little research has been conducted. We will conduct qualitative interviews with 20 low income heterosexual young adult Black (non-Hispanic) men (ages 18-25 years) to examine barriers and facilitators to HIV testing and elicit their opinions of how to promote HIV testing among their peers. Based on the results from the qualitative interviews, a questionnaire will be developed to identify attitudes towards HIV testing, perceptions of HIV risk, socio-cultural influences (e.g., incarceration history, and male gender norms), and their relationship to HIV testing behaviors among low income heterosexual young adult Black men. Results from both the qualitative interviews and survey will be used to develop tailored educational materials that promote HIV testing among low income young adult heterosexual Black men. Three focus groups will then be conducted with low income heterosexual young adult men to evaluate the acceptability of the materials. Findings will increase our understanding of factors that influence HIV testing among Black heterosexual young adult men. In addition, HIV testing promotion materials developed through this study may have utility in increasing the number of heterosexual Black young adult men who get tested and therefore become aware of their HIV status. This proposal seeks to identify factors that influence HIV testing among low income heterosexual young adult Black men. The study will also develop tailored educational materials to promote HIV testing among this population. Specifically tailoring HIV testing messages for low income heterosexual young adult Black men may have utility in increasing the numbers among this population who get tested and therefore become aware of their HIV status. Therefore, this information may make a significant contribution to HIV prevention efforts and addresses a public health priority that fits with the goals of the US Department of Health and Human Services Healthy People 2010 initiative to eliminate health disparities related to HIV.           ","PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative (MARI)",7681335,U01PS000676,[''],NCHHSTP,ST.

"Reducing Sexual Risk Behaviors among Rural African-American Cocaine Users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV and other sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates continue to rise disproportionately among African-Americans, and particularly dramatically among rural populations. Stimulant use, especially cocaine use, among rural African-Americans is also increasing, and is related to multiple risk behaviors for HIV/STI, including sex with multiple partners, exchanging sex for drugs and other commodities, and inconsistent condom use. Despite these documented risk patterns, and the increasing disparities in HIV/STI incidence, few theory-based interventions have been specifically designed and tested for rural African-American populations with high-risk behavioral patterns. The primary aims of this project are to adapt an existing risk reduction program to the needs of rural African-American cocaine users, to test the adapted intervention's efficacy via a behavioral clinical trial, and to answer outstanding questions regarding intraclass correlation and sampling methodologies in the sexual risk reduction literature. The project team will conduct a longitudinal intervention study with stratified group randomization, so that participants receive the sexual risk intervention or an active control intervention condition in groups. Each intervention condition is equivalent in terms of contact time and in terms of number and type of contacts (each participant receives two group sessions, two individual sessions, two community-building sessions, and two follow-up ""booster"" sessions over four months). Respondent-driven sampling will be used to recruit and enroll 280 participants across two rural, predominantly African-American counties in the Arkansas Delta region to one of the two intervention conditions. The primary outcome variables will include condom use skills, sexual negotiation skills, and self-reported risk behaviors. Additional measures, including self-efficacy for decreased sexual risk, perceived peer norms for sexual risk, perceived benefits and barriers of sexual risk reduction, social support and social trust, mental health status, partner violence, and substance use, will also be collected to assess their theory-based mediating and moderating influences on the sexual risk skills and behaviors. Assessments will be conducted prior to the intervention, immediately post-intervention, and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. This project brings together a strong, experienced investigative team which has an established, trusting relationship with the community that will be involved in the study.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The project not only will provide critically-needed information about the efficacy of tailored behavioral interventions among rural African-Americans at high risk for HIV/STIs, but also will allow the study team to investigate important methodological questions about the use of respondent- driven sampling approaches in rural settings and about intraclass correlation coefficients for sexual risk measures in tight-knit rural communities. This research can thus make important contributions that address racial disparities in HIV/STIs, provide approaches for slowing the rapid growth of the epidemics in rural areas, and inform methodological innovations of importance to sexual risk reduction science.          ",Reducing Sexual Risk Behaviors among Rural African-American Cocaine Users,7417379,R01DA024575,"['design ', '

"PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative (MARI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Rates of HIV infection are increasing among heterosexual young adult Black men. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advancing HIV prevention agenda calls for intervention through voluntary counseling and testing. However, young adults are less likely to be tested for HIV than older age groups and there are still large numbers of Black heterosexual men who do not get HIV tested. A goal of the study is to build HIV prevention research capacity in Black communities in which little research has been conducted. We will conduct qualitative interviews with 20 low income heterosexual young adult Black (non-Hispanic) men (ages 18-25 years) to examine barriers and facilitators to HIV testing and elicit their opinions of how to promote HIV testing among their peers. Based on the results from the qualitative interviews, a questionnaire will be developed to identify attitudes towards HIV testing, perceptions of HIV risk, socio-cultural influences (e.g., incarceration history, and male gender norms), and their relationship to HIV testing behaviors among low income heterosexual young adult Black men. Results from both the qualitative interviews and survey will be used to develop tailored educational materials that promote HIV testing among low income young adult heterosexual Black men. Three focus groups will then be conducted with low income heterosexual young adult men to evaluate the acceptability of the materials. Findings will increase our understanding of factors that influence HIV testing among Black heterosexual young adult men. In addition, HIV testing promotion materials developed through this study may have utility in increasing the number of heterosexual Black young adult men who get tested and therefore become aware of their HIV status. This proposal seeks to identify factors that influence HIV testing among low income heterosexual young adult Black men. The study will also develop tailored educational materials to promote HIV testing among this population. Specifically tailoring HIV testing messages for low income heterosexual young adult Black men may have utility in increasing the numbers among this population who get tested and therefore become aware of their HIV status. Therefore, this information may make a significant contribution to HIV prevention efforts and addresses a public health priority that fits with the goals of the US Department of Health and Human Services Healthy People 2010 initiative to eliminate health disparities related to HIV.           ","PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative (MARI)",7393015,U01PS000676,[''],NCHHSTP,SUNY DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2007,155604,0.03581922130715391
"High-Risk Heterosexual Partnering in the Age of AIDS: A Multilevel Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Concurrent partnerships speed transmission of HIV through sexual networks much more effectively than does serial monogamy with the same total number of sexual partners. The social and economic environment in which many African Americans live discourages long-term monogamy and promotes concurrent partnerships. Extensive involvement in concurrency may be a key factor in the epidemics of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among African Americans. We propose the following hypotheses: (1) African American men and women are more likely than white men and women to have had heterosexual concurrent partnerships during the preceding 12 months. (2)Involvement in concurrent partnerships is related to lower community sex ratio, education, and marriage rates, and to higher unemployment, poverty and crime rates. These adverse social and economic conditions will largely account for the racial difference in concurrency. We will test these hypotheses through multilevel analyses in the over 12,000 men and women who participated in the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth. We will compare dates of first and last sexual intercourse with each of up to three partners in the past year, to identify concurrent partnerships. Data analyses will examine racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence, characteristics, and extent of involvement in concurrent partnerships among men and women. Stratified and multiple logistic regression analyses will investigate associations with individual-level variables (e.g., sexual history, marital status, and socioeconomic indicators) and, through multilevel analyses, with aspects of the social and economic environment. The study constitutes an important first step in development of future intervention studies and policies to effectively decrease the racial disparity in HIV infection rates.           ",High-Risk Heterosexual Partnering in the Age of AIDS: A Multilevel Analysis,7229331,R21HD054293,"['Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Institutional Practice ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' handicapping condition ', ' handicapping ', ' Infirmity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' African ', ' Logistics ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Marital Status ', ' Marriage ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Neighborhoods ', ' Respondent ', ' Poverty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sex Ratio ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Social Disorganizations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Woman ', ' Pattern ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' American ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Speed ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' mate ', ' Elevation ', ' social ', ' Institutional Policy ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Coitus ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' Crime ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2007,216939,0.06712038101756346
"Gender Identity and HIV Risk II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a revised submission for a 5-year competitive continuation to grant 1R01-DA015269, Gender Identity and HIV Risk. The long-range goal of our research is to reduce HIV transmission among individuals stigmatized for their gender nonconformity and diversity, a goal consistent with the Healthy People 2010 objective to reduce the nation's health disparities. Key findings from our prior work were: a) a national sample of these individuals can be effectively reached via the Internet; b) differences in sex, gender identity/role, and sexual orientation are associated with important differences in HIV risk behavior; c) individuals in the female role are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection through the high risk behavior of the men with whom they interact. We propose to build on these findings by investigating the HIV risk behavior and cofactors of this population's high risk male partners (N=400), using online survey and interview methods successfully applied in the original project (Aim 1). These results will help inform the development of a theory- driven, Internet-based, HIV prevention intervention for individuals who are stigmatized for their gender non- conformity (Aim 2). The intervention will be modeled on an offline HIV intervention shown, in an uncontrolled trial, to reduce risk behavior in the target population. After user-testing and refinement of the prototype online intervention, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial (N=600) to evaluate its efficacy in improving health and reducing HIV risk behavior (Aim 3). This study is innovative in that a) few interventions exist for this minority population and even fewer have been adequately evaluated; b) the intervention will combine HIV prevention and behavior change theories with principles of e-learning; c) the entire study will be implemented online. Our team is highly experienced in HIV prevention research with diverse and vulnerable populations, the benefits/challenges of Internet-based research (online recruitment, data collection, intervention adaptation), and sexual health theory and measures. The project has public health significance in that the minority population targeted for intervention is at high risk for HIV infection, and the men with whom they interact not only pose a risk to them, but also to the general population. If proven effective, the online intervention can be implemented with little additional cost to reduce gender-related HIV risks on a large scale, nationally and internationally, even among highly stigmatized groups.           ",Gender Identity and HIV Risk II,7228732,R01HD057595,"['Data Collection ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Data ', ' Range ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Female ', ' Prevention education ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' base ', ' cofactor ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Learning ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Rural ', ' satisfaction ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Respondent ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Play ', ' Companions ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' instrument ', ' Condition ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' self esteem ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Silicones ', ' Stigmata ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' transgender ', ' transsexual ', ' Body Image ', ' body perception ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' high risk behavior ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Role "", ' Female Roles ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' safer sex ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' prototype ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2007,737045,0.012674160682738618
"The impact of incarceration on partner selection norms and HIV    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Half of new HIV infections in the United States are among African-Americans. After decades of research focused on individual factors, investigators have concluded that individual behaviors are insufficient to explain the racial disparity in HIV rates. As a result, researchers have turned to focus on social factors that influence HIV risk behaviors. Incarceration is one such factor that disproportionately affects the health of African American individuals, families, and communities, and is associated with HIV infection. Multiple theories have been proposed about the association between incarceration rates and HIV rates. To test one proposed explanation for the association, the applicant will conduct a community-based survey in African American communities in Baltimore, Maryland. More than half of young African-American men in Baltimore are incarcerated or otherwise involved in the criminal justice system, and the metropolitan area has the fifth highest HIV rate in the nation. The incarceration of African-American males makes male partners scarce, and concurrent sexual partnerships with multiple females may become normal for many men. The perception that few male partners are available may promote the belief that men have more power than women in sexual relationships, resulting in less condom use and HIV infection. The study specifically aims to: 1) develop and validate scales to measure social norms about engaging in concurrent sexual partnerships; 2) assess whether psychosocial factors (norms about concurrent partnerships, perception of partner availability, and relationship power) are associated with behavioral risk factors for HIV, such as condom use and concurrent sexual partnerships; and 3 )assess whether these psychosocial factors explain the relationship between incarceration and HIV infection. Male and female adults will be recruited from high- poverty, high-AIDS prevalence areas in Baltimore as part of the CDC National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System study of heterosexuals at high risk of HIV infection. Participants will be tested for HIV, and a standardized questionnaire will collect information from 750 participants about sexual activity, drug use, incarceration status, and other behavioral and partner characteristics. The scale measuring social norms about engaging in concurrent sexual partnerships will be developed in a pilot study in the Baltimore City STD Clinics. National research priorities support research dedicated to understanding the social context of sexual risk behaviors. Identifying how social factors can impact HIV rates will allow for prevention programs that can alter the social environment and ultimately individual HIV risk.           ",The impact of incarceration on partner selection norms and HIV,7285032,F31MH080625,"['Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Support of Research ', ' Female ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Link ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Literature ', ' Inequality ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' male ', ' Maryland ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' tool ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' behavior change ', ' metropolitan ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' social ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' theories ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Prevalence ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2007,40972,0.0763610182932917
"Reducing HIV Heterosexual Risk Among African-American Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A large gap exists between the prevention needs of African-American, heterosexual men and the number and quality of programs demonstrated to meet these needs. Men who identify or are classified as Black are at increased risk, as compared to other racial/ethnic groups, for HIV infection acquired through heterosexual risk behavior. An important challenge is to design effective, sustainable programs that have potential to target this population and that can address multiple levels of factors that impact HIV-related behaviors. The barbershop setting is one venue that has significant promise as a vehicle for delivery of such programs, as this setting is widely and frequently used, has potential to build upon extant and trusting relationships, and can help promote a normative environment in support of behavior change. Investigators at SUNY Downstate Medical Center and the Arthur Ashe Institute of Urban Health, Inc. will build on their success in developing, implementing, and evaluating health promotion activities administered in community settings such as hair salons and barbershops by developing a program that will reach heterosexual men in barbershops serving communities with high HIV morbidity and AIDS- related mortality. We propose to: (1) Develop a steering committee consisting of key community stakeholders, representatives from organizations comprising our existing community partnerships, program investigators, and other key informants, (2) Conduct qualitative and quantiative formative evaluation to describe key individual and contextual level factors related to risk behavior in this population, and (3) design, implement, and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a theory-based behavioral intervention to reduce the burden of HIV. This three- year program will focus on development of the relationships, resources, infrastructure, and preliminary data necessary to implement and evaluate full-scale intervention programs designed to address these issues. This program seeks to design a community-based HIV prevention program that meets the needs of African American heterosexual men. As such, this proposal will meet a priority need as identified by our community, seek to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in disease as evidenced by epidemiologic data, and address the Healthy People 2010 overall goals to ""Prevent human immunodeficiency virus infection and its related illness and death"" and to ""Promote responsible sexual behaviors, strengthen community capacity, and increase access to quality services to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and their complications.""           ",Reducing HIV Heterosexual Risk Among African-American Men,7393024,UR6PS000691,[''],NCHHSTP,SUNY DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER,UR6,2007,228620,0.04135482605528618
"Reducing sexual risk among African American heterosexual men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Abstract The purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test a novel group-level intervention to reduce sexual risk behavior and increase HIV testing among heterosexually active African American men. Heterosexually active men have been called the ""forgotten group"" in HIV prevention, with the bulk of interventions focusing on women or other groups at high risk of HIV. In the United States, heterosexual contact is currently the second highest mode of HIV acquisition and African Americans are over-represented among these cases. New York City is the metropolitan area with the largest number of AIDS cases among African American men attributed to heterosexual contact. We propose a mixed-method study among adult heterosexually active African American men living in high prevalence neighborhoods with the aims to: 1) explore through in-depth qualitative interviews and focus groups personal, behavioral, and socio-structural factors that affect HIV sexual risk behavior and HIV testing rates, and participant perspectives on intervention characteristics; 2) develop and pilot test the intervention; and 3) estimate the efficacy of the intervention on reducing sexual risk behaviors and increasing HIV testing. To achieve these aims, we propose to conduct 6 focus groups and 50 in-depth interviews to elicit: (a) descriptions and reflections on personal, behavioral and socio-structural factors that impact on HIV sexual risk behavior and HIV testing. These factors will be examined from a general perspective and through questions that elicit descriptions, reflections, and comparisons of past sexual risk events, both high and low risk, and the factors affecting the course of those events; (b) participant perspectives on intervention characteristics that may effectively lead to reductions in high risk behavior and increases in HIV testing. We will then develop and pilot test a multi-session group-level intervention informed by the findings of our formative research, and pilot test the interview instrument. In the last phase, we will conduct a pre-post test study by enrolling 50 heterosexually active African American men at risk of HIV infection into the intervention. At baseline and 3 months, standardized data collection using audio computer assisted self-interviewing technology will assess outcomes and covariates. The primary outcomes for the estimating efficacy will be the occurrence of unprotected vaginal intercourse and/or unprotected anal intercourse with female partners and concurrent partnering with female and/or male partners. Secondary outcomes will include occurrence of HIV testing and number of new and total female and male sex partners. The results of this proposed project will be used to estimate sample size or effect size for scaling up to a randomized controlled trial. The heterosexual HIV epidemic is a growing public health problem in the United States. African Americans are over-represented among these cases, contributing to the growing health disparities that characterize the HIV epidemic in the US. This study will develop and test a behavioral intervention to reduce sexual risk and increase HIV testing among heterosexually active African American men.           ",Reducing sexual risk among African American heterosexual men,7392598,UR6PS000667,[''],NCHHSTP,NEW YORK BLOOD CENTER,UR6,2007,223796,0.08297852110161062
"Woman Focused HIV Prevention with African-Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised competing continuation proposes to examine the long-term effects of the Women's CoOp intervention funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). HIV surveillance indicates that underclass African-Americans in the South continue to be at high risk for HIV and face significant health disparities through poverty, unemployment, and homelessness. Intervention research has demonstrated that HIV is preventable through safer drug and sexual practices, and that HIV risk behaviors can and do change. However, African-American women who live in poverty experience unique social contexts that affect HIV risk. These contexts need to be addressed in sustaining HIV risk reduction. The Women's CoOp study has demonstrated that a gender-based, individualized HIV prevention intervention with inner-city African-American women who use crack cocaine is effective in reducing HIV risk behaviors and empowering these women to begin to change their social contexts of employment and homelessness. These findings suggest that the women who were able to positively change their social contexts by becoming employed or finding homes had greater reductions in sexual risk for HIV than those who remained unemployed or homeless. However, it is not known if these risk-reduction behaviors can be sustained over time. Many African-American women who live in high-risk communities face environmental stressors that may facilitate relapse to drug and sexual risk behaviors. The next empirical question for the Women's CoOp study is to determine the long-term effects of the Woman-Focused intervention with regard to drug and sexual risk for HIV, self-sufficiency, and a woman's ability to sustain change within her social context. Further, we posit that briefer interventions at regular intervals will be more effective in sustaining behavior change and be more cost-effective. The specific aims of the proposed study are as follows: Aim 1. To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of a culturally specific, woman-focused intervention relative to the NIDA standard intervention in terms of crack use and sexual risk behaviors and self-sufficiency (e.g., employment, housing). Aim 2. To compare the effectiveness of a culturally specific, woman-focused booster follow-up intervention--relative to the NIDA standard booster follow-up intervention offered biannually--to sustain reductions in crack use and sexual risk and improve self-sufficiency at 6, 12, and 18 months post reenrollment among Women's CoOp participants. Aim 3. To examine the mediating effects of employment and housing, as well as moderators, such as age, abuse history and psychological distress, on the effectiveness of the intervention at changing HIV risk behaviors at 6, 12, and 18 months post reenrollment. Aim 4. To estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of a culturally specific, woman-focused intervention relative to the NIDA standard in terms of crack use and sexual risk behaviors.

"Computer-Based HIV Prevention for African-American Women PROJECT SUMMARY: While the overall HIV infection rates in the US have been remained relatively constant, disparities in rates between Whites and members of other racial/ethnic groups continue to grow. Several behavioral prevention interventions tailored for African-Americans have shown efficacy in reducing sexual risk behaviors. However, their successful replication has been hampered by cost, implementation difficulties, and participant retention issues. The proposed project seeks to address these barriers to reducing HIV/AIDS rates by developing and empirically validating research-based, computerized versions of efficacious in-person HIV programs for African-American females, and making these computerized programs accessible to service provision agencies at low cost via CD-ROM and the Internet. Specific objectives include: (1) to increase service agencies' ability to implement efficacious HIV interventions with fidelity; (2) to increase African-American females' participation in efficacious HIV interventions; and (3) to ultimately, to reduce sexual risk behaviors and HIV infection rates among African-American females. In Phase I we will: (a) develop a computer-based version of SiSTA, an in-person, group-administered HIV prevention program for young African-American women that has demonstrated efficacy in reducing sexual risk behavior; and (b) validate computer-based SiSTA (""Digitized SiSTA"") through a randomized controlled trial in which Digitized SiSTA's effects are compared to those of group-administered SiSTA (""Group SiSTA""). Digitized SiSTA will be developed in collaboration with Group SiSTA's developers, who will be project Co-Investigators, and it will be informed by focus groups and pilot testing with the target population. If Phase I is successful, in Phase II we will develop and validate computer-based versions of other efficacious group programs for African-American females. RELEVANCE: The proposed research will make proven-effective HIV prevention programs for African-American women available to health service organizations at low cost and will facilitate their cost-effective implementation. It will also promote community members' participation in the interventios by permitting sensitive topics to be addressed privately (i.e., one-on-one with the computer) and according to a flexible schedule. Ultimately, it will help to reduce sexual risk-taking behavior and HIV infection rates among African-American girls and women, who are disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

"Keep It Up: Peak Performance for Life HIV Intervention for African American Males    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Education Development Center, Inc. and Medgar Evers College of the City University of New York will develop and pilot test the Keep It Up: Peak Performance for Life program targeted to African American and other Black young men in high-poverty communities where HIV, other sexually transmitted infections (STI), substance use and unintentional pregnancies are elevated. This integrated structural, community, and individual-level intervention embeds HIV behavioral prevention and testing within a comprehensive social marketing and health screening program. This ground-breaking intervention incorporates four core elements: (1) Culturally tailored and male-targeted social marketing campaign to raise awareness about sexual health and the Keep It Up: Peak Performance for Life program; (2) Sexual and general health screening that includes simple, relatively non-invasive biologic testing for HIV, as well hypertension, cholesterol, diabetes, lung function and other STI, which are related to longer-term chronic diseases and sexual dysfunction; (3) Brief, engaging computerized HIV behavioral risk reduction that uses video clips and interactive activities to trigger self-assessment of risk, increase motivation for safer behaviors and relationships, model condom use and negotiation skills, and provide normative support; and (4) Personalized health profile and HIV risk reduction plan. Keep It Up seeks to ""normalize"" HIV prevention and testing in the context of a convenient, relatively non-invasive health check-up for men, similar to routine reproductive health care provided to women. The specific aims are to: 1. Conduct formative research to refine the core elements and content of the Keep It Up: Peak Performance for Life health promotion program for African American and other Black young men; 2. Finalize the Keep It Up: Peak Performance for Life core elements and materials; 3. Collaborate with the CDC multi-site committee to develop evaluation materials that can be used across sites to provide preliminary evidence of whether the intervention leads to change in HIV risk behaviors; 4. Pilot the intervention and enroll a sample of about 100 African American and other Black young men in a repeated-measures pre-post test with a 3-month follow up to determine whether the approach is promising and merits further evaluation. Keep It Up is designed for young men to receive HIV behavioral prevention and HIV testing quickly and conveniently in a non-threatening and non-stigmatized community setting. In addition to HIV prevention, the goal is to market health promotion to a population of African American men who bear a disproportionate burden of not only HIV/AIDS but other chronic conditions that lead to ongoing health disparities.              ",Keep It Up: Peak Performance for Life HIV Intervention for African American Males,7284203,UR6PS000399,[''],NCHHSTP,"EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT CENTER, INC.",UR6,2007,288117,0.04856405655692342
"HIV Risk among Male Parolees and their Female Partners    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects prisoners in the United States. Women of color and low-income women in the United States also have disproportionately high rates of HIV infection and AIDS diagnosis. Recent studies have shown that racial disparities in incarceration can be linked to health disparities, including disparities in HIV/AIDS. Research exploring how the disproportionate levels of HIV/AIDS among incarcerated men and among low-income women of color are related is crucial. The proposed study will be conducted with both members of male-female couples in which the male partner was recently released from prison and is under parole supervision (""male parolees""). The specific aims of the proposed study are: 1) Using quantitative methods, we will assess the HIV-risk behaviors of each member of the couple and identify individual-level and couple-level psychosocial influences on HIV risk and risk reduction; 2) Using qualitative methods, we will describe the unique influence of the context of a man's incarceration on couples' decision-making processes involving HIV risk and risk reduction; 3) Using quantitative and qualitative methods, we will investigate how males' and females' perspectives on HIV risk and risk reduction influence both their own behavior and behavior within the couple. Our preliminary studies have underscored the complexities of understanding how the context of a man's incarceration influences couples' decision-making processes involving HIV risk and risk reduction and have compelled us to undertake couple-level research on this issue. Public-health researchers have identified the necessity of developing and providing population-specific HIV interventions and services for people affected by incarceration both in prison and in their home neighborhoods post-release. The proposed research will yield critical information about HIV risk and risk reduction in dyadic relationships between male parolees and their female partners that can be used to develop population-appropriate and effective interventions for the millions of low-income people of color who experience their own or their partner's incarceration each year.           ",HIV Risk among Male Parolees and their Female Partners,7283451,R01MH078743,"['Couples ', ' Decision Making ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Dreams ', ' dreaming ', ' Low income ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Social Aspects of Cancer ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Left ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Link ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Gender Relations ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Prisoner ', ' jail inmate ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' Prisons ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' programs ', ' Supervision ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' information gathering ', ' experience ', ' AIDS diagnosis ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' parolee ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' parole ', ' Emotional ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Color ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' service intervention ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2007,489691,0.02642058589971276
"Understanding & Empowering Women's Health Negotiations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young women, particularly women of color, are at increasing risk from HIV in the United States today. Prevention efforts focused on increasing consistent condom use have had limited success. Gendered sexual roles that limit female power in safer sex negotiations have been suggested as a possible influence, but little empirical work has been done in this promising area. There is a shortage of research on factors that empower women to negotiate safer sex with male partners and influences on their ability to do so successfully.

"Trajectories and Consequences of Nonmarital Fathering    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this project is to investigate the factors associated with men becoming unwed fathers and the nature and consequences of unmarried fathers' involvement with children. This is an important topic, given the large and growing number of men who will have at least one child outside of marriage and the large fraction of children and mothers who will be exposed to their fathering behavior. Yet, our knowledge about nonmarital fathering and how it affects partners, children, and the fathers themselves remains limited, in part because men are often under-represented in national surveys. Fathers represent an important resource for children, ideally investing the time, money and emotion that promote healthy child development and socialization, but unwed fathers often have individual and contextual characteristics that deter and complicate their potential for positive involvement in family life; these include low human capital, high rates of social-behavioral problems, and a high likelihood of living away from their child, as well as three important but little explored factors related to nonmarital fathering fathers' ongoing relationships with mothers (whether romantic and/or co-parenting), the fact that unmarried men (and women) often have children by multiple partners (so-called `multi-partnered fertility'), and the fact that a non-trivial number of unwed fathers have been or will be incarcerated. Using three national datasets (the National Survey of Family Growth, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, and the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study), this research will provide new information about the trajectories and consequences of recent and contemporary nonmarital fathering. The study includes three specific aims: 1) To evaluate the antecedents of nonmarital fatherhood and the effects of becoming an unwed father on the male life course; 2) To analyze the nature and dynamics of unwed fathers' involvement in families as partners and parents, especially as linked to relationships with mothers, multi-partnered fertility, and paternal incarceration; and 3) To examine the consequences of unmarried fathers' involvement for the wellbeing of children and of fathers themselves, including whether the benefits are moderated by fathers' characteristics or context. Using a life course perspective and drawing on family systems theory, this project will evaluate key stages and turning points in men becoming and then being unmarried fathers, including factors that both enhance and deter positive parenting over time. The study will explore race/ethnic differences in unwed fathering and consider key analytic challenges related to social selection and missing data. Overall, this study will provide new information about the process, content, and consequences of nonmarital fathering for children and families and may shed light on the development of sound policies and programs to strengthen families. PUBLIC HELATH RELEVANCE This study will provide new information about the factors associated with men becoming unwed fathers and the nature and consequences of unmarried fathers' involvement with children. Given the rising fraction of births that occur outside of marriage and the negative consequences of father absence for children, this study will provide information to aid the development of sound policies and programs to keep fathers connected to children and to strengthen families across diverse contexts.             ",Trajectories and Consequences of Nonmarital Fathering,7533167,R01HD057894,"['Demography ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Provider ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Economics ', ' Emotions ', ' Employment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Rate ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Investments ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' male ', ' Marriage ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Mothers ', ' Multiple Partners ', ' Parents ', ' Staging ', ' fatherhood ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Socialization ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' sound ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Systems Theory ', ' Time ', ' Unmarried Father ', ' Woman ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' father role ', ' paternity ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Today ', ' Generations ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Unmarried ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' nonmarital childbearing ', ' premarital childbearing ', ' human capital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' child bearing ', ' childbearing ', ' bearing children ', ' bear children ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Fertility ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' partner violence ', ' violent partner ', ' problem, partner, abuse, violent ', ' Affect ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2008,157781,0.0426578223555679
"Reducing HIV Disparities: Sexual Concurrency Communication for HIV Prevention amo    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on different racial/ethnic groups remains one of the most extreme examples of a racial disparity in health among Americans. HIV infection is significantly higher among non-Hispanic blacks than among any other racial/ethnic group in the United States. There is now evidence that sexual network dynamics, including overlapping sexual partnerships (concurrency) play an important role in racial disparities in HIV. Due to structural factors, including highly disproportionate incarceration rates, African- Americans are more likely to be in sexual networks where people have more concurrent sexual partners. Mathematical models show that achieving very small reductions in levels of sexual concurrency can have a dramatic impact on the chain of HIV transmission. Our Community Action Board (CAB) of the Center for AIDS & STD Working Group on Disparities has prioritized developing health communication messages about sexual networks to help reduce HIV stigma and transmission in communities of African heritage. In this research, we will utilize community-based participatory research methods to translate the science of sexual networks into culturally-resonant HIV prevention messages as a new approach to help reduce racial disparities in HIV. Aim 1: Undertake formative research to develop HIV prevention messages that convey the importance of sexual network dynamics in King County, Washington. The CAB Disparities Working Group will conduct focus groups and interviews with a) native-born African-Americans and b) foreign-born blacks (Ethiopian and Kenyan immigrants, who are the majority of incident HIV among foreign-born blacks in King County). We will develop a multimedia tool in English, Kiswahili, and Amharic illustrating principles of HIV transmission in sexual networks for use in community discussions. We will identify sexual network message dissemination channels in the target populations including social network approaches (person-to-person communication), civil society approaches (faith-based organizations, community events and organizations), and the media. Subaim 2.1.1. We will continue to inform ourselves about best practices in community-participatory research via seminars and discussions. Aim 2: Pilot and evaluate the impact of the HIV prevention concurrency messages among populations of African-Americans and African-born populations in King County. The CAB Disparities Working Group will launch HIV prevention concurrency messaging and evaluate acceptability and impact, including message comprehension and recall (1-month post recall among n=30 African-Americans and n=30 Kenyans and Ethiopians), intention, and attitude strength. The CAB Working Group will develop and implement a manual of community-based research translation processes used including community outreach, HIV prevention message development, and message dissemination in affected communities. Subaim  2.2.1. We will build capacity by educating ourselves about cutting edge approaches to development and marketing of health messages. Aim 3: HIV disparity message findings and tools will be shared in a national seminar. We will invite the national Center for AIDS Research network and their CABs to a national meeting, where we will also explore the feasibility of a community-collaborative multi-site randomized controlled trial assessing impact of a sexual concurrency intervention for HIV prevention in areas with large populations of African- Americans and African immigrants. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study addresses the critical and persistent disparity in HIV among persons of African heritage. A novel sexual network approach that translates new scientific understanding into culturally-resonant prevention messages delivered within a community-participatory framework has the potential to be implemented for other similar populations across the US.          ",Reducing HIV Disparities: Sexual Concurrency Communication for HIV Prevention amo,7425134,R21HD057832,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Radio ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Social Network ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Translation Process ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Rate ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Comprehension ', ' Intention ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Information Networks ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' insight ', ' African ', ' Manuals ', ' Marketing ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Persons ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Play ', ' Printing ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Societies ', ' Stigmata ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' animation ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Attitude ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Washington ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Event ', ' Church ', ' American ', ' condoms ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' County ', ' Native-Born ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Actions ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Population ', ' Abstinence ', ' community organizations ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2008,199773,0.013963834637251878
"Reducing sexual risk among African American heterosexual men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Abstract The purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test a novel group-level intervention to reduce sexual risk behavior and increase HIV testing among heterosexually active African American men. Heterosexually active men have been called the ""forgotten group"" in HIV prevention, with the bulk of interventions focusing on women or other groups at high risk of HIV. In the United States, heterosexual contact is currently the second highest mode of HIV acquisition and African Americans are over-represented among these cases. New York City is the metropolitan area with the largest number of AIDS cases among African American men attributed to heterosexual contact. We propose a mixed-method study among adult heterosexually active African American men living in high prevalence neighborhoods with the aims to: 1) explore through in-depth qualitative interviews and focus groups personal, behavioral, and socio-structural factors that affect HIV sexual risk behavior and HIV testing rates, and participant perspectives on intervention characteristics; 2) develop and pilot test the intervention; and 3) estimate the efficacy of the intervention on reducing sexual risk behaviors and increasing HIV testing. To achieve these aims, we propose to conduct 6 focus groups and 50 in-depth interviews to elicit: (a) descriptions and reflections on personal, behavioral and socio-structural factors that impact on HIV sexual risk behavior and HIV testing. These factors will be examined from a general perspective and through questions that elicit descriptions, reflections, and comparisons of past sexual risk events, both high and low risk, and the factors affecting the course of those events; (b) participant perspectives on intervention characteristics that may effectively lead to reductions in high risk behavior and increases in HIV testing. We will then develop and pilot test a multi-session group-level intervention informed by the findings of our formative research, and pilot test the interview instrument. In the last phase, we will conduct a pre-post test study by enrolling 50 heterosexually active African American men at risk of HIV infection into the intervention. At baseline and 3 months, standardized data collection using audio computer assisted self-interviewing technology will assess outcomes and covariates. The primary outcomes for the estimating efficacy will be the occurrence of unprotected vaginal intercourse and/or unprotected anal intercourse with female partners and concurrent partnering with female and/or male partners. Secondary outcomes will include occurrence of HIV testing and number of new and total female and male sex partners. The results of this proposed project will be used to estimate sample size or effect size for scaling up to a randomized controlled trial. The heterosexual HIV epidemic is a growing public health problem in the United States. African Americans are over-represented among these cases, contributing to the growing health disparities that characterize the HIV epidemic in the US. This study will develop and test a behavioral intervention to reduce sexual risk and increase HIV testing among heterosexually active African American men.           ",Reducing sexual risk among African American heterosexual men,7491090,UR6PS000667,[''],NCHHSTP,NEW YORK BLOOD CENTER,UR6,2008,370368,0.08297852110161062
"African American Young Mens Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised application is being resubmitted in response to the National Institutes of Health's Program Announcement entitled, ""Health Disparities in HIV/AIDS: Focus on African Americans"" (PA-06-069, reissued as PA-07-116), which recognizes that ""African Americans [represent] a group that has experienced exceptionally high rates of new HIV infections and worse survival rates than other ethnic/racial groups in this country."" To be sure, as we are now in the third decade of the HIV epidemic, African American men who have sex with men remain disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the US. Perhaps the most hidden segment of this population are African American young men who have sex with men (AAYMSM), who now represent the largest proportion of new infections among men who have sex with men (MSM). Though HIV prevention efforts using bar settings or community-based organizations targeting the gay community have been met with success, research indicates that many at-risk AAYMSM do not frequent these venues. Instead, large numbers of AAYMSM can be reached through the Ball and House communities. The Ball community revolves around collectives called ""Houses,"" which are racial, ethnic, and sexual minority defined communities that are characterized by groups of young men who create a family structure with an appointed ""mother,"" ""father"" and other members called ""the children."" The Houses offer members a network of friends and a place to turn to for support, positive affirming norms, collective identity, and connectedness among AAYMSM. Often young men join a House after having been rejected by their own family. The Balls, which are held several times a month, are lavish celebrations/competitions that serve as a social event for MSM of color, particularly AAYMSM. Our own research suggests that the Ball and House communities could be ideal settings in which to conduct HIV prevention research with AAYMSM. We are therefore proposing to conduct ethnographic and survey research to better understand and examine: 1) the structural, social, and cultural characteristics of the Ball and House communities; 2) Ball and House members' use of illicit drugs and involvement in HIV risk and protective behaviors, and their social and sexual networks; and 3) the role that rejection, discrimination, and internalized homophobia play with respect to encouraging drug use and HIV risk.

This application proposes to fill this gap by investigating the influences of gender norms and gender inequality, as enacted through female sexual agency, on women's safer sex negotiations, using a mixed methods design.              ",Understanding & Empowering Women's Health Negotiations,7496412,F31MH078732,"['Risk Reduction ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Data ', ' NIH Office of AIDS Research ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' sex ', ' Fellowship ', ' Female ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Affect ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Goals ', ' Guilt ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Area ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Names ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Respondent ', ' Play ', ' Sister ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Religion ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexuality ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' Victimization ', ' Testing ', ' Assertiveness ', ' United States ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Dimensions ', ' Behavior ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' interest ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' success ', ' condoms ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Today ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Regulation ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' desire ', ' theories ', ' Color ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' safer sex ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2008,32826,0.05250745091106501
"PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative (MARI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Rates of HIV infection are increasing among heterosexual young adult Black men. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advancing HIV prevention agenda calls for intervention through voluntary counseling and testing. However, young adults are less likely to be tested for HIV than older age groups and there are still large numbers of Black heterosexual men who do not get HIV tested. A goal of the study is to build HIV prevention research capacity in Black communities in which little research has been conducted. We will conduct qualitative interviews with 20 low income heterosexual young adult Black (non-Hispanic) men (ages 18-25 years) to examine barriers and facilitators to HIV testing and elicit their opinions of how to promote HIV testing among their peers. Based on the results from the qualitative interviews, a questionnaire will be developed to identify attitudes towards HIV testing, perceptions of HIV risk, socio-cultural influences (e.g., incarceration history, and male gender norms), and their relationship to HIV testing behaviors among low income heterosexual young adult Black men. Results from both the qualitative interviews and survey will be used to develop tailored educational materials that promote HIV testing among low income young adult heterosexual Black men. Three focus groups will then be conducted with low income heterosexual young adult men to evaluate the acceptability of the materials. Findings will increase our understanding of factors that influence HIV testing among Black heterosexual young adult men. In addition, HIV testing promotion materials developed through this study may have utility in increasing the number of heterosexual Black young adult men who get tested and therefore become aware of their HIV status. This proposal seeks to identify factors that influence HIV testing among low income heterosexual young adult Black men. The study will also develop tailored educational materials to promote HIV testing among this population. Specifically tailoring HIV testing messages for low income heterosexual young adult Black men may have utility in increasing the numbers among this population who get tested and therefore become aware of their HIV status. Therefore, this information may make a significant contribution to HIV prevention efforts and addresses a public health priority that fits with the goals of the US Department of Health and Human Services Healthy People 2010 initiative to eliminate health disparities related to HIV.           ","PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative (MARI)",7497073,U01PS000676,[''],NCHHSTP,ST.

"HIV Risk among Male Parolees and their Female Partners    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects prisoners in the United States. Women of color and low-income women in the United States also have disproportionately high rates of HIV infection and AIDS diagnosis. Recent studies have shown that racial disparities in incarceration can be linked to health disparities, including disparities in HIV/AIDS. Research exploring how the disproportionate levels of HIV/AIDS among incarcerated men and among low-income women of color are related is crucial. The proposed study will be conducted with both members of male-female couples in which the male partner was recently released from prison and is under parole supervision (""male parolees""). The specific aims of the proposed study are: 1) Using quantitative methods, we will assess the HIV-risk behaviors of each member of the couple and identify individual-level and couple-level psychosocial influences on HIV risk and risk reduction; 2) Using qualitative methods, we will describe the unique influence of the context of a man's incarceration on couples' decision-making processes involving HIV risk and risk reduction; 3) Using quantitative and qualitative methods, we will investigate how males' and females' perspectives on HIV risk and risk reduction influence both their own behavior and behavior within the couple. Our preliminary studies have underscored the complexities of understanding how the context of a man's incarceration influences couples' decision-making processes involving HIV risk and risk reduction and have compelled us to undertake couple-level research on this issue. Public-health researchers have identified the necessity of developing and providing population-specific HIV interventions and services for people affected by incarceration both in prison and in their home neighborhoods post-release. The proposed research will yield critical information about HIV risk and risk reduction in dyadic relationships between male parolees and their female partners that can be used to develop population-appropriate and effective interventions for the millions of low-income people of color who experience their own or their partner's incarceration each year.           ",HIV Risk among Male Parolees and their Female Partners,7455017,R01MH078743,"['Couples ', ' Decision Making ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Dreams ', ' dreaming ', ' Low income ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Social Aspects of Cancer ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Left ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Link ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Gender Relations ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Prisoner ', ' jail inmate ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' Prisons ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' programs ', ' Supervision ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' information gathering ', ' experience ', ' AIDS diagnosis ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' parolee ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' parole ', ' Emotional ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Color ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' service intervention ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2008,458160,0.02642058589971276
"Reducing Sexual Risk Behaviors among Rural African-American Cocaine Users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV and other sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates continue to rise disproportionately among African-Americans, and particularly dramatically among rural populations. Stimulant use, especially cocaine use, among rural African-Americans is also increasing, and is related to multiple risk behaviors for HIV/STI, including sex with multiple partners, exchanging sex for drugs and other commodities, and inconsistent condom use. Despite these documented risk patterns, and the increasing disparities in HIV/STI incidence, few theory-based interventions have been specifically designed and tested for rural African-American populations with high-risk behavioral patterns. The primary aims of this project are to adapt an existing risk reduction program to the needs of rural African-American cocaine users, to test the adapted intervention's efficacy via a behavioral clinical trial, and to answer outstanding questions regarding intraclass correlation and sampling methodologies in the sexual risk reduction literature. The project team will conduct a longitudinal intervention study with stratified group randomization, so that participants receive the sexual risk intervention or an active control intervention condition in groups. Each intervention condition is equivalent in terms of contact time and in terms of number and type of contacts (each participant receives two group sessions, two individual sessions, two community-building sessions, and two follow-up ""booster"" sessions over four months). Respondent-driven sampling will be used to recruit and enroll 280 participants across two rural, predominantly African-American counties in the Arkansas Delta region to one of the two intervention conditions. The primary outcome variables will include condom use skills, sexual negotiation skills, and self-reported risk behaviors. Additional measures, including self-efficacy for decreased sexual risk, perceived peer norms for sexual risk, perceived benefits and barriers of sexual risk reduction, social support and social trust, mental health status, partner violence, and substance use, will also be collected to assess their theory-based mediating and moderating influences on the sexual risk skills and behaviors. Assessments will be conducted prior to the intervention, immediately post-intervention, and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. This project brings together a strong, experienced investigative team which has an established, trusting relationship with the community that will be involved in the study.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The project not only will provide critically-needed information about the efficacy of tailored behavioral interventions among rural African-Americans at high risk for HIV/STIs, but also will allow the study team to investigate important methodological questions about the use of respondent- driven sampling approaches in rural settings and about intraclass correlation coefficients for sexual risk measures in tight-knit rural communities. This research can thus make important contributions that address racial disparities in HIV/STIs, provide approaches for slowing the rapid growth of the epidemics in rural areas, and inform methodological innovations of importance to sexual risk reduction science.          ",Reducing Sexual Risk Behaviors among Rural African-American Cocaine Users,7498930,R01DA024575,"['Risk Reduction

"High-Risk Heterosexual Partnering in the Age of AIDS: A Multilevel Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Concurrent partnerships speed transmission of HIV through sexual networks much more effectively than does serial monogamy with the same total number of sexual partners. The social and economic environment in which many African Americans live discourages long-term monogamy and promotes concurrent partnerships. Extensive involvement in concurrency may be a key factor in the epidemics of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among African Americans. We propose the following hypotheses: (1) African American men and women are more likely than white men and women to have had heterosexual concurrent partnerships during the preceding 12 months. (2)Involvement in concurrent partnerships is related to lower community sex ratio, education, and marriage rates, and to higher unemployment, poverty and crime rates. These adverse social and economic conditions will largely account for the racial difference in concurrency. We will test these hypotheses through multilevel analyses in the over 12,000 men and women who participated in the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth. We will compare dates of first and last sexual intercourse with each of up to three partners in the past year, to identify concurrent partnerships. Data analyses will examine racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence, characteristics, and extent of involvement in concurrent partnerships among men and women. Stratified and multiple logistic regression analyses will investigate associations with individual-level variables (e.g., sexual history, marital status, and socioeconomic indicators) and, through multilevel analyses, with aspects of the social and economic environment. The study constitutes an important first step in development of future intervention studies and policies to effectively decrease the racial disparity in HIV infection rates.           ",High-Risk Heterosexual Partnering in the Age of AIDS: A Multilevel Analysis,7409190,R21HD054293,"['Crime ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Institutional Practice ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' handicapping condition ', ' handicapping ', ' Infirmity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' African ', ' Logistics ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Marital Status ', ' Marriage ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Neighborhoods ', ' Respondent ', ' Poverty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sex Ratio ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Social Disorganizations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Woman ', ' Pattern ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' American ', ' Speed (motion) ', ' Speed ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' mate ', ' Elevation ', ' social ', ' Institutional Policy ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Coitus ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2008,176831,0.06712038101756346
"Encouraging Safe Dates: Reducing Intimate Partner Violence in South African Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  HIV prevalence rates in South Africa are among the highest in the world; transmission is largely heterosexual, and young people, especially young females, are disproportionately affected. It is increasingly understood that efforts to promote safer sexual practices in this vulnerable population may be undermined by high rates of intimate partner violence (IPV). Epidemiologic and ethnographic research among South African youth, much of it conducted by members of this research team, has provided data to support a model suggesting that ideologies of male superiority and cultural violence are manifested in gender inequality. In this setting, boys are encouraged to enforce the hierarchy, and to use violence to punish transgressions and stifle resultant conflicts. Girls receive little social support to protect them from such aggressive control. Alcohol and drug use are associated with higher levels of relationship conflict and a greater likelihood that violence will occur. High rates of rape and coerced sex are associated with early initiation of sex, failure to use condoms, and multiple, risky sexual partnerships, increasing risk of HIV transmission. Accordingly, it is proposed that an intervention be developed to reduce IPV among South African youth by: increasing social support for girls; questioning male norms of superiority, sexual entitlement, and control of girls; reducing alcohol and drug use; and improving communication to reduce the use of violence in resolving relationship conflicts. Efficacious interventions to delay sexual initiation, promote correct and consistent condom use, and discourage multiple risky sexual partnerships will also be integrated into the program. The intervention will be adapted from a school-based program, Safe Dates, which significantly reduced IPV among 8th and 9th grade students in the southeastern United States (Foshee, Bauman, Ennet, et al., 2004). It also will incorporate materials from two South African intervention programs, Our Times Our Choices (Drs. Zimmerman and Cupp) and Stepping Stones (Jewkes, Nduna & Jama 2002; Jewkes et al., 2007) which have shown significant effects on key outcomes. Specifically, we propose to: 1) Adapt Safe Dates for use as an intervention to reduce IPV among in- school South African adolescents and integrate interventions targeting HIV risk behavior; 2) Conduct a pilot study of the adapted Safe Dates program with in-school South African adolescents to: a) reduce IPV, the primary target of the intervention, and b) delay initiation of sex, increase condom use, decrease the number of sexual partners, and decrease risky sexual partnerships, the secondary targets of the intervention. The pilot study will employ an experimental design, a six-month follow-up period, and audio-enhanced personal digital assistants (APDAs) to optimize honest self-report. The primary goals of the proposed project are to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the adapted Safe Dates program in South Africa and to provide estimates of effect sizes, so that a randomized control trial can be designed to assess its efficacy.                ",Encouraging Safe Dates: Reducing Intimate Partner Violence in South African Youth,7421092,R34MH081792,"['Personal Digital Assistant ', ' Pocket Personal Computer ', ' Pocket PCs ', ' Personal Digital Assistant Computer ', ' Palmtop computer ', ' Palmtop ', ' Palm-top computer ', ' Palm-top ', ' Palm Pilot ', ' PDA Computer ', ' Blueberry Device ', ' BlackBerry Device ', ' Stifle joint ', ' Data ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Rate ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Female ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Language ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Numbers ', ' African ', ' Inequality ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' male ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Forcible intercourse ', ' Rape ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' South Africa ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' Southeast US ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' Arts ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' size ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' Calculi ', ' Stone ', ' Biliary or Urinary Stones ', ' condoms ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' early sex initiation ', ' initiation of intercourse ', ' early sexual initiation ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' ']",NIMH,PACIFIC INSTITUTE FOR RES AND EVALUATION,R34,2008,198307,-0.003309642672136005
"The impact of incarceration on partner selection norms and HIV    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Half of new HIV infections in the United States are among African-Americans. After decades of research focused on individual factors, investigators have concluded that individual behaviors are insufficient to explain the racial disparity in HIV rates. As a result, researchers have turned to focus on social factors that influence HIV risk behaviors. Incarceration is one such factor that disproportionately affects the health of African American individuals, families, and communities, and is associated with HIV infection. Multiple theories have been proposed about the association between incarceration rates and HIV rates. To test one proposed explanation for the association, the applicant will conduct a community-based survey in African American communities in Baltimore, Maryland. More than half of young African-American men in Baltimore are incarcerated or otherwise involved in the criminal justice system, and the metropolitan area has the fifth highest HIV rate in the nation. The incarceration of African-American males makes male partners scarce, and concurrent sexual partnerships with multiple females may become normal for many men. The perception that few male partners are available may promote the belief that men have more power than women in sexual relationships, resulting in less condom use and HIV infection. The study specifically aims to: 1) develop and validate scales to measure social norms about engaging in concurrent sexual partnerships; 2) assess whether psychosocial factors (norms about concurrent partnerships, perception of partner availability, and relationship power) are associated with behavioral risk factors for HIV, such as condom use and concurrent sexual partnerships; and 3 )assess whether these psychosocial factors explain the relationship between incarceration and HIV infection. Male and female adults will be recruited from high- poverty, high-AIDS prevalence areas in Baltimore as part of the CDC National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System study of heterosexuals at high risk of HIV infection. Participants will be tested for HIV, and a standardized questionnaire will collect information from 750 participants about sexual activity, drug use, incarceration status, and other behavioral and partner characteristics. The scale measuring social norms about engaging in concurrent sexual partnerships will be developed in a pilot study in the Baltimore City STD Clinics. National research priorities support research dedicated to understanding the social context of sexual risk behaviors. Identifying how social factors can impact HIV rates will allow for prevention programs that can alter the social environment and ultimately individual HIV risk.           ",The impact of incarceration on partner selection norms and HIV,7410125,F31MH080625,"['Woman ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' behavior change ', ' metropolitan ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' social ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' theories ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Prevalence ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Support of Research ', ' Female ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Link ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Literature ', ' Inequality ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' male ', ' Maryland ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' tool ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2008,40972,0.0763610182932917
"Gender Identity and HIV Risk II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a revised submission for a 5-year competitive continuation to grant 1R01-DA015269, Gender Identity and HIV Risk. The long-range goal of our research is to reduce HIV transmission among individuals stigmatized for their gender nonconformity and diversity, a goal consistent with the Healthy People 2010 objective to reduce the nation's health disparities. Key findings from our prior work were: a) a national sample of these individuals can be effectively reached via the Internet; b) differences in sex, gender identity/role, and sexual orientation are associated with important differences in HIV risk behavior; c) individuals in the female role are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection through the high risk behavior of the men with whom they interact. We propose to build on these findings by investigating the HIV risk behavior and cofactors of this population's high risk male partners (N=400), using online survey and interview methods successfully applied in the original project (Aim 1). These results will help inform the development of a theory- driven, Internet-based, HIV prevention intervention for individuals who are stigmatized for their gender non- conformity (Aim 2). The intervention will be modeled on an offline HIV intervention shown, in an uncontrolled trial, to reduce risk behavior in the target population. After user-testing and refinement of the prototype online intervention, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial (N=600) to evaluate its efficacy in improving health and reducing HIV risk behavior (Aim 3). This study is innovative in that a) few interventions exist for this minority population and even fewer have been adequately evaluated; b) the intervention will combine HIV prevention and behavior change theories with principles of e-learning; c) the entire study will be implemented online. Our team is highly experienced in HIV prevention research with diverse and vulnerable populations, the benefits/challenges of Internet-based research (online recruitment, data collection, intervention adaptation), and sexual health theory and measures. The project has public health significance in that the minority population targeted for intervention is at high risk for HIV infection, and the men with whom they interact not only pose a risk to them, but also to the general population. If proven effective, the online intervention can be implemented with little additional cost to reduce gender-related HIV risks on a large scale, nationally and internationally, even among highly stigmatized groups.           ",Gender Identity and HIV Risk II,7446065,R01HD057595,"['Data Collection ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Sexual Health ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Range ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Gender Identity ', ' base ', ' cofactor ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' Prevention Research ', ' high risk behavior ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Role "", ' Female Roles ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' prototype ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2008,664150,0.012674160682738618
"HIV Prevention for High Risk African American Young Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is being submitted in response to the NIH's Program Announcement entitled, ""Health Disparities in HIV/AIDS: Focus on African Americans"" (PA-07-289), which recognizes that ""African Americans [represent] a group that has experienced exceptionally high rates of new HIV infections and worse survival rates than other ethnic/racial groups in this country"" A particular focus of this program announcement is the development of ""theoretically based, developmentally appropriate, and culturally sensitive HIV preventive interventions targeting individual, social, and environmental factors for vulnerable African-American populations (e.g., men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers, youth)."" The specific aims of this R21 application are to: 1) adapt an effective, evidence-based intervention called Project AIM (Adult Identity Mentoring) so that it is developmentally appropriate and culturally relevant for use with African-American (AA) young men who have sex with men (YMSM) in Los Angeles; 2) pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of the new intervention that we will call Young Men's AIM (YM-AIM); and 3) identify barriers and facilitators with respect to implementing YM-AIM in community settings. Data from our own Healthy Young Men's (HYM) Study provides strong evidence that AAYMSM are significantly more likely to have experienced racial discrimination and to report significantly higher levels of internalized homophobia than Latino and Caucasian YMSM. AAYMSM are also significantly more likely to experience various forms of violence and victimization, including homophobia, when growing up, sexual/social discrimination based on race, and institutional racism relative to Caucasian and Latino YMSM. These experiences of racism, homophobia, and violence were in turn found to be significantly associated with illicit drug use, alcohol misuse, and involvement in HIV sexual risk behaviors. These and other findings emphasize the need for prevention interventions that are tailored to meet the unique needs and risk profiles of AAYMSM. In this study, we are proposing to adapt an existing HIV prevention intervention called Project AIM for use with 18-24 year old AAYMSM. Project AIM is an effective, evidence-based intervention with demonstrated short- and long-term increases in sexual abstinence and reductions in sexual activity among African-American adolescent males. Drawing upon the Theory of Possible Selves, Project AIM seeks to steer adolescents away from risky behavioral choices by offering alternative avenues to define themselves as adults. Findings from our HYM study, including findings from mixed-methods research conducted with a cohort of 126 AAYMSM (ages 18 to 24 years), will inform the adaptation of Project AIM. We will also engage and solicit input from AAYMSM and local youth service providers. Once adapted, the new intervention (YM-AIM) will be pilot tested to determine its feasibility and acceptability and to identify barriers and facilitators with respect to implementing YM-AIM in community settings.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Rates of HIV infections continue to rise among African American young men who have sex with men, and yet it remains the case that few prevention interventions have been developed specifically for this population. We are proposing to adapt and pilot test the Adolescent Identity Mentoring (AIM) intervention, an evidence-based prevention intervention that has previously been found to be effective with younger high-risk African American youth.          ",HIV Prevention for High Risk African American Young Men,7418549,R21DA024588,"['Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Other Finding ', ' Suspension substance ', ' suspension ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Rate ', ' sex ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' adolescent boy ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Depth ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' racism ', ' Infection ', ' Ensure ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Los Angeles ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Motivation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Abstinence ', ' sex abstinence ', ' not sexually active ', ' celibate ', ' abstaining from sex ', ' abstain from sexual intercouse ', ' abstain from sexual activity ', ' abstain from intercouse ', ' Celibacy ', ' Social Discrimination ', ' Victimization ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Suspensions ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Country ', ' Behavior ', ' Services ', ' transgender ', ' transsexual ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' response ', ' desire ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Coitus ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' alcohol misuse ', ' unhealthy alcohol use ', ' ethanol misuse ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' ']",NIDA,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R21,2008,315000,0.03914307482408356
"Self-Silencing and African-American and Latina Women's HIV Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding factors that contribute to African American and Latina women's elevated levels of HIV risk is a research area urgently in need of attention. The proposed research fills this gap by investigating the gendered and cultural factors that contribute to African-American and Latina women's sexual risk-taking behaviors. The proposed research will investigate the role of self- silencing (i.e., the extent to which women inhibit their self-expression to create and maintain valued interpersonal relationships) in sexual risk-taking using secondary data analysis of a four- wave, 18-month longitudinal study of 512 African American and Latina women (ages 18-67) in the greater San Francisco Bay Area. The three specific aims of the study are: (1) to test self- silencing as a predictor of women's sexual risk-taking behaviors (i.e., engaging in vaginal and anal intercourse without the use of a condom), developing separate models for African- American and Latina women; (2) to examine intrapersonal mechanisms (i.e., self-esteem, condom use self-efficacy, and sexual comfort) and interpersonal mechanisms (i.e., perceived negative relational consequences of condom use and perceived relationship power) through which self-silencing may contribute to women's sexual risk-taking; and (3) to examine the potential moderating roles of socioeconomic status and age on the association between self- silencing and sexual risk-taking. Distinct statistical modeling techniques (i.e., multivariate latent growth curve modeling and multi-group analysis) will be used to address the three specific aims. The proposed research will deepen our understanding of the factors that contribute to the staggering racial/ethnic disparities in HIV and other sexually transmitted infections among women. Self-Silencing and African-American and Latina Women's HIV Risk Behaviors Project Narrative While African American and Latina women combined represent less than a quarter of all women in the United States, they account for over three-quarters of newly identified HIV infections in women. The proposed research will deepen our understanding of the gendered and cultural factors that contribute to the staggering racial/ethnic disparities in HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Findings will guide educators and health care providers wishing to promote behavioral change in the women who are disproportionately affected by these infections.          ",Self-Silencing and African-American and Latina Women's HIV Risk,7544887,R03HD059306,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Address ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Behavioral ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Area ', ' Infection ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' self esteem ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Attention ', ' Woman ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Gender ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Accounting ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NICHD,SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2008,76500,0.05754181698893455
"Understanding Female Partners of Bisexual Men: Implications for HIV/STD Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the United States, the reported rates of new HIV diagnoses among black and Hispanic women are, respectively, 20 and 5.4 times that of white women. A greater tendency toward bisexual behavior and non-gay identification among black and Hispanic men who have sex with men (MSM) than among white MSM is thought to contribute to the large racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS observed among women; however, nearly nothing is known about the female partners of behaviorally bisexual men. Furthermore, many HIV-infected women are considered ""heterosexual unidentified risk"" because they do not fit into an HIV transmission category other than sex with a male of unidentified risk. We propose a two-phase study to better understand HIV risk among women of color by identifying predictors of sex with bisexual and unidentified risk men and exploring psychosocial issues surrounding and correlates of these sexual partnerships. This research will be carried out among African-American and Latina females recently tested for HIV in publicly funded test sites in Los Angeles County.       In Phase I, a matched case-control analysis will be carried out using secondary data to identify predictors of having had sex with a bisexual man or of being diagnosed HIV-antibody positive with unidentified heterosexual risk. In Phase II, recently tested women will be recruited and interviewed, including 30 who report bisexual male partners and 20 HIV-infected women with unidentified sexual risk. The in-depth semi-structured interview will examine psychosocial factors surrounding sexual relationships with men, including known bisexual, potentially bisexual, and presumed heterosexual men and explore (1) the range of relationship types characterizing women's relationships with these men; (2) attitudes regarding gender roles and desired partner traits; (3) how and when participants became aware of their partners' bisexual behavior and how this awareness influenced their HIV risk perception; (4) how HIV-antibody positive women with unidentified sexual risk perceive they and their partners were infected; and (5) participant's attitudes and behaviors regarding health-related research, health care, and STD/HIV prevention. Interview transcripts will be analyzed using a consensual qualitative research approach to identify major themes and generate hypotheses and survey items for a larger quantitative interview study comparing women reporting sex with a bisexual male to women who do not believe that they have had sex with a bisexual man. They will also help direct prevention resources and guide HIV prevention intervention approaches among women of color.          ",Understanding Female Partners of Bisexual Men: Implications for HIV/STD Risk ,7430685,SC3GM083780,"['psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Sampling ', ' desire ', ' case control ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Color ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' safer sex ', ' stem ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Conservatism ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Data ', ' Range ', ' Social Aspects of Cancer ', ' Transcript ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' Female ', ' Affect ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Age ', ' Bisexual ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Depth ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Collaborations ', ' Anal Sex ', ' Oral Sex ', ' Perception ', ' permissiveness ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' self esteem ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Social Desirability ', ' Social Desirabilities ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Awareness ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' resource guides ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Categories ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' County ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' ']",NIGMS,CHARLES R.

"HIV Risk among Male Parolees and their Female Partners    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects prisoners in the United States. Women of color and low-income women in the United States also have disproportionately high rates of HIV infection and AIDS diagnosis. Recent studies have shown that racial disparities in incarceration can be linked to health disparities, including disparities in HIV/AIDS. Research exploring how the disproportionate levels of HIV/AIDS among incarcerated men and among low-income women of color are related is crucial. The proposed study will be conducted with both members of male-female couples in which the male partner was recently released from prison and is under parole supervision (""male parolees""). The specific aims of the proposed study are: 1) Using quantitative methods, we will assess the HIV-risk behaviors of each member of the couple and identify individual-level and couple-level psychosocial influences on HIV risk and risk reduction; 2) Using qualitative methods, we will describe the unique influence of the context of a man's incarceration on couples' decision-making processes involving HIV risk and risk reduction; 3) Using quantitative and qualitative methods, we will investigate how males' and females' perspectives on HIV risk and risk reduction influence both their own behavior and behavior within the couple. Our preliminary studies have underscored the complexities of understanding how the context of a man's incarceration influences couples' decision-making processes involving HIV risk and risk reduction and have compelled us to undertake couple-level research on this issue. Public-health researchers have identified the necessity of developing and providing population-specific HIV interventions and services for people affected by incarceration both in prison and in their home neighborhoods post-release. The proposed research will yield critical information about HIV risk and risk reduction in dyadic relationships between male parolees and their female partners that can be used to develop population-appropriate and effective interventions for the millions of low-income people of color who experience their own or their partner's incarceration each year.           ",HIV Risk among Male Parolees and their Female Partners,7692651,R01MH078743,"['Couples ', ' Decision Making ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Dreams ', ' dreaming ', ' Low income ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Social Aspects of Cancer ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Left ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Link ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Gender Relations ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Prisoner ', ' jail inmate ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' Prisons ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' programs ', ' Supervision ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' information gathering ', ' experience ', ' AIDS diagnosis ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' parolee ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' parole ', ' Emotional ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Color ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' service intervention ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2008,29330,0.02642058589971276
"Reducing HIV Heterosexual Risk Among African-American Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A large gap exists between the prevention needs of African-American, heterosexual men and the number and quality of programs demonstrated to meet these needs. Men who identify or are classified as Black are at increased risk, as compared to other racial/ethnic groups, for HIV infection acquired through heterosexual risk behavior. An important challenge is to design effective, sustainable programs that have potential to target this population and that can address multiple levels of factors that impact HIV-related behaviors. The barbershop setting is one venue that has significant promise as a vehicle for delivery of such programs, as this setting is widely and frequently used, has potential to build upon extant and trusting relationships, and can help promote a normative environment in support of behavior change. Investigators at SUNY Downstate Medical Center and the Arthur Ashe Institute of Urban Health, Inc. will build on their success in developing, implementing, and evaluating health promotion activities administered in community settings such as hair salons and barbershops by developing a program that will reach heterosexual men in barbershops serving communities with high HIV morbidity and AIDS- related mortality. We propose to: (1) Develop a steering committee consisting of key community stakeholders, representatives from organizations comprising our existing community partnerships, program investigators, and other key informants, (2) Conduct qualitative and quantiative formative evaluation to describe key individual and contextual level factors related to risk behavior in this population, and (3) design, implement, and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a theory-based behavioral intervention to reduce the burden of HIV. This three- year program will focus on development of the relationships, resources, infrastructure, and preliminary data necessary to implement and evaluate full-scale intervention programs designed to address these issues. This program seeks to design a community-based HIV prevention program that meets the needs of African American heterosexual men. As such, this proposal will meet a priority need as identified by our community, seek to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in disease as evidenced by epidemiologic data, and address the Healthy People 2010 overall goals to ""Prevent human immunodeficiency virus infection and its related illness and death"" and to ""Promote responsible sexual behaviors, strengthen community capacity, and increase access to quality services to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and their complications.""           ",Reducing HIV Heterosexual Risk Among African-American Men,7491087,UR6PS000691,[''],NCHHSTP,SUNY DOWNSTATE MEDICAL CENTER,UR6,2008,396099,0.04135482605528618
"Disparities in Lung and Colorectal Cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific segments of the population bear a greater cancer burden than the general population. It has been hypothesized that sexual minorities are among the population groups likely to experience cancer disparities. However, in the absence of reliable population-based data that include sexual orientation, this hypothesis has yet to be tested. This secondary data analysis will link two data sources, SEER and the US Census, to assess if sexual minorities are unequally affected by cancer. Using a county-level proxy for sexual orientation, we will test the hypothesis that geographic areas in which sexual minorities (defined as same-sex partnered households) are concentrated have higher lung and colorectal cancer incidence, more advanced stage at diagnosis, and greater cancer mortality compared to areas with few sexual minority women. A secondary goal is to consider the economic structure of the geographic areas in which sexual minorities live so that any disparities in the cancer burden are appropriately attributed. We have four specific aims to identify lung and colorectal cancer disparities: 1. Examine the relationship of lung cancer incidence to the percentage of sexual minority populations (defined as female or male same-sex partnered households) in a geographic area and examine the relationship of colorectal cancer incidence to the percentage of SMW. 2. Determine the rate of late stage lung cancer diagnoses to the percentage of sexual minority populations in a geographic area and determine the rate of late stage colorectal cancer diagnoses to the percentage of SMW. 3. Compare lung cancer mortality as a function of percentage of sexual minority populations in a geographic area and compare colorectal cancer mortality as a function of percentage of SMW in a geographic area. 4.

"Feasibility of recruiting nondisclosing Black MSM/W for drug use /HIV research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will investigate the feasibility of conducting ethnographic research on HIV risk among drug-using Black men who have sex with men and women but do not identify as gay or homosexual and do not disclose their same-sex activity to their female partners. Because these men do not identify as gay or homosexual, there is concern that they are not being reached by programs aimed at gay-identified communities. The specific aims are: 1) To locate and recruit for interviewing drug-using Black men who have sex with men and women (MSM/W) but do not disclose their same-sex activity to their female partners. 2) To gain a preliminary understanding of how Black MSM/W decide whether and what to disclose about their HIV risk behaviors including drug use and high risk sexual practices. Because male-to-male sexual contact is the most commonly reported HIV/AIDS transmission category among men, there is a growing body of research on MSM, including Black MSM/W. However, there appear to be no systematic investigations of patterns of drug use among Black MSM/W or on the issue of disclosing same-sex activity to female partners. There is speculation that Black MSM/W constitute a ""bridge"" population facilitating HIV infection among Black women but there is insufficient empirical evidence to substantiate the claim. The broad goal of this project is to foster further research on the relationship between drug use and HIV risk among Black adults, in order to develop a better understanding of the severe racial disparities in HIV/AIDS infection. Black men are six times more likely than White men to be infected, and Black women are 19 times as likely as White women to be infected. This project will employ two ethnographers to recruit men through four sources: 1) existing social networks established in our previous research in low-income, high-HIV neighborhoods; 2) known MSM venues such as clubs, bars, parks and street locations; 3) Internet sites and 4) groups and organizations serving drug users and ex-offenders. Five small focus groups at two points in the study will help to enhance our recruitment strategy and shape lines of inquiry regarding decisions to conceal or disclose behavior. Ethnographers will also cultivate relationships with and conduct individual interviews with 30 men to obtain preliminary insights into drug use and MSM activity, knowledge and management of HIV risk and factors influencing disclosure decisions. If the proposed feasibility study yields a successful strategy for recruiting and interviewing Black MSM/W, it can be incorporated into a subsequent larger effort (an R01) designed to collect more extensive data that can inform appropriate risk-reduction interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This feasibility study is designed to improve research on HIV risk and protective factors among drug-involved men who have sex with men and women. The study is focused on Black men who do not identify as gay or homosexual and do not disclose their same-sex activity to their female partners. Because these men do not identify as gay or homosexual, they may not be reached by prevention programs aimed at gay-identified communities.

"Young Women With Acute Myocardial Infarction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young women with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) represent an extreme phenotype in ischemic heart disease risk and, at the same time, constitute a large understudied group with excess mortality risk compared with similarly aged men. This combination of adverse risk and inadequate investigation provides a critically important opportunity to address the care and outcomes of young women with AMI to uncover key biological and environmental determinants of their prognosis. Accordingly, we propose the first large, comprehensive, observational study of young women with AMI (YWAMI). YWAMI will include 2,000 women, 18-55 years of age, with AMI and a comparison cohort of 1,000 men enrolled over 3 years from 88 hospitals across the United States and in Canada. To accomplish these aims we have assembled a team of leading researchers in sex disparities in cardiovascular disease, outcomes research, epidemiology, statistics, genetics, biomarker research, health status measurement, psychosocial research, cardiology, and emergency medicine. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) characterize sex differences in outcomes following AMI (including mortality, hospitalization and health status); 2) determine sex differences in the prevalence of demographic, clinical, and psychosocial risk factors; 3) determine sex differences in quality of care; and 4) determine sex differences in the prevalence of selected biological factors (including sex hormones, biomarkers and genetic variations). We will characterize these differences in great detail and elucidate the biological and environmental factors that are responsible for disparities in outcomes. The analyses from all four aims will be used to develop clinically useful risk-stratification models for young AMI patients, explain sex differences in outcomes and identify targets for intervention. We will also bank serum and DMA from each subject, creating a resource for anticipated future studies of the molecular biology of AMI in young women and men. We will work with the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association and VHA, Inc. to disseminate findings from this study that can be used to improve the prevention, care, and outcomes for young women and men with AMI. Public Health Implications: Overall, although heart disease in young women accounts for as many deaths as breast cancer, few studies have addressed the biological, environmental and social factors that influence their outcome. Young women with heart attacks have a higher risk of dying than similarly aged men. We propose to conduct the largest, most comprehensive study of young women with heart attacks to identify the key determinants of their recovery and discover knowledge that will assist us in improving their care.              ",Young Women With Acute Myocardial Infarction,7483702,R01HL081153,"['Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' heart disease risk ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogenic Compounds ', ' Estrogenic Agents ', ' Caring ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Prognostic Factor ', ' Prognostic/Survival Factor ', ' General Prognostic Factor ', ' Range ', ' Stratification ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Genetic Status ', ' Observational Study ', ' Update ', ' sex ', ' Cardiac ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Female ', ' Guidelines ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' improved ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Reproductive History ', ' Reproductive Issues ', ' Reproductive History Epidemiology ', ' Reproductive Factors ', ' Inflammation ', ' Inpatients ', ' Ensure ', ' prognostic ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Numbers ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' American Heart Association ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Menstrual cycle ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Patients ', ' Metabolic ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Physicians ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' sex steroid ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Biologic Marker ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' lipid metabolism ', ' fat metabolism ', ' cohort ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Canada ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Cardiology ', ' Cardiovascular Disease (Specialty) ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' social ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' genetic resource ', ' Accounting ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' comparison group ', ' neglect ', ' genetic variant ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' older women ', ' ']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,3410890,0.03916140872141774
"A Brief, Clinic-Based, HIV Prevention Program for African American Teen Males    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has declared that AIDS is a ""state of emergency"" in the US relative to African Americans. Teen males attending STD clinics are one important, yet often neglected, population of African Americans at risk of HIV acquisition. Despite extremely high rates of STD acquisition (and subsequent infection) among this population, effective clinic-based interventions specifically designed to reduce their sexual risk behavior for STD/HIV have not been developed/disseminated. A recent intervention trial (conducted by Dr. Crosby) demonstrated the efficacy of a brief, clinic-based, intervention designed to prevent subsequent STI acquisition among African American males 18 to 29 years of age. The proposed study will test the efficacy this intervention (in modified form) to reduce STI incidence among African American teen (15 to 20 years old). The primary hypothesis is that teens randomized to receive the intervention will have a lower incidence rate of laboratory-confirmed STIs at 2 and 6-month follow-up assessments (as well as 12-month follow-up conducted by a medical records review) compared to those receiving an attention-equivalent control condition. Teens (N = 840) will be recruited from a publicly-funded STD clinic located in an urban area of the South. After completing an A-CASI assessment, teens will be rated on their ability to apply condoms to a penile model and then asked to donate a urine specimen for STI testing. Specimens will be tested for C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and T. Vaginalis using nucleic acid amplification assays. Randomization will then be achieved by a concealment of allocation technique. Teens will be randomized to immediately receive: 1) a brief (60 minute) theory-based, one-on-one, interactive intervention delivered by a lay health advisor or 2) an attention equivalent control condition. The assessment battery will be repeated 2 months subsequent to enrollment and again 6 months after enrollment. A medical records review will be conducted 12 months after enrollment to compare clinic reported incidence rates between the randomized groups of teens. If incidence of STIs in this population of teens can be decreased as substantially as was found in the previous study of 18 to 29 year-old African American males (percent relative difference = 36.7), the public health significance for African American teen males will substantially contribute to rectify the racial disparity in HIV/STD experienced by African American teen males. By extension, we suggest that their partners (typically African American teen females) will also benefit. Because our program is designed for ease of implementation, the number of dissemination and translation issues will be greatly minimized thereby greatly facilitating the process of translating research into practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed efficacy trial tests an innovative method of bridging the gap between research and practice. By providing a brief, clinic-based, HIV/STD prevention program to African American teen males attending an STD clinic, the study will be the first to demonstrate that teen's sexual risk behavior can be reduced without excessive time and resources. The focus on African American teen males is also quite timely given the recent declaration by CDC that AIDS is a ""state of emergency"" for African Americans.          ","A Brief, Clinic-Based, HIV Prevention Program for African American Teen Males",7497784,R01MH083621,"['Health Educators ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Caring ', ' Age-Years ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Rate ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Goals ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Depth ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Kentucky ', ' Laboratories ', ' Numbers ', ' Pliability ', ' pliable ', ' Funding ', ' male ', ' Medical Records ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Neisseria gonorrhoeae ', ' N.gonorrhoeae ', ' N. gonorrhoeae ', ' Gonococcus ', ' Glare ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' Perception ', ' Brothers ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Condition ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Trichomonas Infections ', ' trichomoniasis ', ' Trichomonosis ', ' Disease due to Trichomonadidae ', ' Trichomonas vaginalis ', ' T. vaginalis ', ' United States ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Attention ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' day ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Clinic ', ' Upper arm ', ' Techniques ', ' size ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' condoms ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' Reporting ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Chlamydia ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Instruction ', ' avoid sex ', ' neglect ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 20 year old ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' safer sex ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' research to practice ', ' research into practice ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2008,366250,0.032206087984981945
"Gender Identity and HIV Risk II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a revised submission for a 5-year competitive continuation to grant 1R01-DA015269, Gender Identity and HIV Risk. The long-range goal of our research is to reduce HIV transmission among individuals stigmatized for their gender nonconformity and diversity, a goal consistent with the Healthy People 2010 objective to reduce the nation's health disparities. Key findings from our prior work were: a) a national sample of these individuals can be effectively reached via the Internet; b) differences in sex, gender identity/role, and sexual orientation are associated with important differences in HIV risk behavior; c) individuals in the female role are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection through the high risk behavior of the men with whom they interact. We propose to build on these findings by investigating the HIV risk behavior and cofactors of this population's high risk male partners (N=400), using online survey and interview methods successfully applied in the original project (Aim 1). These results will help inform the development of a theory- driven, Internet-based, HIV prevention intervention for individuals who are stigmatized for their gender non- conformity (Aim 2). The intervention will be modeled on an offline HIV intervention shown, in an uncontrolled trial, to reduce risk behavior in the target population. After user-testing and refinement of the prototype online intervention, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial (N=600) to evaluate its efficacy in improving health and reducing HIV risk behavior (Aim 3). This study is innovative in that a) few interventions exist for this minority population and even fewer have been adequately evaluated; b) the intervention will combine HIV prevention and behavior change theories with principles of e-learning; c) the entire study will be implemented online. Our team is highly experienced in HIV prevention research with diverse and vulnerable populations, the benefits/challenges of Internet-based research (online recruitment, data collection, intervention adaptation), and sexual health theory and measures. The project has public health significance in that the minority population targeted for intervention is at high risk for HIV infection, and the men with whom they interact not only pose a risk to them, but also to the general population. If proven effective, the online intervention can be implemented with little additional cost to reduce gender-related HIV risks on a large scale, nationally and internationally, even among highly stigmatized groups.

"Disparities in sexually transmitted infections among young women: Role of individ    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although there are significant and longstanding racial disparities in sexually transmitted infections (STI) among young women, their causal mechanisms are unidentified. Unprotected sex, concurrency, and partner choice are well established risk factors, but they do not account for the differences between racial groups. One factor known to differ significantly by race and correlate strongly with STI risk is incarceration. High rates of incarceration and crime in a community have also been associated with higher STI prevalence in that community. Despite these associations and the dramatic differences in incarceration by race, few researchers have studied both individual- and community-level exposure to incarceration and crime and assessed whether these may partially explain STI disparities among young women. Among young women, incarceration and crime may influence STI risk both directly and indirectly. Interaction with the justice system may directly influence sexual risk behavior or substance use social norms. Following incarceration, an individual may have greater difficulty obtaining social services and gainful employment. Incarceration breaks up existing sexual partnerships and family units, removing and distancing the individual or partner and his/her economic and/or social support. Less direct effects of high incarceration rates in a community may lead to a paucity of eligible males, contributing to women having less power to negotiate condom use or being more tolerant of her partner's concurrency. Ex-offenders may change community social norms and transmit STIs as a result of their own riskier sexual behaviors and increased STI burden. In addition to these direct and indirect effects of incarceration, the confounding individual and community factors which may contribute to the likelihood of incarceration may also contribute to STI acquisition. In short, although the existing literature has repeatedly reported associations between incarceration and STIs, the direct, indirect, and confounding mechanisms have been difficult to tease apart and inadequately addressed to date. By building on relationships with justice system and public health leaders, our interdisciplinary team will link juvenile detention, incarceration, public health and clinical data sources at an individual-level to study incarceration, crime and STIs among young women 14 to 25 years old. The 10-year longitudinal data will help answer whether the association between incarceration and STI is causal or confounding and allow us to investigate further which specific factors of incarceration - timing, duration, indication, and recidivism history - contribute most to STI risk. We will employ geospatial methodologies to examine the effects of community-level incarceration in more depth, using point-level data and different extents of exposure. As different mechanisms may contribute to the spread of various STI differently, we will evaluate Chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV independently and in combination. Most importantly, we will evaluate how differences in individual- and community-level incarceration and crime may contribute to STI disparities among African American compared to white young women. Specifically, we aim to (1) assess whether the association between incarceration and sexually transmitted infections (STI) is stronger when incarceration precedes first STI; (2) assess whether community incarceration and crime rates are associated with an individual's risk of STI, after accounting for an individual's incarceration history; and (3) assess whether increased risk of STI among minority young women is diminished when accounting for an individual's differential incarceration rate and exposure to community incarceration and crime rates. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a result of the proposed research, we will better understand the relationship between incarceration, crime and sexually transmitted infection (STI) among young women and whether it contributes to significant racial disparities in STI. With this increased understanding, we will be better able to target resources to individuals and communities in need -during or preceding incarceration, in the community and/or through the justice system. From a public health and health services perspective, this information will aid in guiding policy and individually-targeted action in STI treatment and prevention.            As a result of the proposed research, we will better understand the relationship between incarceration, crime and sexually transmitted infection (STI) among young women and whether it contributes to significant racial disparities in STI.

"Reducing Sexual Risk Behaviors among Rural African-American Cocaine Users PROJECT SUMMARY: HIV and other sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates continue to rise disproportionately among African-Americans, and particularly dramatically among rural populations. Stimulant use, especially cocaine use, among rural African-Americans is also increasing, and is related to multiple risk behaviors for HIV/STI, including sex with multiple partners, exchanging sex for drugs and other commodities, and inconsistent condom use. Despite these documented risk patterns, and the increasing disparities in HIV/STI incidence, few theory-based interventions have been specifically designed and tested for rural African-American populations with high-risk behavioral patterns. The primary aims of this project are to adapt an existing risk reduction program to the needs of rural African-American cocaine users, to test the adapted intervention's efficacy via a behavioral clinical trial, and to answer outstanding questions regarding intraclass correlation and sampling methodologies in the sexual risk reduction literature. The project team will conduct a longitudinal intervention study with stratified group randomization, so that participants receive the sexual risk intervention or an active control intervention condition in groups. Each intervention condition is equivalent in terms of contact time and in terms of number and type of contacts (each participant receives two group sessions, two individual sessions, two community-building sessions, and two follow-up booster sessions over four months). Respondent-driven sampling will be used to recruit and enroll 280 participants across two rural, predominantly African-American counties in the Arkansas Delta region to one of the two intervention conditions. The primary outcome variables will include condom use skills, sexual negotiation skills, and self-reported risk behaviors. Additional measures, including self-efficacy for decreased sexual risk, perceived peer norms for sexual risk, perceived benefits and barriers of sexual risk reduction, social support and social trust, mental health status, partner violence, and substance use, will also be collected to assess their theory-based mediating and moderating influences on the sexual risk skills and behaviors. Assessments will be conducted prior to the intervention, immediately post-intervention, and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. This project brings together a strong, experienced investigative team which has an established, trusting relationship with the community that will be involved in the study. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE: The project not only will provide critically-needed information about the efficacy of tailored behavioral interventions among rural African-Americans at high risk for HIV/STIs, but also will allow the study team to investigate important methodological questions about the use of respondent- driven sampling approaches in rural settings and about intraclass correlation coefficients for sexual risk measures in tight-knit rural communities. This research can thus make important contributions that address racial disparities in HIV/STIs, provide approaches for slowing the rapid growth of the epidemics in rural areas, and inform methodological innovations of importance to sexual risk reduction science.

"Gender, Power and Latino Mens HIV Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): AIDS has been a leading cause of death among Latino women and men 25 to 44 years of age for more than a decade. The few HIV prevention and treatment interventions developed specifically for Latino men have focused on injecting drug users (IDU) or men who have sex with men (MSM), but have neglected a critical epidemiological group, men who have sex with men and with women (MSMW). This group is particularly relevant in understanding the spread of HIV given the role they play in sexual network connections between the homosexually active male population and heterosexual population. The proposed study will develop an innovative pilot intervention for behaviorally bisexual Latino men. We propose the following specific aims: 1) To describe the mechanisms by which contextual factors of labor and cultural backgrounds (such as access to employment, ethnic-racial tensions, coping with job-related situations, heterosexism and gender norms in the workplace) influence bisexual men's likelihood of engaging in risky sexual practices; 2)To explore how men's notions of power are shaped by the centrality of family and religious background, and how these factors in turn, facilitate or prevent sexual risk taking among bisexual Latino men; 3) To describe bisexual Latino men's ideologies of HIV risk, the geographical context of HIV risk, and how bisexual risk behavior, and how they are related or not to gender and power dynamics in the men's lives; and, 4) To examine how the perceptions of members of AIDS Service Delivery Organizations (ASDOs) of societal notions of Latino masculinity and bisexuality create or limit access to HIV prevention services for bisexual Latino men in the New York Metropolitan Area. To accomplish these aims, we propose a 4-year ethnographic study design with two components of data collection. The first component will consists of in-depth interviews with behaviorally bisexual Latino men (n=160) from five research sites in the New York City metropolitan area. The first two years of the study will be dedicated to the in-depth interviews component. The second data collection component of the study will be an ethnography. This component will last 3 years, beginning in years 1 and 2 with key informant interviews (n=25) and continuing in year 3 with ethnographic mapping and 25 group interviews with AIDS Service Delivery Organizations across the 5 research sites. The last year of the project will focus on using Intervention Mapping (IM) to analyze the data collected and design the pilot intervention to reduce HIV risk among bisexual Latino men. The proposed study will be one of the first large-scale research projects to focus on issues of bisexuality and HIV risk among Latinos in the United States.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: 1. Given the raise in HIV cases in the United States, particularly among homosexually and bisexually active men of color, this study takes an innovative approach to the examination of HIV risk among by exploring how broad forms of social inequality and the sexual ecology of bisexual behavior among Latino men constrain the options for a relatively less powerful group of men, and how ideologies of masculinity intersect with structural social inequalities to create HIV risks for bisexual Latino men. 2. This will be one of the first large-scale research projects to focus on issues of bisexuality and HIV risk among Latinos and the first one to examine how the context of labor and sexual markets shape the sexual lives and health risks of bisexual men of color. 3.

"Reducing sexual risk among African American heterosexual men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Abstract The purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test a novel group-level intervention to reduce sexual risk behavior and increase HIV testing among heterosexually active African American men. Heterosexually active men have been called the ""forgotten group"" in HIV prevention, with the bulk of interventions focusing on women or other groups at high risk of HIV. In the United States, heterosexual contact is currently the second highest mode of HIV acquisition and African Americans are over-represented among these cases. New York City is the metropolitan area with the largest number of AIDS cases among African American men attributed to heterosexual contact. We propose a mixed-method study among adult heterosexually active African American men living in high prevalence neighborhoods with the aims to: 1) explore through in-depth qualitative interviews and focus groups personal, behavioral, and socio-structural factors that affect HIV sexual risk behavior and HIV testing rates, and participant perspectives on intervention characteristics; 2) develop and pilot test the intervention; and 3) estimate the efficacy of the intervention on reducing sexual risk behaviors and increasing HIV testing. To achieve these aims, we propose to conduct 6 focus groups and 50 in-depth interviews to elicit: (a) descriptions and reflections on personal, behavioral and socio-structural factors that impact on HIV sexual risk behavior and HIV testing. These factors will be examined from a general perspective and through questions that elicit descriptions, reflections, and comparisons of past sexual risk events, both high and low risk, and the factors affecting the course of those events; (b) participant perspectives on intervention characteristics that may effectively lead to reductions in high risk behavior and increases in HIV testing. We will then develop and pilot test a multi-session group-level intervention informed by the findings of our formative research, and pilot test the interview instrument. In the last phase, we will conduct a pre-post test study by enrolling 50 heterosexually active African American men at risk of HIV infection into the intervention. At baseline and 3 months, standardized data collection using audio computer assisted self-interviewing technology will assess outcomes and covariates. The primary outcomes for the estimating efficacy will be the occurrence of unprotected vaginal intercourse and/or unprotected anal intercourse with female partners and concurrent partnering with female and/or male partners. Secondary outcomes will include occurrence of HIV testing and number of new and total female and male sex partners. The results of this proposed project will be used to estimate sample size or effect size for scaling up to a randomized controlled trial. The heterosexual HIV epidemic is a growing public health problem in the United States. African Americans are over-represented among these cases, contributing to the growing health disparities that characterize the HIV epidemic in the US. This study will develop and test a behavioral intervention to reduce sexual risk and increase HIV testing among heterosexually active African American men.            PROJECT NARRATIVE The heterosexual HIV epidemic is a growing public health problem in the United States.

"Reducing HIV Heterosexual Risk Among African-American Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A large gap exists between the prevention needs of African-American, heterosexual men and the number and quality of programs demonstrated to meet these needs. Men who identify or are classified as Black are at increased risk, as compared to other racial/ethnic groups, for HIV infection acquired through heterosexual risk behavior. An important challenge is to design effective, sustainable programs that have potential to target this population and that can address multiple levels of factors that impact HIV-related behaviors. The barbershop setting is one venue that has significant promise as a vehicle for delivery of such programs, as this setting is widely and frequently used, has potential to build upon extant and trusting relationships, and can help promote a normative environment in support of behavior change. Investigators at SUNY Downstate Medical Center and the Arthur Ashe Institute of Urban Health, Inc. will build on their success in developing, implementing, and evaluating health promotion activities administered in community settings such as hair salons and barbershops by developing a program that will reach heterosexual men in barbershops serving communities with high HIV morbidity and AIDS- related mortality. We propose to: (1) Develop a steering committee consisting of key community stakeholders, representatives from organizations comprising our existing community partnerships, program investigators, and other key informants, (2) Conduct qualitative and quantiative formative evaluation to describe key individual and contextual level factors related to risk behavior in this population, and (3) design, implement, and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a theory-based behavioral intervention to reduce the burden of HIV. This three- year program will focus on development of the relationships, resources, infrastructure, and preliminary data necessary to implement and evaluate full-scale intervention programs designed to address these issues. This program seeks to design a community-based HIV prevention program that meets the needs of African American heterosexual men. As such, this proposal will meet a priority need as identified by our community, seek to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in disease as evidenced by epidemiologic data, and address the Healthy People 2010 overall goals to ""Prevent human immunodeficiency virus infection and its related illness and death"" and to ""Promote responsible sexual behaviors, strengthen community capacity, and increase access to quality services to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and their complications.""            Project Narrative This program seeks to design a community-based HIV prevention program that meets the needs of African American heterosexual men.

"Web-Based Intervention for Black Bisexually-Active Men    Description (provided by the applicant): African Americans are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS, and this disparity is further evident among bisexually-active African American men (BAAM).Yet, there is insufficient knowledge regarding sexual risk behaviors of BAAM and the context in which they occur. To date, no interventions in the literature with demonstrated efficacy in reducing HIV-related sexual risk behaviors have been developed and evaluated for BAAM who do not inject drugs. The proposed study will develop and test the efficacy and acceptability of an innovative individually-tailored and culturally-sensitive 6-session online-delivered video intervention that simultaneously targets multiple domains of socio-cultural, structural-level factors, and contextual factors related to HIV risk behavior among BAAM, relative to an attention control (education) condition. This intervention is theoretically informed both in content (using the Information-Motivation-Behavior Skills model) and delivery (using tenets of Social Cognitive theory) and will feature peer BAAM. Both behavioral and biologic outcomes will be measured. Using respondent-driven sampling, a total of 120 BAAM will be enrolled and randomly assigned to either treatment or education-control conditions. They will be longitudinally tracked for six months (assessed at Baseline, month 3, and month 6). In addition to determining the prevalence of lifetime and recent HIV-associated risk behavior among BAAM,   this study seeks to evaluate the impact of a brief intervention across three domains over time: (1)   intentions/motivations to reduce HIV-associated risk behavior, (2) self-reported HIV-associated risk behavior, and (3) health/prevention knowledge and self-efficacy skills. The long term goal of the proposed project is to develop an empirically validated HIV/STI prevention program that can be delivered online BAAM. Consistent with the R34 mechanism, the final product will be the basis for   an R01 application to conduct a large-scale efficacy study in this population. Should this intervention   demonstrate effective, it will be a cost feasible approach to preventing HIV transmissions among BAAM, delivered via the medium where many men who have sex with men (including BAAM) actively meet sex partners (i.e., the Internet). Finally, the model for this intervention can easily be adopted by HIV service providers and delivered outside of traditional clinical setting with a variety of populations.            7. Project Narrative The findings of this study will facilitate a more nuanced understanding of HIV-associated risk behaviors of bisexually-active African American men (BAAM) and the context in which they occur, which will, in turn, inform prevention and intervention efforts. Specifically, the findings will inform HIV prevention, interventions, and treatments designed to reduce HIV associated risk behaviors.

"Tailoring ""Real Men Are Safe"" for African American and Hispanic Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses two broad Challenge Areas, (05) Comparative Effectiveness Research and (09) Health Disparities, and specific Challenge Topics, 05-MD-102 Prevention of Chronic Diseases in Disparity Populations , and 09-DA-101 Health disparities and access to participation in research. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that Blacks and Hispanics are overrepresented among men with HIV infection compared to Whites. The Clinical Trial Network (CTN) of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) recently completed a randomized clinical trial evaluating the utility of the Real Men Are Safe (REMAS) HIV prevention intervention targeting men in substance abuse treatment. Men assigned to the REMAS groups engaged in fewer unprotected vaginal and anal intercourse occasions during the 90 days prior to the 3- and 6-month post-intervention follow-ups than men assigned to a standard HIV Education group. Post hoc analyses suggest Whites benefited more from the intervention than African Americans, and possibly Hispanics. The challenge proposed in this application is to revise the REMAS intervention, shown to be effective in the multisite CTN trial, to be more culturally relevant to African American and Hispanic participants. A two phase study is proposed for revising the REMAS intervention. In Phase 1 we will conduct formative research by convening a panel of academic and community based experts knowledgeable in HIV prevention in African American and Hispanic communities. Utilizing the Delphi process panel members will review the REMAS materials and make suggestions for revisions. The panel will be asked to help develop a revised version of the REMAS intervention which would be culturally viable for a mixed group of whites, African Americans and Hispanics. In phase 2 the revised REMAS version would be pilot tested for feasibility and acceptability in four community treatment programs within the NIDA CTN which have high percentages of either African American and/or Hispanic clientele. Prior research has demonstrated that the Real Men Are Safe (REMAS) HIV prevention intervention has been effective in helping men in substance abuse treatment lessen their sexual risk behavior. However, the intervention appeared to be more effective with whites as compared to African Americans and possibly Hispanics.

"Syndemic Development and HIV Risk Among Vulnerable Young Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the number of new HIV infections has been relatively stable since late 1990s, the face of the infection has changed. Half of all new infections now occur among youth and substantial disparities exist based on sexual orientation. Recent data from the National HIV/AIDS Reporting System indicate that male-to-male sexual contact accounts for 76-79% of HIV diagnoses among 16-19 year old males, although less is known about the actual prevalence of HIV and related health issues in this population. Disparities also exist in preparedness to prevent HIV among young men who have sex with men (YMSM), with no proven intervention for adolescents in this vulnerable group. The epidemic of HIV among YMSM does not exist in a vacuum. Instead, YMSM experience multiple psychosocial health disparities, including elevated rates of illicit drug use, exposure to violence, and mental health problems such as suicidality. Recent evidence indicates that these health issues represent intertwined epidemics that each contribute to HIV risk among YMSM, a situation referred to as a syndemic. Building on our own research with YMSM, as well as other high risk youth, we are proposing to investigate a syndemic of psychosocial health issues linked to HIV among YMSM ages 16-20. This syndemic includes HIV risk, drug use, internalizing mental health problems, and violence exposure. The overarching goals of this study are twofold: 1) to provide much-needed epidemiological data on the prevalence of HIV and related health issues in order to inform public health priorities; and 2) to collect vital information on risk and protective factors to inform the development of an intervention targeting this vulnerable population. We will accomplish these goals with three primary specific aims: (1) Ascertain the prevalence and clustering of a syndemic of biopsychosocial health problems among YMSM. We will: (a) Recruit a representative sample of 450 ethnically diverse YMSM using Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS); (b) Assess the syndemic components using state-of-the-art approaches; (c) Use the RDS model to calculate unbiased estimators of the prevalence of syndemic components; (d) Test for the clustering of syndemic components. (2) Characterize multiple trajectories of syndemic development by following our YMSM sample longitudinally over a two year period. We will: (a) Assess youth every 6 months during the transition from late adolescence to emerging adulthood, to explore the natural history of syndemic development. (b) Use growth-mixture modeling to characterize groups of youth with different trajectory classes of syndemic development in order to allow for early identification of youth most at risk of HIV acquisition. (3) Determine the importance of YMSM-specific factors in syndemic development so as to guide the development of culturally-relevant HIV prevention interventions for our target population. We will: (a) Test the value of YMSM-specific factors as predictors of trajectory class; (b) Test the incremental value of our theoretical syndemic model for predicting HIV-related sexual risk relative to the IMB model. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) are at elevated risk for a syndemic of biopsychosocial health problems. This syndemic includes HIV risk, substance use, internalizing mental health problems, and violence exposure.

"PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative (MARI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Rates of HIV infection are increasing among heterosexual young adult Black men. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advancing HIV prevention agenda calls for intervention through voluntary counseling and testing. However, young adults are less likely to be tested for HIV than older age groups and there are still large numbers of Black heterosexual men who do not get HIV tested. A goal of the study is to build HIV prevention research capacity in Black communities in which little research has been conducted. We will conduct qualitative interviews with 20 low income heterosexual young adult Black (non-Hispanic) men (ages 18-25 years) to examine barriers and facilitators to HIV testing and elicit their opinions of how to promote HIV testing among their peers. Based on the results from the qualitative interviews, a questionnaire will be developed to identify attitudes towards HIV testing, perceptions of HIV risk, socio-cultural influences (e.g., incarceration history, and male gender norms), and their relationship to HIV testing behaviors among low income heterosexual young adult Black men. Results from both the qualitative interviews and survey will be used to develop tailored educational materials that promote HIV testing among low income young adult heterosexual Black men. Three focus groups will then be conducted with low income heterosexual young adult men to evaluate the acceptability of the materials. Findings will increase our understanding of factors that influence HIV testing among Black heterosexual young adult men. In addition, HIV testing promotion materials developed through this study may have utility in increasing the number of heterosexual Black young adult men who get tested and therefore become aware of their HIV status. This proposal seeks to identify factors that influence HIV testing among low income heterosexual young adult Black men. The study will also develop tailored educational materials to promote HIV testing among this population. Specifically tailoring HIV testing messages for low income heterosexual young adult Black men may have utility in increasing the numbers among this population who get tested and therefore become aware of their HIV status. Therefore, this information may make a significant contribution to HIV prevention efforts and addresses a public health priority that fits with the goals of the US Department of Health and Human Services Healthy People 2010 initiative to eliminate health disparities related to HIV.           ","PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative (MARI)",7685341,U01PS000676,[''],NCHHSTP,ST.

"Longitudinal Analysis of Transactional Sex, Violence & HIV/HSV2 in South Africa    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In South Africa, an estimated 18% of the entire population age 15-49 is HIV positive, including approximately 10% of young women aged 15-24; this epidemic is driven almost entirely by heterosexual transmission. One key dynamic affecting heterosexual HIV transmission in South Africa, particularly among young people, is financial and material exchange as an underlying motive for sexual relationships. Often referred to as transactional sex, such exchange can be an incentive for women to have sex in situations where they might otherwise refrain, and has been noted as a potential source of women's vulnerability to gender- based violence and sexual exploitation. Research with young South African men has highlighted associations between transactional sex and perpetration of both sexual assault and intimate partner violence. Transactional sex is also associated with a range of other behaviors, such as multiple and concurrent sexual partnerships and sex while intoxicated, that carry potential for increased risk of HIV infection. In South Africa, transactional sex and gender-based violence have both been associated with prevalent HIV infection in cross-sectional studies, underscoring the importance to HIV prevention of better understanding these linked phenomena. Because research on transactional sex, gender-based violence, and HIV risk has to date been only cross-sectional, our understanding of possible causal associations and potential points of intervention remains severely limited. The recently completed Stepping Stones HIV prevention trial (5R01MH064882-04; 3R01MH064882-04S2) offers a unique opportunity to explore associations between transactional sex, gender-based violence, and incident HIV and HSV-2 infection through secondary analysis of longitudinal data from a large HIV prevention trial with youth in the rural Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Assess whether experience (for women) or perpetration (for men) of gender-based violence predicts participation in transactional sex over 24 months of follow-up among 1,252 young, rural South African women and 1,179 young, rural South African men who participated in the Stepping Stones trial and for whom follow-up data is available; (2) Assess whether participation in transactional sex predicts experience/perpetration of gender- based violence among rural South African youth over 24 months of follow-up; (3) Assess whether participation in transactional sex predicts incident HIV or HSV-2 infection over 24 months of follow-up among 1,126 young rural South African women and 1,130 young rural South African men who participated in the Stepping Stones study and have viral incidence data available; and (4) Assess whether experience or perpetration of gender- based violence predicts incident HIV or HSV-2 infection over 24 months of follow-up among rural South African youth. This study will answer key questions about the role of transactional sex and gender-based violence in shaping young people's risk of HIV infection and inform future interventions to reduce the risk of both HIV and gender-based violence among African youth.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: South Africa has the highest number of HIV infected individuals in the world, with an epidemic driven by heterosexual transmission and reinforced by high incidence of gender-based violence and inequality. Young people who are just becoming sexually active represent both a pool of extreme vulnerability and a potentially valuable point for interventions for prevent both HIV and gender-based violence. This analyses proposed here will yield a deeper understanding of the linked role of transactional sex and gender-based violence among South African youth and the extent to which transactional sex and gender- based violence impact women's and men's risk of acquiring HIV and/or HSV-2 infection, and will thereby inform development of improved prevention interventions.           Public Health Significance: South Africa has the highest number of HIV infected individuals in the world, with an epidemic driven by heterosexual transmission and reinforced by high incidence of gender-based violence and inequality.

"Understanding Female Partners of Bisexual Men: Implications for HIV/STD Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the United States, the reported rates of new HIV diagnoses among black and Hispanic women are, respectively, 20 and 5.4 times that of white women. A greater tendency toward bisexual behavior and non-gay identification among black and Hispanic men who have sex with men (MSM) than among white MSM is thought to contribute to the large racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS observed among women; however, nearly nothing is known about the female partners of behaviorally bisexual men. Furthermore, many HIV-infected women are considered ""heterosexual unidentified risk"" because they do not fit into an HIV transmission category other than sex with a male of unidentified risk. We propose a two-phase study to better understand HIV risk among women of color by identifying predictors of sex with bisexual and unidentified risk men and exploring psychosocial issues surrounding and correlates of these sexual partnerships. This research will be carried out among African-American and Latina females recently tested for HIV in publicly funded test sites in Los Angeles County.       In Phase I, a matched case-control analysis will be carried out using secondary data to identify predictors of having had sex with a bisexual man or of being diagnosed HIV-antibody positive with unidentified heterosexual risk. In Phase II, recently tested women will be recruited and interviewed, including 30 who report bisexual male partners and 20 HIV-infected women with unidentified sexual risk. The in-depth semi-structured interview will examine psychosocial factors surrounding sexual relationships with men, including known bisexual, potentially bisexual, and presumed heterosexual men and explore (1) the range of relationship types characterizing women's relationships with these men; (2) attitudes regarding gender roles and desired partner traits; (3) how and when participants became aware of their partners' bisexual behavior and how this awareness influenced their HIV risk perception; (4) how HIV-antibody positive women with unidentified sexual risk perceive they and their partners were infected; and (5) participant's attitudes and behaviors regarding health-related research, health care, and STD/HIV prevention. Interview transcripts will be analyzed using a consensual qualitative research approach to identify major themes and generate hypotheses and survey items for a larger quantitative interview study comparing women reporting sex with a bisexual male to women who do not believe that they have had sex with a bisexual man. They will also help direct prevention resources and guide HIV prevention intervention approaches among women of color.          ",Understanding Female Partners of Bisexual Men: Implications for HIV/STD Risk ,7627218,SC3GM083780,"['Demographic Factors ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Transcript ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' Female ', ' Affect ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Age ', ' Bisexual ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' resource guides ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Categories ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' County ', ' risk perception ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Color ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' safer sex ', ' stem ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' Psychosocial Influences ', ' Psychosocial Issues ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' Conservatism ', ' sexual relationship ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Collaborations ', ' Anal Sex ', ' Oral Sex ', ' permissiveness ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' self esteem ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Social Desirability ', ' Social Desirabilities ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Awareness ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' ']",NIGMS,CHARLES R.

"A Brief, Clinic-Based, HIV Prevention Program for African American Teen Males    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has declared that AIDS is a ""state of emergency"" in the US relative to African Americans. Teen males attending STD clinics are one important, yet often neglected, population of African Americans at risk of HIV acquisition. Despite extremely high rates of STD acquisition (and subsequent infection) among this population, effective clinic-based interventions specifically designed to reduce their sexual risk behavior for STD/HIV have not been developed/disseminated. A recent intervention trial (conducted by Dr. Crosby) demonstrated the efficacy of a brief, clinic-based, intervention designed to prevent subsequent STI acquisition among African American males 18 to 29 years of age. The proposed study will test the efficacy this intervention (in modified form) to reduce STI incidence among African American teen (15 to 20 years old). The primary hypothesis is that teens randomized to receive the intervention will have a lower incidence rate of laboratory-confirmed STIs at 2 and 6-month follow-up assessments (as well as 12-month follow-up conducted by a medical records review) compared to those receiving an attention-equivalent control condition. Teens (N = 840) will be recruited from a publicly-funded STD clinic located in an urban area of the South. After completing an A-CASI assessment, teens will be rated on their ability to apply condoms to a penile model and then asked to donate a urine specimen for STI testing. Specimens will be tested for C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and T. Vaginalis using nucleic acid amplification assays. Randomization will then be achieved by a concealment of allocation technique. Teens will be randomized to immediately receive: 1) a brief (60 minute) theory-based, one-on-one, interactive intervention delivered by a lay health advisor or 2) an attention equivalent control condition. The assessment battery will be repeated 2 months subsequent to enrollment and again 6 months after enrollment. A medical records review will be conducted 12 months after enrollment to compare clinic reported incidence rates between the randomized groups of teens. If incidence of STIs in this population of teens can be decreased as substantially as was found in the previous study of 18 to 29 year-old African American males (percent relative difference = 36.7), the public health significance for African American teen males will substantially contribute to rectify the racial disparity in HIV/STD experienced by African American teen males. By extension, we suggest that their partners (typically African American teen females) will also benefit. Because our program is designed for ease of implementation, the number of dissemination and translation issues will be greatly minimized thereby greatly facilitating the process of translating research into practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed efficacy trial tests an innovative method of bridging the gap between research and practice. By providing a brief, clinic-based, HIV/STD prevention program to African American teen males attending an STD clinic, the study will be the first to demonstrate that teen's sexual risk behavior can be reduced without excessive time and resources. The focus on African American teen males is also quite timely given the recent declaration by CDC that AIDS is a ""state of emergency"" for African Americans.          ","A Brief, Clinic-Based, HIV Prevention Program for African American Teen Males",7693779,R01MH083621,"['Health Educators ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Caring ', ' Age-Years ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Goals ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Kentucky ', ' Laboratories ', ' post intervention ', ' Funding ', ' male ', ' Medical Records ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Neisseria gonorrhoeae ', ' N.gonorrhoeae ', ' N. gonorrhoeae ', ' Gonococcus ', ' Glare ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' Perception ', ' Brothers ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Trichomonas Infections ', ' trichomoniasis ', ' Trichomonosis ', ' Disease due to Trichomonadidae ', ' Trichomonas vaginalis ', ' T. vaginalis ', ' United States ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Attention ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Clinic ', ' Upper arm ', ' Techniques ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' condoms ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' Reporting ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Chlamydia ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Instruction ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' avoid sex ', ' neglect ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 20 year old ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' safer sex ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' research to practice ', ' research into practice ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' follow up assessment ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2009,366250,0.032206087984981945
"Feasibility of recruiting nondisclosing Black MSM/W for drug use /HIV research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will investigate the feasibility of conducting ethnographic research on HIV risk among drug-using Black men who have sex with men and women but do not identify as gay or homosexual and do not disclose their same-sex activity to their female partners. Because these men do not identify as gay or homosexual, there is concern that they are not being reached by programs aimed at gay-identified communities. The specific aims are: 1) To locate and recruit for interviewing drug-using Black men who have sex with men and women (MSM/W) but do not disclose their same-sex activity to their female partners. 2) To gain a preliminary understanding of how Black MSM/W decide whether and what to disclose about their HIV risk behaviors including drug use and high risk sexual practices. Because male-to-male sexual contact is the most commonly reported HIV/AIDS transmission category among men, there is a growing body of research on MSM, including Black MSM/W. However, there appear to be no systematic investigations of patterns of drug use among Black MSM/W or on the issue of disclosing same-sex activity to female partners. There is speculation that Black MSM/W constitute a ""bridge"" population facilitating HIV infection among Black women but there is insufficient empirical evidence to substantiate the claim. The broad goal of this project is to foster further research on the relationship between drug use and HIV risk among Black adults, in order to develop a better understanding of the severe racial disparities in HIV/AIDS infection. Black men are six times more likely than White men to be infected, and Black women are 19 times as likely as White women to be infected. This project will employ two ethnographers to recruit men through four sources: 1) existing social networks established in our previous research in low-income, high-HIV neighborhoods; 2) known MSM venues such as clubs, bars, parks and street locations; 3) Internet sites and 4) groups and organizations serving drug users and ex-offenders. Five small focus groups at two points in the study will help to enhance our recruitment strategy and shape lines of inquiry regarding decisions to conceal or disclose behavior. Ethnographers will also cultivate relationships with and conduct individual interviews with 30 men to obtain preliminary insights into drug use and MSM activity, knowledge and management of HIV risk and factors influencing disclosure decisions. If the proposed feasibility study yields a successful strategy for recruiting and interviewing Black MSM/W, it can be incorporated into a subsequent larger effort (an R01) designed to collect more extensive data that can inform appropriate risk-reduction interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This feasibility study is designed to improve research on HIV risk and protective factors among drug-involved men who have sex with men and women. The study is focused on Black men who do not identify as gay or homosexual and do not disclose their same-sex activity to their female partners. Because these men do not identify as gay or homosexual, they may not be reached by prevention programs aimed at gay-identified communities. This study will identify successful strategies for recruiting and interviewing these men, with the longer-term goals of generating knowledge that can contribute to more effective interventions that may ultimately reduce racial disparities in HIV/AIDS.           Public Health Relevance Statement This feasibility study is designed to improve research on HIV risk and protective factors among drug-involved men who have sex with men and women.

"HIV Prevention for High Risk African American Young Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is being submitted in response to the NIH's Program Announcement entitled, ""Health Disparities in HIV/AIDS: Focus on African Americans"" (PA-07-289), which recognizes that ""African Americans [represent] a group that has experienced exceptionally high rates of new HIV infections and worse survival rates than other ethnic/racial groups in this country"" A particular focus of this program announcement is the development of ""theoretically based, developmentally appropriate, and culturally sensitive HIV preventive interventions targeting individual, social, and environmental factors for vulnerable African-American populations (e.g., men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers, youth)."" The specific aims of this R21 application are to: 1) adapt an effective, evidence-based intervention called Project AIM (Adult Identity Mentoring) so that it is developmentally appropriate and culturally relevant for use with African-American (AA) young men who have sex with men (YMSM) in Los Angeles; 2) pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of the new intervention that we will call Young Men's AIM (YM-AIM); and 3) identify barriers and facilitators with respect to implementing YM-AIM in community settings. Data from our own Healthy Young Men's (HYM) Study provides strong evidence that AAYMSM are significantly more likely to have experienced racial discrimination and to report significantly higher levels of internalized homophobia than Latino and Caucasian YMSM. AAYMSM are also significantly more likely to experience various forms of violence and victimization, including homophobia, when growing up, sexual/social discrimination based on race, and institutional racism relative to Caucasian and Latino YMSM. These experiences of racism, homophobia, and violence were in turn found to be significantly associated with illicit drug use, alcohol misuse, and involvement in HIV sexual risk behaviors. These and other findings emphasize the need for prevention interventions that are tailored to meet the unique needs and risk profiles of AAYMSM. In this study, we are proposing to adapt an existing HIV prevention intervention called Project AIM for use with 18-24 year old AAYMSM. Project AIM is an effective, evidence-based intervention with demonstrated short- and long-term increases in sexual abstinence and reductions in sexual activity among African-American adolescent males. Drawing upon the Theory of Possible Selves, Project AIM seeks to steer adolescents away from risky behavioral choices by offering alternative avenues to define themselves as adults. Findings from our HYM study, including findings from mixed-methods research conducted with a cohort of 126 AAYMSM (ages 18 to 24 years), will inform the adaptation of Project AIM. We will also engage and solicit input from AAYMSM and local youth service providers. Once adapted, the new intervention (YM-AIM) will be pilot tested to determine its feasibility and acceptability and to identify barriers and facilitators with respect to implementing YM-AIM in community settings.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Rates of HIV infections continue to rise among African American young men who have sex with men, and yet it remains the case that few prevention interventions have been developed specifically for this population. We are proposing to adapt and pilot test the Adolescent Identity Mentoring (AIM) intervention, an evidence-based prevention intervention that has previously been found to be effective with younger high-risk African American youth.          ",HIV Prevention for High Risk African American Young Men,7563928,R21DA024588,"['Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' suspension ', ' Suspension substance ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' sex ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' adolescent boy ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' racism ', ' Infection ', ' Ensure ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' sexual relationship ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Los Angeles ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex abstinence ', ' not sexually active ', ' celibate ', ' abstaining from sex ', ' abstain from sexual intercouse ', ' abstain from sexual activity ', ' abstain from intercouse ', ' Celibacy ', ' Sexual Abstinence ', ' Social Discrimination ', ' Victimization ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Suspensions ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Country ', ' Behavior ', ' meetings ', ' middle school ', ' Services ', ' transsexual ', ' transgender ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' response ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Coitus ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' unhealthy alcohol use ', ' ethanol misuse ', ' alcohol misuse ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' surveillance study ', ' ']",NIDA,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R21,2009,118125,0.03914307482408356
"Implicit Status Communication & Management: Physiological & Social Costs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite gender equity in many professions, men continue to dominate in leadership. Although just as effective as male leaders, women leaders (WLs) may experience unique challenges that undermine their health. Why? Prejudice against women in leadership persists. Women develop within social institutions ill-equipped to foster their leadership skills. The need for a more complete understanding of how women ""do"" leadership motivated the proposed research. The focus is on the implicit, non-conscious communication of status. Research has shown that during a communication task, men in lower status roles (followers) converge non-conscious aspects of their speech toward men in higher status roles (leaders), whose speech does not change. Because behavioral mimicry elicits liking, such an asymmetrical pattern is consistent with a defensive response to being in a subservient role. However, mimicry is also predicted by perspective taking ability. Unexpectedly, in the same communication task, WLs converge their speech toward followers (Pardo, 2006). Thus this task can potentially provide a window into gender differences in the implicit communication of status. It is unclear whether WLs' convergence is a social threat response (akin to men in the subservient role) or evidence of heightened social skills. To address this puzzle, the proposed research uses an established communication paradigm, during which pre-, post-, and during-interaction speech is recorded. Participants (Ps) complete a collaborative task in either the Leader or Follower role. Listeners judge the speech samples to establish how much each P's speech converges toward the partner. Three studies will address the following questions with students at a university (50 percent female) that emphasizes educating future leaders: (a) Are prior findings of gender differences in implicit speech convergence robust? (b) What does convergence imply for partner's assessment of one's likeability and competence and for partner's affiliative behavior? Does convergence by WLs increase their likeability but reduce estimates of their competence? (c) Is convergence exaggerated or muted among WLs when their identity as female leaders is situationally threatened or when they are dispositionally concerned about gender-based rejection? (d) Is convergence predicted by a physiological pattern of threat? Do gender and status moderate the pattern? (e) What are the physiological and psychological consequences of one's convergence? Does this depend on gender and status? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By examining gender differences in implicit communication of status, the research may help clarify why leadership may be more costly to women's health than to men's.           ",Implicit Status Communication & Management: Physiological & Social Costs,7616378,F31HD060418,"['Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Behavioral ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Affect ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' Health ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Intelligence ', ' Training ', ' Judgment ', ' Laws ', ' Leadership ', ' mimicry ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Individual ', ' London ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Americas ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Prejudice ', ' Attenuated ', ' Shapes ', ' Productivity ', ' Anxiety ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Social Interaction ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Arousal ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Dimensions ', ' Awareness ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior ', ' interest ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' Capital ', ' Social status ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Fortune ', ' Censuses ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' psychological distress ', ' Competence ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Communication ', ' cost ', ' affiliative behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' lexical ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NICHD,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,F31,2009,36342,0.03978818947177713
"Gender Identity and HIV Risk II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a revised submission for a 5-year competitive continuation to grant 1R01-DA015269, Gender Identity and HIV Risk. The long-range goal of our research is to reduce HIV transmission among individuals stigmatized for their gender nonconformity and diversity, a goal consistent with the Healthy People 2010 objective to reduce the nation's health disparities. Key findings from our prior work were: a) a national sample of these individuals can be effectively reached via the Internet; b) differences in sex, gender identity/role, and sexual orientation are associated with important differences in HIV risk behavior; c) individuals in the female role are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection through the high risk behavior of the men with whom they interact. We propose to build on these findings by investigating the HIV risk behavior and cofactors of this population's high risk male partners (N=400), using online survey and interview methods successfully applied in the original project (Aim 1). These results will help inform the development of a theory- driven, Internet-based, HIV prevention intervention for individuals who are stigmatized for their gender non- conformity (Aim 2). The intervention will be modeled on an offline HIV intervention shown, in an uncontrolled trial, to reduce risk behavior in the target population. After user-testing and refinement of the prototype online intervention, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial (N=600) to evaluate its efficacy in improving health and reducing HIV risk behavior (Aim 3). This study is innovative in that a) few interventions exist for this minority population and even fewer have been adequately evaluated; b) the intervention will combine HIV prevention and behavior change theories with principles of e-learning; c) the entire study will be implemented online. Our team is highly experienced in HIV prevention research with diverse and vulnerable populations, the benefits/challenges of Internet-based research (online recruitment, data collection, intervention adaptation), and sexual health theory and measures. The project has public health significance in that the minority population targeted for intervention is at high risk for HIV infection, and the men with whom they interact not only pose a risk to them, but also to the general population. If proven effective, the online intervention can be implemented with little additional cost to reduce gender-related HIV risks on a large scale, nationally and internationally, even among highly stigmatized groups.           ",Gender Identity and HIV Risk II,7619071,R01HD057595,"['Data Collection ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Female ', ' Prevention education ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' base ', ' cofactor ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Area ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Learning ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Respondent ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Play ', ' Companions ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' instrument ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' self esteem ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Silicones ', ' Stigmata ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' transgender ', ' transsexual ', ' Body Image ', ' body perception ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' high risk behavior ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Role "", ' Female Roles ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' safer sex ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' satisfaction ', ' male ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2009,640263,0.012674160682738618
"Self-Silencing and African-American and Latina Women's HIV Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Understanding factors that contribute to African American and Latina women's elevated levels of HIV risk is a research area urgently in need of attention. The proposed research fills this gap by investigating the gendered and cultural factors that contribute to African-American and Latina women's sexual risk-taking behaviors. The proposed research will investigate the role of self- silencing (i.e., the extent to which women inhibit their self-expression to create and maintain valued interpersonal relationships) in sexual risk-taking using secondary data analysis of a four- wave, 18-month longitudinal study of 512 African American and Latina women (ages 18-67) in the greater San Francisco Bay Area. The three specific aims of the study are: (1) to test self- silencing as a predictor of women's sexual risk-taking behaviors (i.e., engaging in vaginal and anal intercourse without the use of a condom), developing separate models for African- American and Latina women; (2) to examine intrapersonal mechanisms (i.e., self-esteem, condom use self-efficacy, and sexual comfort) and interpersonal mechanisms (i.e., perceived negative relational consequences of condom use and perceived relationship power) through which self-silencing may contribute to women's sexual risk-taking; and (3) to examine the potential moderating roles of socioeconomic status and age on the association between self- silencing and sexual risk-taking. Distinct statistical modeling techniques (i.e., multivariate latent growth curve modeling and multi-group analysis) will be used to address the three specific aims. The proposed research will deepen our understanding of the factors that contribute to the staggering racial/ethnic disparities in HIV and other sexually transmitted infections among women. Self-Silencing and African-American and Latina Women's HIV Risk Behaviors Project Narrative While African American and Latina women combined represent less than a quarter of all women in the United States, they account for over three-quarters of newly identified HIV infections in women. The proposed research will deepen our understanding of the gendered and cultural factors that contribute to the staggering racial/ethnic disparities in HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Findings will guide educators and health care providers wishing to promote behavioral change in the women who are disproportionately affected by these infections.          ",Self-Silencing and African-American and Latina Women's HIV Risk,7674671,R03HD059306,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Address ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Behavioral ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Area ', ' Infection ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' self esteem ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Attention ', ' Woman ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Gender ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Accounting ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NICHD,SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2009,76750,0.05754181698893455
"Reducing Sexual Risk Behaviors among Rural African-American Cocaine Users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV and other sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates continue to rise disproportionately among African-Americans, and particularly dramatically among rural populations. Stimulant use, especially cocaine use, among rural African-Americans is also increasing, and is related to multiple risk behaviors for HIV/STI, including sex with multiple partners, exchanging sex for drugs and other commodities, and inconsistent condom use. Despite these documented risk patterns, and the increasing disparities in HIV/STI incidence, few theory-based interventions have been specifically designed and tested for rural African-American populations with high-risk behavioral patterns. The primary aims of this project are to adapt an existing risk reduction program to the needs of rural African-American cocaine users, to test the adapted intervention's efficacy via a behavioral clinical trial, and to answer outstanding questions regarding intraclass correlation and sampling methodologies in the sexual risk reduction literature. The project team will conduct a longitudinal intervention study with stratified group randomization, so that participants receive the sexual risk intervention or an active control intervention condition in groups. Each intervention condition is equivalent in terms of contact time and in terms of number and type of contacts (each participant receives two group sessions, two individual sessions, two community-building sessions, and two follow-up ""booster"" sessions over four months). Respondent-driven sampling will be used to recruit and enroll 280 participants across two rural, predominantly African-American counties in the Arkansas Delta region to one of the two intervention conditions. The primary outcome variables will include condom use skills, sexual negotiation skills, and self-reported risk behaviors. Additional measures, including self-efficacy for decreased sexual risk, perceived peer norms for sexual risk, perceived benefits and barriers of sexual risk reduction, social support and social trust, mental health status, partner violence, and substance use, will also be collected to assess their theory-based mediating and moderating influences on the sexual risk skills and behaviors. Assessments will be conducted prior to the intervention, immediately post-intervention, and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. This project brings together a strong, experienced investigative team which has an established, trusting relationship with the community that will be involved in the study.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The project not only will provide critically-needed information about the efficacy of tailored behavioral interventions among rural African-Americans at high risk for HIV/STIs, but also will allow the study team to investigate important methodological questions about the use of respondent- driven sampling approaches in rural settings and about intraclass correlation coefficients for sexual risk measures in tight-knit rural communities. This research can thus make important contributions that address racial disparities in HIV/STIs, provide approaches for slowing the rapid growth of the epidemics in rural areas, and inform methodological innovations of importance to sexual risk reduction science.          ",Reducing Sexual Risk Behaviors among Rural African-American Cocaine Users,7674804,R01DA024575,"['Risk Reduction

"Understanding Female Partners of Bisexual Men: Implications for HIV/STD Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the United States, the reported rates of new HIV diagnoses among black and Hispanic women are, respectively, 20 and 5.4 times that of white women. A greater tendency toward bisexual behavior and non-gay identification among black and Hispanic men who have sex with men (MSM) than among white MSM is thought to contribute to the large racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS observed among women; however, nearly nothing is known about the female partners of behaviorally bisexual men. Furthermore, many HIV-infected women are considered ""heterosexual unidentified risk"" because they do not fit into an HIV transmission category other than sex with a male of unidentified risk. We propose a two-phase study to better understand HIV risk among women of color by identifying predictors of sex with bisexual and unidentified risk men and exploring psychosocial issues surrounding and correlates of these sexual partnerships. This research will be carried out among African-American and Latina females recently tested for HIV in publicly funded test sites in Los Angeles County.       In Phase I, a matched case-control analysis will be carried out using secondary data to identify predictors of having had sex with a bisexual man or of being diagnosed HIV-antibody positive with unidentified heterosexual risk. In Phase II, recently tested women will be recruited and interviewed, including 30 who report bisexual male partners and 20 HIV-infected women with unidentified sexual risk. The in-depth semi-structured interview will examine psychosocial factors surrounding sexual relationships with men, including known bisexual, potentially bisexual, and presumed heterosexual men and explore (1) the range of relationship types characterizing women's relationships with these men; (2) attitudes regarding gender roles and desired partner traits; (3) how and when participants became aware of their partners' bisexual behavior and how this awareness influenced their HIV risk perception; (4) how HIV-antibody positive women with unidentified sexual risk perceive they and their partners were infected; and (5) participant's attitudes and behaviors regarding health-related research, health care, and STD/HIV prevention. Interview transcripts will be analyzed using a consensual qualitative research approach to identify major themes and generate hypotheses and survey items for a larger quantitative interview study comparing women reporting sex with a bisexual male to women who do not believe that they have had sex with a bisexual man. They will also help direct prevention resources and guide HIV prevention intervention approaches among women of color.

"African American Young Mens Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised application is being resubmitted in response to the National Institutes of Health's Program Announcement entitled, ""Health Disparities in HIV/AIDS: Focus on African Americans"" (PA-06-069, reissued as PA-07-116), which recognizes that ""African Americans [represent] a group that has experienced exceptionally high rates of new HIV infections and worse survival rates than other ethnic/racial groups in this country."" To be sure, as we are now in the third decade of the HIV epidemic, African American men who have sex with men remain disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the US. Perhaps the most hidden segment of this population are African American young men who have sex with men (AAYMSM), who now represent the largest proportion of new infections among men who have sex with men (MSM). Though HIV prevention efforts using bar settings or community-based organizations targeting the gay community have been met with success, research indicates that many at-risk AAYMSM do not frequent these venues. Instead, large numbers of AAYMSM can be reached through the Ball and House communities. The Ball community revolves around collectives called ""Houses,"" which are racial, ethnic, and sexual minority defined communities that are characterized by groups of young men who create a family structure with an appointed ""mother,"" ""father"" and other members called ""the children."" The Houses offer members a network of friends and a place to turn to for support, positive affirming norms, collective identity, and connectedness among AAYMSM. Often young men join a House after having been rejected by their own family. The Balls, which are held several times a month, are lavish celebrations/competitions that serve as a social event for MSM of color, particularly AAYMSM. Our own research suggests that the Ball and House communities could be ideal settings in which to conduct HIV prevention research with AAYMSM. We are therefore proposing to conduct ethnographic and survey research to better understand and examine: 1) the structural, social, and cultural characteristics of the Ball and House communities; 2) Ball and House members' use of illicit drugs and involvement in HIV risk and protective behaviors, and their social and sexual networks; and 3) the role that rejection, discrimination, and internalized homophobia play with respect to encouraging drug use and HIV risk.

"HIV Risk among Male Parolees and their Female Partners    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects prisoners in the United States. Women of color and low-income women in the United States also have disproportionately high rates of HIV infection and AIDS diagnosis. Recent studies have shown that racial disparities in incarceration can be linked to health disparities, including disparities in HIV/AIDS. Research exploring how the disproportionate levels of HIV/AIDS among incarcerated men and among low-income women of color are related is crucial. The proposed study will be conducted with both members of male-female couples in which the male partner was recently released from prison and is under parole supervision (""male parolees""). The specific aims of the proposed study are: 1) Using quantitative methods, we will assess the HIV-risk behaviors of each member of the couple and identify individual-level and couple-level psychosocial influences on HIV risk and risk reduction; 2) Using qualitative methods, we will describe the unique influence of the context of a man's incarceration on couples' decision-making processes involving HIV risk and risk reduction; 3) Using quantitative and qualitative methods, we will investigate how males' and females' perspectives on HIV risk and risk reduction influence both their own behavior and behavior within the couple. Our preliminary studies have underscored the complexities of understanding how the context of a man's incarceration influences couples' decision-making processes involving HIV risk and risk reduction and have compelled us to undertake couple-level research on this issue. Public-health researchers have identified the necessity of developing and providing population-specific HIV interventions and services for people affected by incarceration both in prison and in their home neighborhoods post-release. The proposed research will yield critical information about HIV risk and risk reduction in dyadic relationships between male parolees and their female partners that can be used to develop population-appropriate and effective interventions for the millions of low-income people of color who experience their own or their partner's incarceration each year.           ",HIV Risk among Male Parolees and their Female Partners,7624289,R01MH078743,"['Couples ', ' Decision Making ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Dreams ', ' dreaming ', ' Low income ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Process ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Left ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Link ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Gender Relations ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Prisoner ', ' jail inmate ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' Prisons ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' programs ', ' Supervision ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' parolee ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' parole ', ' Emotional ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Color ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' service intervention ', ' Psychosocial Influences ', ' Psychosocial Issues ', ' effective intervention ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' information gathering ', ' experience ', ' AIDS diagnosis ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2009,389681,0.02642058589971276
"Implicit Associations and Shifting Self-Definitions Across Work and Family Roles    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As social scientists, we know quite a lot about current trends regarding differential career and family outcomes for men versus women. The purpose of the current studies is to understand how ingrained cultural expectations regarding gender role distributions combine with efforts to view the self as competent and efficacious, fulfilling core roles that produce a sense of belonging and acceptance, to determine decisions regarding work and family. We argue that an asymmetry exists for the genders such that for men, fulfilling their role as a successful professional simultaneously fulfills the role of successful father. In contrast, for women the roles are in direct conflict. Performing the behavior required for mastery in the professional world necessarily detracts from performing that required for success as a mom. As a result, women who value both roles are required to shift their self-concepts when considering their goals in one role versus the other. We argue this shifting produces a sense of conflict that may contribute to women eventually choosing one identity over the other. The studies in this application examine the feasibility of this analysis by measuring implicit shifts in self- definitions and predicting these as a function of participant gender, identification with the roles, and the strength of implicit role associations pairing women with childcare and men with the professional world. Male and female students in the first two years of graduate and professional training are recruited from five different disciplines that vary in the proportion of males that make up the discipline. Men are argued to enjoy a more consistent definition of the self across the two roles and the more traditional the role associations held by an individual male, the more true this should be, perhaps resulting in even greater differences in experienced shifts in self-definitions by the genders in more male dominated fields. The greater shifts experienced by women are hypothesized to have immediate costs in cognitive functioning, state anxiety, and work-family balance self-efficacy, and over time to generate stress, depression, and lower life satisfaction, at least in the early stages of developing one's identity in the parent and professional domains. The dual roles may provide a buffer to women against threats to the self once a secure identity in each role has been established. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The past 50 years have witnessed unprecedented changes in the organization of the family with the mass entry of women into the workforce, significantly smaller family sizes, soaring divorce rates, and an increased number of single parent families. Family structure has profound implications for the well-being of individual family members and consequently, public health more generally. Understanding efforts to balance career and parenting roles in the service of preserving a sense of self-worth is a fundamental component of constructing healthy family units.           The past 50 years have witnessed unprecedented changes in the organization of the family with the mass entry of women into the workforce, significantly smaller family sizes, soaring divorce rates, and an increased number of single parent families.

"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Fall Risk and Bone Strength Among Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The changing shape of the U.S. population age structure will dramatically increase the number of osteoporotic fractures in the elderly; the increase will disproportionately affect minorities and men. It is therefore important to understand the epidemiology of osteoporosis in these populations. While there are clear racial/ethnic differences in fracture rates, their origins are not understood. The proposed study will be a comprehensive effort to further our understanding of the fundamental causes of racial/ethnic disparities in fracture rates by focusing on markers of two primary `upstream' determinants of fracture: falls and bone fragility. The Boston Area Community Health/Bone (BACH/Bone) Survey is a study of skeletal health in a randomly selected group of 1,219 black, Hispanic, and white men between 29-80 y. BACH/Bone staff have been very productive, producing over 10 papers for peer-reviewed journals. We propose a second wave of data collection on ~825 men to begin ~6.5 y after baseline, when the cohort will be between 35-86 y. The Specific Aims of the proposed study are to, in a racially/ethnically diverse, population-based sample of men: 1) Estimate longitudinal changes in markers of bone strength and fall risk, with and without adjustment for known risk factors; 2) Determine the relative contributions of social factors, individual risk behaviors and health status, and physiological influences to racial/ethnic differences in markers of fall risk and bone strength; 3) Establish the first age- and racial/ethnic group-specific, population-based estimates of bone microarchitecture, and identify determinants of observed age and racial/ethnic differences; 4) Determine whether there are age and racial/ethnic differences in the ratio of bone loads to bone strength (the `factor of risk'); 5) Examine whether genetic ancestry contributes to variations in markers of fall risk and bone strength beyond that attributable to self-identified race/ethnicity. The representativeness and racial/ethnic diversity of the BACH/Bone cohort are unique, and, as such, the potential impact of the study is enormous. By focusing upstream on markers of fall risk and bone strength with state-of-the-art measures, it will make landmark contributions to our understanding of the elusive mechanisms underlying racial/ethnic differences in bone fragility. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Boston Area Community Health/Bone Survey is an observational research study examining the complex relationships between aging, social structure, health and lifestyle, hormones, genetic factors, and markers of fall risk as well as bone strength in a population-based sample of racially/ethnically diverse aging men.

"Disparities in Lung and Colorectal Cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific segments of the population bear a greater cancer burden than the general population. It has been hypothesized that sexual minorities are among the population groups likely to experience cancer disparities. However, in the absence of reliable population-based data that include sexual orientation, this hypothesis has yet to be tested. This secondary data analysis will link two data sources, SEER and the US Census, to assess if sexual minorities are unequally affected by cancer. Using a county-level proxy for sexual orientation, we will test the hypothesis that geographic areas in which sexual minorities (defined as same-sex partnered households) are concentrated have higher lung and colorectal cancer incidence, more advanced stage at diagnosis, and greater cancer mortality compared to areas with few sexual minority women. A secondary goal is to consider the economic structure of the geographic areas in which sexual minorities live so that any disparities in the cancer burden are appropriately attributed. We have four specific aims to identify lung and colorectal cancer disparities: 1. Examine the relationship of lung cancer incidence to the percentage of sexual minority populations (defined as female or male same-sex partnered households) in a geographic area and examine the relationship of colorectal cancer incidence to the percentage of SMW. 2. Determine the rate of late stage lung cancer diagnoses to the percentage of sexual minority populations in a geographic area and determine the rate of late stage colorectal cancer diagnoses to the percentage of SMW. 3. Compare lung cancer mortality as a function of percentage of sexual minority populations in a geographic area and compare colorectal cancer mortality as a function of percentage of SMW in a geographic area. 4. Compare lung cancer incidence, stage of diagnosis, and mortality in the geographic areas where sexual minority populations are concentrated as a function of per capita income in these areas and compare colorectal cancer incidence, stage of diagnosis, and mortality in the geographic areas where SMW are concentrated as a function of per capita income in these areas.           Project Narrative Results from this study will show whether sexual minorities are a vulnerable population for lung and colorectal cancers. If this innovative data use is successful, it can be replicated for other population groups that are not well described in existing cancer surveillance databases.

"Syndemic Production among Emergent Adult Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent trends in U.S. urban centers indicate a rise in the number of new HIV infections in the population of young men who have sex with men (YMSM). These trends suggest a high level of vulnerability to HIV seroconversion in YMSM through sexual behavior as they emerge into adulthood. In addition, acts of sexual risk taking in this population often function synergistically with illicit drug use, and mental health burden. Despite some success with HIV prevention in the MSM population during the last 25 years, these recent patterns suggest that a reexamination of our prevention strategies for this population, especially for YMSM of color, is needed. Given the interplay that exists between unprotected sexual behavior, illicit drug use, and mental health burden, all such efforts must consider how these overlapping epidemics (also known as syndemics) fuel each other in a cohort of YMSM as they emerge into adulthood. Thus, we will we will initiate a prospective longitudinal program of research to follow the development of syndemics in a racially/ethnically and economically diverse cohort of urban HIV-negative YMSM in New York City as they transition from adolescence into young adulthood, and apply, test, and further develop a theory of syndemic production to understand the development of both maladaptive and adaptive behavioral outcomes. Specifically we seek to (1) develop and test theoretically informed measurement models of the covariance of illicit drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and mental health burden among emergent adult HIV-negative YMSM within and across time, (2) assess whether patterns of behavior are continuous, discontinuous, or some combination of both; (3) delineate the risk and protective bases-physical factors (i.e., pubertal onset, HIV status), relational factors (i.e., family history of psychopathology, current romantic relationships, peer support, and characteristics of residential, social, and sex neighborhoods), and psychosocial factors (i.e., sexual identity, internalized homophobia, hypermasculinity, racial identity, racial devaluation, HIV optimism) that predict the development of syndemics, and (4) determine the extent to which the development of syndemics varies by race/ethnicity, social class, and homelessness/housing stability in a cohort of HIV-negative YMSM. Using multiple measurement modalities, which include biological assays, calendar based methods, and self-reports, we will follow the development of 675, 18-year-old HIV-negative YMSM. Participants will be recruited through venue-based and respondent driven sampling, as they emerge into adulthood, over seven waves of data collection within a 36-month time frame. We will utilize Structural Equation and Latent Growth Curve Analysis to answer our four main research questions.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to understand why a new generation of young men who have sex with other men place themselves at risk for HIV transmission. Knowledge which we will generate will help us understand how these young men emerge into adulthood, the choices they make about sexual behavior and illicit drug use, as well as how these two behaviors interact with their mental health. We seek to understand why some men exhibit risky behaviors as they emerge into adulthood while others do not. Working with community and municipal partners, we will draw from what we have learned from both groups to develop strategies for HIV prevention and intervention that are relevant to this current and developing generation who did not live through the devastation of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980's. In addition, we will add to the methodological literature based on our analysis of nested latent growth curve models.           RELEVANCE The goal of this project is to understand why a new generation of young men who have sex with other men place themselves at risk for HIV transmission.

"Reducing HIV Disparities: Sexual Concurrency Communication for HIV Prevention amo    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on different racial/ethnic groups remains one of the most extreme examples of a racial disparity in health among Americans. HIV infection is significantly higher among non-Hispanic blacks than among any other racial/ethnic group in the United States. There is now evidence that sexual network dynamics, including overlapping sexual partnerships (concurrency) play an important role in racial disparities in HIV. Due to structural factors, including highly disproportionate incarceration rates, African- Americans are more likely to be in sexual networks where people have more concurrent sexual partners. Mathematical models show that achieving very small reductions in levels of sexual concurrency can have a dramatic impact on the chain of HIV transmission. Our Community Action Board (CAB) of the Center for AIDS & STD Working Group on Disparities has prioritized developing health communication messages about sexual networks to help reduce HIV stigma and transmission in communities of African heritage. In this research, we will utilize community-based participatory research methods to translate the science of sexual networks into culturally-resonant HIV prevention messages as a new approach to help reduce racial disparities in HIV. Aim 1: Undertake formative research to develop HIV prevention messages that convey the importance of sexual network dynamics in King County, Washington. The CAB Disparities Working Group will conduct focus groups and interviews with a) native-born African-Americans and b) foreign-born blacks (Ethiopian and Kenyan immigrants, who are the majority of incident HIV among foreign-born blacks in King County). We will develop a multimedia tool in English, Kiswahili, and Amharic illustrating principles of HIV transmission in sexual networks for use in community discussions. We will identify sexual network message dissemination channels in the target populations including social network approaches (person-to-person communication), civil society approaches (faith-based organizations, community events and organizations), and the media. Subaim 2.1.1. We will continue to inform ourselves about best practices in community-participatory research via seminars and discussions. Aim 2: Pilot and evaluate the impact of the HIV prevention concurrency messages among populations of African-Americans and African-born populations in King County. The CAB Disparities Working Group will launch HIV prevention concurrency messaging and evaluate acceptability and impact, including message comprehension and recall (1-month post recall among n=30 African-Americans and n=30 Kenyans and Ethiopians), intention, and attitude strength. The CAB Working Group will develop and implement a manual of community-based research translation processes used including community outreach, HIV prevention message development, and message dissemination in affected communities. Subaim  2.2.1. We will build capacity by educating ourselves about cutting edge approaches to development and marketing of health messages. Aim 3: HIV disparity message findings and tools will be shared in a national seminar. We will invite the national Center for AIDS Research network and their CABs to a national meeting, where we will also explore the feasibility of a community-collaborative multi-site randomized controlled trial assessing impact of a sexual concurrency intervention for HIV prevention in areas with large populations of African- Americans and African immigrants. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study addresses the critical and persistent disparity in HIV among persons of African heritage. A novel sexual network approach that translates new scientific understanding into culturally-resonant prevention messages delivered within a community-participatory framework has the potential to be implemented for other similar populations across the US.          ",Reducing HIV Disparities: Sexual Concurrency Communication for HIV Prevention amo,7673468,R21HD057832,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Radio ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Social Network ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Translation Process ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Text ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' informant ', ' Comprehension ', ' Intention ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health ', ' working group ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Information Networks ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' insight ', ' African ', ' Manuals ', ' Marketing ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Persons ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Play ', ' Printing ', ' tool ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Stigmata ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' animation ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Attitude ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Washington ', ' Woman ', ' Event ', ' meetings ', ' Church ', ' American ', ' condoms ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' County ', ' Native-Born ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Actions ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Population ', ' Abstinence ', ' community organizations ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' civil society ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2009,238916,0.013963834637251878
"Encouraging Safe Dates: Reducing Intimate Partner Violence in South African Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  HIV prevalence rates in South Africa are among the highest in the world; transmission is largely heterosexual, and young people, especially young females, are disproportionately affected. It is increasingly understood that efforts to promote safer sexual practices in this vulnerable population may be undermined by high rates of intimate partner violence (IPV). Epidemiologic and ethnographic research among South African youth, much of it conducted by members of this research team, has provided data to support a model suggesting that ideologies of male superiority and cultural violence are manifested in gender inequality. In this setting, boys are encouraged to enforce the hierarchy, and to use violence to punish transgressions and stifle resultant conflicts. Girls receive little social support to protect them from such aggressive control. Alcohol and drug use are associated with higher levels of relationship conflict and a greater likelihood that violence will occur. High rates of rape and coerced sex are associated with early initiation of sex, failure to use condoms, and multiple, risky sexual partnerships, increasing risk of HIV transmission. Accordingly, it is proposed that an intervention be developed to reduce IPV among South African youth by: increasing social support for girls; questioning male norms of superiority, sexual entitlement, and control of girls; reducing alcohol and drug use; and improving communication to reduce the use of violence in resolving relationship conflicts. Efficacious interventions to delay sexual initiation, promote correct and consistent condom use, and discourage multiple risky sexual partnerships will also be integrated into the program. The intervention will be adapted from a school-based program, Safe Dates, which significantly reduced IPV among 8th and 9th grade students in the southeastern United States (Foshee, Bauman, Ennet, et al., 2004). It also will incorporate materials from two South African intervention programs, Our Times Our Choices (Drs. Zimmerman and Cupp) and Stepping Stones (Jewkes, Nduna & Jama 2002; Jewkes et al., 2007) which have shown significant effects on key outcomes. Specifically, we propose to: 1) Adapt Safe Dates for use as an intervention to reduce IPV among in- school South African adolescents and integrate interventions targeting HIV risk behavior; 2) Conduct a pilot study of the adapted Safe Dates program with in-school South African adolescents to: a) reduce IPV, the primary target of the intervention, and b) delay initiation of sex, increase condom use, decrease the number of sexual partners, and decrease risky sexual partnerships, the secondary targets of the intervention. The pilot study will employ an experimental design, a six-month follow-up period, and audio-enhanced personal digital assistants (APDAs) to optimize honest self-report. The primary goals of the proposed project are to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the adapted Safe Dates program in South Africa and to provide estimates of effect sizes, so that a randomized control trial can be designed to assess its efficacy.                ",Encouraging Safe Dates: Reducing Intimate Partner Violence in South African Youth,7581012,R34MH081792,"['Inequality ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' male ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Motivation ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Staging ', ' Forcible intercourse ', ' Rape ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' South Africa ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' Southeast US ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' Standardization ', ' Arts ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Adopted ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' Calculi ', ' Stone ', ' Biliary or Urinary Stones ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Heavy Drinking ', ' heavy alcohol use ', ' extreme drinking ', ' excessive ethanol ingestion ', ' excessive drinking ', ' excessive alcohol intake ', ' excessive alcohol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol consumption ', ' excess ethanol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol consumption ', ' drink heavily ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' child sexual assault ', ' youth rape ', ' pediatric rape ', ' juvenile rape ', ' child rape ', ' adolescent rape ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' early sex initiation ', ' initiation of intercourse ', ' early sexual initiation ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' alcohol prevention ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' older women ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' efficacy testing ', ' reduced alcohol use ', ' consistent condom use ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Personal Digital Assistant ', ' Pocket Personal Computer ', ' Pocket PCs ', ' Personal Digital Assistant Computer ', ' Palmtop computer ', ' Palmtop ', ' Palm-top computer ', ' Palm-top ', ' Palm Pilot ', ' PDA Computer ', ' Blueberry Device ', ' BlackBerry Device ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Stifle joint ', ' Data ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Language ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' African ', ' ']",NIMH,PACIFIC INSTITUTE FOR RES AND EVALUATION,R34,2009,178891,-0.003309642672136005
"HIV Risk Behavior of Adult Minority Heterosexual Men in New York City The proposed study will focus on an essential but neglected area of HIV prevention research: sexual behavior and determinants of HIV risk among HIV seropositive adult African American and Latino men who have sex with women (MSW) in urban settings. Heterosexual transmission of HIV has steadily increased in recent years and now accounts for over one-third of all new HIV/AIDS diagnoses in the U.S.—and 80% among women. Minority women are especially vulnerable to sexually acquired HIV. Social and cultural norms that reinforce gender inequalities often prevent minority women from enacting safe sex practices with male partners. This has led researchers to focus on women's sexual risk behavior and the development of HIV prevention programs targeted to women, often to the exclusion of men. However, male condom use remains under the control of men, and culturally sanctioned social norms afford men greater power with respect to sexual behavior and decision-making. Despite the central role played by HIV positive adult minority men in the heterosexual transmission of HIV, little is known about their sexual practices, and the psychosocial, contextual, and cultural factors underlying men’s risk behavior. The proposed 2-year study will help fill this gap using a mixed methods design involving 324 HIV positive adult MSW recruited from primary care settings in Harlem and South Bronx in New York City. This research will be guided by an integrated conceptual framework of MSW sexual risk behavior, synthesized from current health behavior theory and refined through qualitative interviews. A structured quantitative questionnaire will be administered to participants using audio computer assisted self-interview (ACASI) techniques. The questionnaire will include items documenting the range, variation, patterns, and networks of adult men’s heterosexual behavior, and related determinants. Structural equation modeling will be used to specify and validate an empirical model of HIV positive men’s sexual risk that will inform HIV prevention efforts targeting secondary heterosexual transmission of HIV to women in high prevalence communities. Heterosexual transmission of HIV has steadily increased in recent years and now accounts for over one-third of all new HIV/AIDS diagnoses in the U.S. HIV positive heterosexual and bisexual men play a major role in the sexual transmission of HIV. Presently, there are serious gaps in our knowledge of African American and Latino men’s sexual behaviors that facilitate the transmission of HIV to women. Attainment of such knowledge can suggest ways to increase men’s active participation in preventing the spread of HIV infection.",HIV Risk Behavior of Adult Minority Heterosexual Men in New York City,7621187,R01HD057793,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' Budgets ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Male Condoms ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Fees ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Gender Role ', ' Health behavior ', ' Homologous Serum Hepatitis Virus ', ' HBV ', ' Hepatitis B Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' living will ', ' Living Wills ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' New York City ', ' Play ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Economic Recession ', ' Gender ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' TimeLine ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Area ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Ensure ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' HCV ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Clinic ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' psychosocial ', ' Equation ', ' AIDS/HIV diagnosis ', ' safer sexual behavior ', ' safer sex ', ' Responsible sexual behavior ', ' Responsible Sex ', ' Protected Sex ', ' Safe Sex ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention program ', ' Exclusion ', ' social inequality ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' human subject protection ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Low income ', ' Age-Years ', ' High Prevalence ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' trend ', ' To specify ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' neglect ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' protective behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' high risk ', ' primary care setting ', ' public health priorities ', ' surveillance data ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2009,499723,0.0792589511576265
"Sex Differences: Pathophysiology of Symptomatic Non-Obstructive Coronary Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K23 Career Development Award application has been designed to launch the academic research career of the candidate, Dr. Jennifer Tremmel. Dr. Tremmel is a Cardiologist at Stanford, trained in both preventive and interventional cardiology, whose career goals are to become an independent clinical investigator and thought leader in the fields of women's cardiovascular health and sex differences in cardiovascular disease. Her career development plan centers on the research question of whether or not there is a sex difference in the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease. Specifically, she asks if women presenting with symptoms suggestive of angina, but demonstrating no angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease, are more likely than similarly presenting men to have coronary endothelial dysfunction, coronary microvascular disease, and diffuse deposition of coronary atherosclerotic plaque. Her specific aims are: 1. To compare the incidence and severity of coronary endothelial dysfunction between women and men using intracoronary acetylcholine (Ach) and quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). 2.

"Cultural Scripts Influencing HIV Prevention Among African American Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The African American female population is profoundly and disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted epidemics. Despite comprising less than 14% of the female population in 2005 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2008) Black women represented approximately 64% of all U.S. women living with HIV/AIDS, the majority of whom contracted the HIV virus through heterosexual contact (CDC, 2008). In Washington, DC in particular, the disparity is even more striking: between 2001 and 2006, Black women accounted for 92% of all reported HIV cases among women (Government of the District of Colombia Department of Health, 2007). In light of these alarming statistics, an enhanced understanding of the impact of sociocultural factors specific to women of this ethnic group on their participation in unsafe sexual behavior is of utmost importance. Recent literature has emphasized the role of culturally transmitted guidelines and expectations about sexual behavior in perpetuating the epidemic among this population, suggesting that such specifications encourage unsafe sexual practices (Stephens & Phillips, 2003). However, the relationship of such expecations to African American women's perceived capacity to assert themselves in enacting sexual safety (e.g., by enforcing condom use or refusing unwanted sex) is lacking empirical attention. The purpose of the proposed study is to address this gap in the literature by developing a measure of sexual expectations and examining the relationship of such expectations to sexual self-concept and sexual self-efficacy within a sample of HIV-positive and high-risk, HIV-negative African American women living in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Researchers at The George Washington University will collaborate with the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) to access the targeted population. A sample of approximately 191 African American women between the ages of 21 and 69, approximately three quarters of whom are HIV-positive, will be recruited from the existing WIHS sample. Participant interviews (n=8) and a focus group comprised of 8 women will inform instrument development, and quantitative measures will be administered to 175 women in paper-and-pencil, self-report format during regularly scheduled WIHS clinic visits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study is of public health importance in that it will clarify barriers to sexual safety among African American women, a vulnerable and underserved population at high risk for contracting and transmitting the HIV virus. Findings will be useful in informing the development of culturally appropriate intervention programs targeting this group, ultimately aiding the effort to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic within and beyond the African American community.           ",Cultural Scripts Influencing HIV Prevention Among African American Women,7758408,F31MH085584,"['Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Trajectories and Consequences of Nonmarital Fathering    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this project is to investigate the factors associated with men becoming unwed fathers and the nature and consequences of unmarried fathers' involvement with children. This is an important topic, given the large and growing number of men who will have at least one child outside of marriage and the large fraction of children and mothers who will be exposed to their fathering behavior. Yet, our knowledge about nonmarital fathering and how it affects partners, children, and the fathers themselves remains limited, in part because men are often under-represented in national surveys. Fathers represent an important resource for children, ideally investing the time, money and emotion that promote healthy child development and socialization, but unwed fathers often have individual and contextual characteristics that deter and complicate their potential for positive involvement in family life; these include low human capital, high rates of social-behavioral problems, and a high likelihood of living away from their child, as well as three important but little explored factors related to nonmarital fathering fathers' ongoing relationships with mothers (whether romantic and/or co-parenting), the fact that unmarried men (and women) often have children by multiple partners (so-called `multi-partnered fertility'), and the fact that a non-trivial number of unwed fathers have been or will be incarcerated. Using three national datasets (the National Survey of Family Growth, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, and the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study), this research will provide new information about the trajectories and consequences of recent and contemporary nonmarital fathering. The study includes three specific aims: 1) To evaluate the antecedents of nonmarital fatherhood and the effects of becoming an unwed father on the male life course; 2) To analyze the nature and dynamics of unwed fathers' involvement in families as partners and parents, especially as linked to relationships with mothers, multi-partnered fertility, and paternal incarceration; and 3) To examine the consequences of unmarried fathers' involvement for the wellbeing of children and of fathers themselves, including whether the benefits are moderated by fathers' characteristics or context. Using a life course perspective and drawing on family systems theory, this project will evaluate key stages and turning points in men becoming and then being unmarried fathers, including factors that both enhance and deter positive parenting over time. The study will explore race/ethnic differences in unwed fathering and consider key analytic challenges related to social selection and missing data. Overall, this study will provide new information about the process, content, and consequences of nonmarital fathering for children and families and may shed light on the development of sound policies and programs to strengthen families. PUBLIC HELATH RELEVANCE This study will provide new information about the factors associated with men becoming unwed fathers and the nature and consequences of unmarried fathers' involvement with children. Given the rising fraction of births that occur outside of marriage and the negative consequences of father absence for children, this study will provide information to aid the development of sound policies and programs to keep fathers connected to children and to strengthen families across diverse contexts.             ",Trajectories and Consequences of Nonmarital Fathering,7693694,R01HD057894,"['Demography ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Provider ', ' Economics ', ' Emotions ', ' Employment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Fertility ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' partner violence ', ' violent partner ', ' problem, partner, abuse, violent ', ' Affect ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Investments ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' male ', ' Marriage ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Mothers ', ' Multiple Partners ', ' Parents ', ' Staging ', ' fatherhood ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Socialization ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' sound ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Systems Theory ', ' Time ', ' Unmarried Father ', ' Woman ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' father role ', ' paternity ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Generations ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Unmarried ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' nonmarital childbearing ', ' premarital childbearing ', ' human capital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' child bearing ', ' childbearing ', ' bearing children ', ' bear children ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' depression ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2009,157781,0.0426578223555679
"The impact of incarceration on partner selection norms and HIV    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Half of new HIV infections in the United States are among African-Americans. After decades of research focused on individual factors, investigators have concluded that individual behaviors are insufficient to explain the racial disparity in HIV rates. As a result, researchers have turned to focus on social factors that influence HIV risk behaviors. Incarceration is one such factor that disproportionately affects the health of African American individuals, families, and communities, and is associated with HIV infection. Multiple theories have been proposed about the association between incarceration rates and HIV rates. To test one proposed explanation for the association, the applicant will conduct a community-based survey in African American communities in Baltimore, Maryland. More than half of young African-American men in Baltimore are incarcerated or otherwise involved in the criminal justice system, and the metropolitan area has the fifth highest HIV rate in the nation. The incarceration of African-American males makes male partners scarce, and concurrent sexual partnerships with multiple females may become normal for many men. The perception that few male partners are available may promote the belief that men have more power than women in sexual relationships, resulting in less condom use and HIV infection. The study specifically aims to: 1) develop and validate scales to measure social norms about engaging in concurrent sexual partnerships; 2) assess whether psychosocial factors (norms about concurrent partnerships, perception of partner availability, and relationship power) are associated with behavioral risk factors for HIV, such as condom use and concurrent sexual partnerships; and 3 )assess whether these psychosocial factors explain the relationship between incarceration and HIV infection. Male and female adults will be recruited from high- poverty, high-AIDS prevalence areas in Baltimore as part of the CDC National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System study of heterosexuals at high risk of HIV infection. Participants will be tested for HIV, and a standardized questionnaire will collect information from 750 participants about sexual activity, drug use, incarceration status, and other behavioral and partner characteristics. The scale measuring social norms about engaging in concurrent sexual partnerships will be developed in a pilot study in the Baltimore City STD Clinics. National research priorities support research dedicated to understanding the social context of sexual risk behaviors. Identifying how social factors can impact HIV rates will allow for prevention programs that can alter the social environment and ultimately individual HIV risk.           ",The impact of incarceration on partner selection norms and HIV,7690765,F31MH080625,"['Female ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Link ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' sexual relationship ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Inequality ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' male ', ' Maryland ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' tool ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' behavior change ', ' metropolitan ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' social ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' theories ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' Prevalence ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,9162,0.0763610182932917
"Investigating the sexual milieu of young African American college students: Impli    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Due to their enhanced risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV/AIDS, the need to target young African American men and women in college is substantial and there is a significant contribution to be made in designing risk reduction interventions that are specifically targeted to this group. Sixty-one percent of people under 25 diagnosed with HIV/AIDS during 2001-2004 were African American (CDC, 2007). The disproportionate number of cases among this group, combined with the high levels of sexual experimentation and prevalence of STIs among young people, suggests that African American college students are at higher risk and should be a programmatic AND research priority. For many students, the college environment provides a sense of new independence, self-determination, and peer pressure to engage in risky sexual behaviors. Therefore, this study will investigate a culturally grounded, multi-dimensional model of student sexual decision-making and behavior among African American students attending a historically Black institution in North Carolina. This model hypothesizes that sexual decision-making and behavior are shaped by psychosocial factors such as gender role identity, sociosexual orientation, and perceived mate availability. These factors are mediated by perceived vulnerability and social norms, and moderated by varying levels of perceived self- efficacy, spirituality/religiosity, and sensation-seeking. The study uses a three-phase, successive mixed-method approach. The qualitative data obtained from 96 students in Phase I (focus groups) will be used to operationalize the constructs used to inform the quantitative survey (320 students) in Phase II. Phase III (townhalls) is designed to function as an efficient way to disseminate the information to the student body with a goal of building a campuswide prevention initiative. A better understanding of factors associated with African American college students' risky and responsible sexual behavior is needed to help guide the development of strategies and interventions to reduce the rate of HIV infection in this population, and advance the translation of culturally grounded research into effective practice.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The disproportionate number of HIV/AIDS cases among African Americans, combined with the high levels of sexual experimentation and prevalence of STIs among young people, suggests that the sexual milieu of African American college students is an area where more culturally and ecologically appropriate research is necessary. For many students, the college environment provides a sense of new independence and self-determination, plus also peer pressure to engage in risky sexual behaviors. Given the extended latency period for developing observable HIV-related symptoms, it is likely that many adults with AIDS were infected when they were college students (Bazargan, Kelly, Stein, Husaini, & Bazargan, 2000), which is why studying this population is so important. Therefore, this study will investigate a culturally grounded, multi-dimensional model of student sexual decision-making and behavior among African American students attending a historically Black institution in North Carolina. This model hypothesizes that sexual decision-making and behavior are shaped by psychosocial factors such as gender role identity, sociosexual orientation, and perceived mate availability. These factors are mediated by perceived vulnerability and social norms, and moderated by varying levels of perceived self-efficacy, spirituality/religiosity, and sensation-seeking. The study uses a three-phase, successive mixed-method approach. A total of 416 students will be recruited during phases I and II.

"Exploring Patterns of Concurrency Among Urban African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed K-01 career development award explores patterns of concurrent sexual partnerships, or partnerships that overlap in time, among urban African Americans in Philadelphia.  I am an Assistant Professor of Medicine (Research) in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Brown University Medical School. I hope to use the K-01 award to transition from health policy to behavioral and social science research in HIV/AIDS prevention. My long-term career goals are to pursue an academic career in order to conduct behavioral and sociological research in the field of HIV/AIDS, to publish articles in the peer- reviewed literature, and conduct HIV/AIDS research that influences public policy.  I hope to use the K01 award to learn how to conduct community-based participatory research (CPBR), develop new quantitative skills for behavioral science research, acquire expertise in behavioral research for HIV prevention and HIV intervention research, and gain expertise in health disparities research and ethical conduct of research in underserved populations.  The research components of my application follow: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches will be employed to explore 32-40 African American community leaders' opinions and knowledge about sexual concurrency and other factors contributing to HIV health disparities among urban African Americans. CBPR will also be used to examine African American community leaders' interest in developing and piloting novel interventions to address concurrent sexual relationships and other factors contributing to HIV health disparities among African Americans.  Subsequently, differential rates of sexual concurrency and other factors that may contribute to racial disparities in HIV rates among African Americans testing for HIV in Philadelphia will be explored. This analysis will rely on secondary survey data collected during Philadelphia's rapid testing campaign, which tests approximately 6,000 people annually.  The beliefs, attitudes, practices, patterns and causes of concurrent sexual partnerships will then be explored through 80 in-depth qualitative interviews among HIV- negative African American men and women testing for HIV in Philadelphia.  In keeping with the CBPR framework guiding this study, the findings of each of the aforementioned research projects will be shared and explored with African American community leaders and the Philadelphia community at large. Community input about the study findings, appropriate interpretations, interventions, and public policy suggestions will be solicited.  The findings from the aforementioned studies will then be used to design an R01 grant application proposing an HIV prevention intervention. The intervention will combine behavioral and social interventions to address concurrent sexual partnerships, and may aim to increase condom use rates with main and non-main partners, reduce concurrent sexual partners, or address other factors contributing to HIV health disparities among HIV-negative African Americans.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed K-01 career development award explores patterns of concurrent sexual partnerships, or partnerships that overlap in time, among urban African Americans in Philadelphia.

CBPR will also be used to examine African American community leaders' interest in developing and piloting novel interventions to address concurrent sexual relationships and other factors contributing to HIV health disparities among African Americans.  Subsequently, differential rates of sexual concurrency and other factors that may contribute to racial disparities in HIV rates among African Americans testing for HIV in Philadelphia will be explored. This analysis will rely on secondary survey data collected during Philadelphia's rapid testing campaign, which tests approximately 6,000 people annually.  The beliefs, attitudes, practices, patterns and causes of concurrent sexual partnerships will then be explored through 80 in-depth qualitative interviews among HIV- negative African American men and women testing for HIV in Philadelphia.  In keeping with the CBPR framework guiding this study, the findings of each of the aforementioned research projects will be shared and explored with African American community leaders and the Philadelphia community at large. Community input about the study findings, appropriate interpretations, interventions, and public policy suggestions will be solicited.  The findings from the aforementioned studies will then be used to design an R01 grant application proposing an HIV prevention intervention. The intervention will combine behavioral and social interventions to address concurrent sexual partnerships, and may aim to increase condom use rates with main and non-main partners, reduce concurrent sexual partners, or address other factors contributing to HIV health disparities among HIV-negative African Americans.           Project Narrative  This proposed K-01 career development award explores patterns of concurrent sexual partnerships, or partnerships that overlap in time, among urban African Americans in Philadelphia.

"Social Contexts, Sexual Networks, and Racial-Ethnic Disparities in STDs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research component of this project explores how racial-ethnic segregation and inequality shape sexual networks and the spread of sexually transmitted disease (STD). Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health), I will explore how racial- ethnic segregation and inequality at the school- and neighborhood-levels influence the formation of sexual partnerships. Applying parameter estimates from the Add Health to simulated sexual networks, I will then assess how sexual networks and disease diffusion may progress differently in settings with varying population compositions and patterns of racial-ethnic inequality. Informed by structural sociological theory, this research takes an interdisciplinary approach and applies testable social science hypotheses to problems of infectious disease epidemiology. Through relationships with mentors and advisors, coursework, and participation in professional seminars, the training component of this project would allow me to expand my work on health disparities to include (i) greater attention to social contexts and networks as determinants of health, and (ii) new types of contagious health outcomes. There are three career development objectives for the proposed project: (i) obtain skills and expertise in infectious disease epidemiology and network analysis; (ii) conduct original research on racial-ethnic STD disparities in the U.S.; and (iii) prepare a major grant to support an independent research program in social networks, health disparities, and infectious disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are large racial-ethnic disparities in sexually transmitted diseases in the United States.

"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Fall Risk and Bone Strength Among Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The changing shape of the U.S. population age structure will dramatically increase the number of osteoporotic fractures in the elderly; the increase will disproportionately affect minorities and men. It is therefore important to understand the epidemiology of osteoporosis in these populations. While there are clear racial/ethnic differences in fracture rates, their origins are not understood. The proposed study will be a comprehensive effort to further our understanding of the fundamental causes of racial/ethnic disparities in fracture rates by focusing on markers of two primary `upstream' determinants of fracture: falls and bone fragility. The Boston Area Community Health/Bone (BACH/Bone) Survey is a study of skeletal health in a randomly selected group of 1,219 black, Hispanic, and white men between 29-80 y. BACH/Bone staff have been very productive, producing over 10 papers for peer-reviewed journals. We propose a second wave of data collection on ~825 men to begin ~6.5 y after baseline, when the cohort will be between 35-86 y. The Specific Aims of the proposed study are to, in a racially/ethnically diverse, population-based sample of men: 1) Estimate longitudinal changes in markers of bone strength and fall risk, with and without adjustment for known risk factors; 2) Determine the relative contributions of social factors, individual risk behaviors and health status, and physiological influences to racial/ethnic differences in markers of fall risk and bone strength; 3) Establish the first age- and racial/ethnic group-specific, population-based estimates of bone microarchitecture, and identify determinants of observed age and racial/ethnic differences; 4) Determine whether there are age and racial/ethnic differences in the ratio of bone loads to bone strength (the `factor of risk'); 5) Examine whether genetic ancestry contributes to variations in markers of fall risk and bone strength beyond that attributable to self-identified race/ethnicity. The representativeness and racial/ethnic diversity of the BACH/Bone cohort are unique, and, as such, the potential impact of the study is enormous. By focusing upstream on markers of fall risk and bone strength with state-of-the-art measures, it will make landmark contributions to our understanding of the elusive mechanisms underlying racial/ethnic differences in bone fragility. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Boston Area Community Health/Bone Survey is an observational research study examining the complex relationships between aging, social structure, health and lifestyle, hormones, genetic factors, and markers of fall risk as well as bone strength in a population-based sample of racially/ethnically diverse aging men.

"Gender, Power and Latino Mens HIV Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): AIDS has been a leading cause of death among Latino women and men 25 to 44 years of age for more than a decade. The few HIV prevention and treatment interventions developed specifically for Latino men have focused on injecting drug users (IDU) or men who have sex with men (MSM), but have neglected a critical epidemiological group, men who have sex with men and with women (MSMW). This group is particularly relevant in understanding the spread of HIV given the role they play in sexual network connections between the homosexually active male population and heterosexual population. The proposed study will develop an innovative pilot intervention for behaviorally bisexual Latino men. We propose the following specific aims: 1) To describe the mechanisms by which contextual factors of labor and cultural backgrounds (such as access to employment, ethnic-racial tensions, coping with job-related situations, heterosexism and gender norms in the workplace) influence bisexual men's likelihood of engaging in risky sexual practices; 2)To explore how men's notions of power are shaped by the centrality of family and religious background, and how these factors in turn, facilitate or prevent sexual risk taking among bisexual Latino men; 3) To describe bisexual Latino men's ideologies of HIV risk, the geographical context of HIV risk, and how bisexual risk behavior, and how they are related or not to gender and power dynamics in the men's lives; and, 4) To examine how the perceptions of members of AIDS Service Delivery Organizations (ASDOs) of societal notions of Latino masculinity and bisexuality create or limit access to HIV prevention services for bisexual Latino men in the New York Metropolitan Area. To accomplish these aims, we propose a 4-year ethnographic study design with two components of data collection. The first component will consists of in-depth interviews with behaviorally bisexual Latino men (n=160) from five research sites in the New York City metropolitan area. The first two years of the study will be dedicated to the in-depth interviews component. The second data collection component of the study will be an ethnography. This component will last 3 years, beginning in years 1 and 2 with key informant interviews (n=25) and continuing in year 3 with ethnographic mapping and 25 group interviews with AIDS Service Delivery Organizations across the 5 research sites. The last year of the project will focus on using Intervention Mapping (IM) to analyze the data collected and design the pilot intervention to reduce HIV risk among bisexual Latino men. The proposed study will be one of the first large-scale research projects to focus on issues of bisexuality and HIV risk among Latinos in the United States.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: 1. Given the raise in HIV cases in the United States, particularly among homosexually and bisexually active men of color, this study takes an innovative approach to the examination of HIV risk among by exploring how broad forms of social inequality and the sexual ecology of bisexual behavior among Latino men constrain the options for a relatively less powerful group of men, and how ideologies of masculinity intersect with structural social inequalities to create HIV risks for bisexual Latino men. 2. This will be one of the first large-scale research projects to focus on issues of bisexuality and HIV risk among Latinos and the first one to examine how the context of labor and sexual markets shape the sexual lives and health risks of bisexual men of color. 3.

"Cancer Disparities in California    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific subgroups of the population bear a greater cancer burden than the general population. It has been hypothesized, and from our own prior studies we have preliminary evidence, that sexual minorities are among the population groups to experience cancer disparities. The lack of reliable population-based cancer data systems that include sexual orientation impedes the confirmation of the existence of cancer disparities due to sexual orientation. The main goal of this secondary data analysis is to link two California-specific data sources, cancer registry data and a statewide population-based survey that measured sexual orientation, to assess cancer disparities due to sexual orientation. Using county-level data on sexual orientation, we will test the hypothesis that geographic areas in which more sexual minorities (defined as self-identified gay, lesbian, bisexuals) are concentrated have higher breast, lung and colorectal cancer incidence, more advanced stage at diagnosis, and greater cancer mortality compared to areas with fewer sexual minorities. We have four specific aims to identify breast, lung and colorectal cancer disparities in California: 1. Examine the relationship of breast, lung, and colorectal cancer incidence to the area-specific percentage of sexual minority populations (defined as women or men who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual) in California counties. 2. Determine the rate of late stage breast and colorectal cancer diagnoses to the area-specific percentage of sexual minority populations (defined as women or men who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual) in California counties. 3. Compare breast, lung, and colorectal cancer mortality as a function of the area-specific percentage of sexual minority populations (defined as women or men who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual) in California counties. 4. Compare California counties on breast, lung, and colorectal cancer incidence, late stage diagnosis, and mortality as a function of Census-derived area-specific percentage of same-sex partnered households to area-specific estimates derived from self-reported sexual orientation information. To date, ""true"" population-based estimates of cancers in sexual minorities are not known, yet urgently needed. Our methodological approach can provide information about disparities due to sexual orientation in California, and provide for information to be later utilized to focus interventions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Results from this study will show whether sexual minorities bear a disproportionate burden in California with respect to breast, lung, and colorectal cancers. If this innovative data use is successful, it can be replicated in other states, which also collect data on sexual orientation of their population and can ultimately be proposed as a useful tool for state health officials. In the absence of cancer surveillance data on sexual minorities, this tool can inform about within state disparities due to sexual orientation, and provide for information that can help focus interventions. Ultimately, this epidemiological approach to cancer disparities is a necessary first step on which we expect to build with follow-up research focused on understanding and eliminating disparities linked to sexual orientation.           Project Narrative Results from this study will show whether sexual minorities bear a disproportionate burden in California with respect to breast, lung, and colorectal cancers.

"Reducing sexual risk among African American heterosexual men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Abstract The purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test a novel group-level intervention to reduce sexual risk behavior and increase HIV testing among heterosexually active African American men. Heterosexually active men have been called the ""forgotten group"" in HIV prevention, with the bulk of interventions focusing on women or other groups at high risk of HIV. In the United States, heterosexual contact is currently the second highest mode of HIV acquisition and African Americans are over-represented among these cases. New York City is the metropolitan area with the largest number of AIDS cases among African American men attributed to heterosexual contact. We propose a mixed-method study among adult heterosexually active African American men living in high prevalence neighborhoods with the aims to: 1) explore through in-depth qualitative interviews and focus groups personal, behavioral, and socio-structural factors that affect HIV sexual risk behavior and HIV testing rates, and participant perspectives on intervention characteristics; 2) develop and pilot test the intervention; and 3) estimate the efficacy of the intervention on reducing sexual risk behaviors and increasing HIV testing. To achieve these aims, we propose to conduct 6 focus groups and 50 in-depth interviews to elicit: (a) descriptions and reflections on personal, behavioral and socio-structural factors that impact on HIV sexual risk behavior and HIV testing. These factors will be examined from a general perspective and through questions that elicit descriptions, reflections, and comparisons of past sexual risk events, both high and low risk, and the factors affecting the course of those events; (b) participant perspectives on intervention characteristics that may effectively lead to reductions in high risk behavior and increases in HIV testing. We will then develop and pilot test a multi-session group-level intervention informed by the findings of our formative research, and pilot test the interview instrument. In the last phase, we will conduct a pre-post test study by enrolling 50 heterosexually active African American men at risk of HIV infection into the intervention. At baseline and 3 months, standardized data collection using audio computer assisted self-interviewing technology will assess outcomes and covariates. The primary outcomes for the estimating efficacy will be the occurrence of unprotected vaginal intercourse and/or unprotected anal intercourse with female partners and concurrent partnering with female and/or male partners. Secondary outcomes will include occurrence of HIV testing and number of new and total female and male sex partners. The results of this proposed project will be used to estimate sample size or effect size for scaling up to a randomized controlled trial. The heterosexual HIV epidemic is a growing public health problem in the United States. African Americans are over-represented among these cases, contributing to the growing health disparities that characterize the HIV epidemic in the US. This study will develop and test a behavioral intervention to reduce sexual risk and increase HIV testing among heterosexually active African American men.

African Americans are over-represented among these cases, contributing to the growing health disparities that characterize the HIV epidemic in the US. This study will develop and test a behavioral intervention to reduce sexual risk and increase HIV testing among heterosexually active African American men.",Reducing sexual risk among African American heterosexual men,8103719,UR6PS000667,[''],NCHHSTP,NEW YORK BLOOD CENTER,UR6,2010,200000,0.08165473168499562
"Social capital and HIV risk behavior among rural migrants in China    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Worldwide data suggest that migrants are at increased risk of HIV infection. The high rates of HIV infection and the mobility of migrant populations make migrants a living bridge to spread the AIDS virus between the countries/places of origin and the countries/places of destination. Research findings indicate that the increased HIV infection among migrants is associated their high prevalence of HIV risk behaviors (substance use and risky sex), which in turn, are determined by socioenvironmental and situational factors. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which environmental factors lead to HIV risk behavior. Guided by the Social Capital Theory, in this project, we propose to test two hypothesized mechanisms that may link social influences to HIV risk behavior among migrants - the lack of social support (including informational, instrumental and emotional) and the weakening of informal social control (including collective efficacy and normative beliefs). Rural migrants lost their social capital (defined as durable, resource-rich, trustworthy, and reciprocal network connections a person accumulated) deeply rooted in the place of rural origin and they may experience difficulties rebuilding social capital in the urban destination due to their low socioeconomic status. Migrants with limited social capital may then experience difficulties obtaining informational, instrumental, and emotional support to establish their career and life in the stressful urban settings; consequently use of substance becomes an attractive and convenient option. The lack of social capital may also make migrants less responsive to the social capital-based collective efficacy (volunteer actions by community members against deviate behaviors that may devalue the community), increasing the likelihood to engage in sexual risk behavior. When rebuilding social capital, migrants may adopt more liberal attitudes and more open values about sex, leading to sexual risk behavior. Exposure to more opportunities in urban settings will further exacerbate the likelihood. The low SES of female migrants may explain the higher HIV risk among them than among their male counterparts. The unprecedented rural-to-urban migration in China with the growing HIV/AIDS epidemic and the high prevalence of HIV risk behavior among rural migrants provide a window opportunity to investigate these issues. We will conduct the proposed research in Wuhan, China, a metropolitan city and provincial capital with a population of 8.1 million and one million rural migrants. The proposed research is highly significant and very innovative. Data for the proposed research will be collected using probability samples. The study samples will be selected using cost-effective methods supported by the GIS/GPS technology and a sample of 1200 rural migrants will be contrasted with the same number of non- migrant residents in the rural areas from where rural migrants originate and non-migrant residents in the urban areas where the rural migrants are currently living and working. In addition to survey data, sexually transmitted infections will also be assessed. We expected that findings from this research will advance our understanding of the migration-related HIV/AIDS transmission and provide needed data supporting our next step of research - devising and implementing innovative programs for HIV prevention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to examine social capital and its relationship with HIV risk behavior and sexually transmitted infection among rural migrants in China using a random sample. This research is fully relevant to public health because the expected findings from this study will provide data supporting innovative HIV/AIDS prevention among Chinese rural migrants as well as migrants in general - a significant and global strategy in the era of frequent domestic and international population migration in response to globalization and the developmental disparities in the 21st century.           NARRATIVE In this project, we propose to examine social capital and its relationship with HIV risk behavior and sexually transmitted infection among rural migrants in China using a random sample.

"Trajectories and Consequences of Nonmarital Fathering    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this project is to investigate the factors associated with men becoming unwed fathers and the nature and consequences of unmarried fathers' involvement with children. This is an important topic, given the large and growing number of men who will have at least one child outside of marriage and the large fraction of children and mothers who will be exposed to their fathering behavior. Yet, our knowledge about nonmarital fathering and how it affects partners, children, and the fathers themselves remains limited, in part because men are often under-represented in national surveys. Fathers represent an important resource for children, ideally investing the time, money and emotion that promote healthy child development and socialization, but unwed fathers often have individual and contextual characteristics that deter and complicate their potential for positive involvement in family life; these include low human capital, high rates of social-behavioral problems, and a high likelihood of living away from their child, as well as three important but little explored factors related to nonmarital fathering fathers' ongoing relationships with mothers (whether romantic and/or co-parenting), the fact that unmarried men (and women) often have children by multiple partners (so-called `multi-partnered fertility'), and the fact that a non-trivial number of unwed fathers have been or will be incarcerated. Using three national datasets (the National Survey of Family Growth, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, and the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study), this research will provide new information about the trajectories and consequences of recent and contemporary nonmarital fathering. The study includes three specific aims: 1) To evaluate the antecedents of nonmarital fatherhood and the effects of becoming an unwed father on the male life course; 2) To analyze the nature and dynamics of unwed fathers' involvement in families as partners and parents, especially as linked to relationships with mothers, multi-partnered fertility, and paternal incarceration; and 3) To examine the consequences of unmarried fathers' involvement for the wellbeing of children and of fathers themselves, including whether the benefits are moderated by fathers' characteristics or context. Using a life course perspective and drawing on family systems theory, this project will evaluate key stages and turning points in men becoming and then being unmarried fathers, including factors that both enhance and deter positive parenting over time. The study will explore race/ethnic differences in unwed fathering and consider key analytic challenges related to social selection and missing data. Overall, this study will provide new information about the process, content, and consequences of nonmarital fathering for children and families and may shed light on the development of sound policies and programs to strengthen families. PUBLIC HELATH RELEVANCE This study will provide new information about the factors associated with men becoming unwed fathers and the nature and consequences of unmarried fathers' involvement with children. Given the rising fraction of births that occur outside of marriage and the negative consequences of father absence for children, this study will provide information to aid the development of sound policies and programs to keep fathers connected to children and to strengthen families across diverse contexts.

"Disparities in sexually transmitted infections among young women: Role of individ    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although there are significant and longstanding racial disparities in sexually transmitted infections (STI) among young women, their causal mechanisms are unidentified. Unprotected sex, concurrency, and partner choice are well established risk factors, but they do not account for the differences between racial groups. One factor known to differ significantly by race and correlate strongly with STI risk is incarceration. High rates of incarceration and crime in a community have also been associated with higher STI prevalence in that community. Despite these associations and the dramatic differences in incarceration by race, few researchers have studied both individual- and community-level exposure to incarceration and crime and assessed whether these may partially explain STI disparities among young women. Among young women, incarceration and crime may influence STI risk both directly and indirectly. Interaction with the justice system may directly influence sexual risk behavior or substance use social norms. Following incarceration, an individual may have greater difficulty obtaining social services and gainful employment. Incarceration breaks up existing sexual partnerships and family units, removing and distancing the individual or partner and his/her economic and/or social support. Less direct effects of high incarceration rates in a community may lead to a paucity of eligible males, contributing to women having less power to negotiate condom use or being more tolerant of her partner's concurrency. Ex-offenders may change community social norms and transmit STIs as a result of their own riskier sexual behaviors and increased STI burden. In addition to these direct and indirect effects of incarceration, the confounding individual and community factors which may contribute to the likelihood of incarceration may also contribute to STI acquisition. In short, although the existing literature has repeatedly reported associations between incarceration and STIs, the direct, indirect, and confounding mechanisms have been difficult to tease apart and inadequately addressed to date. By building on relationships with justice system and public health leaders, our interdisciplinary team will link juvenile detention, incarceration, public health and clinical data sources at an individual-level to study incarceration, crime and STIs among young women 14 to 25 years old. The 10-year longitudinal data will help answer whether the association between incarceration and STI is causal or confounding and allow us to investigate further which specific factors of incarceration - timing, duration, indication, and recidivism history - contribute most to STI risk. We will employ geospatial methodologies to examine the effects of community-level incarceration in more depth, using point-level data and different extents of exposure. As different mechanisms may contribute to the spread of various STI differently, we will evaluate Chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV independently and in combination. Most importantly, we will evaluate how differences in individual- and community-level incarceration and crime may contribute to STI disparities among African American compared to white young women. Specifically, we aim to (1) assess whether the association between incarceration and sexually transmitted infections (STI) is stronger when incarceration precedes first STI; (2) assess whether community incarceration and crime rates are associated with an individual's risk of STI, after accounting for an individual's incarceration history; and (3) assess whether increased risk of STI among minority young women is diminished when accounting for an individual's differential incarceration rate and exposure to community incarceration and crime rates. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a result of the proposed research, we will better understand the relationship between incarceration, crime and sexually transmitted infection (STI) among young women and whether it contributes to significant racial disparities in STI. With this increased understanding, we will be better able to target resources to individuals and communities in need -during or preceding incarceration, in the community and/or through the justice system. From a public health and health services perspective, this information will aid in guiding policy and individually-targeted action in STI treatment and prevention.            As a result of the proposed research, we will better understand the relationship between incarceration, crime and sexually transmitted infection (STI) among young women and whether it contributes to significant racial disparities in STI.

"Reducing Risk of HIV/STD Infection Among African American Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The high rates of sexually transmitted disease (STD), including HIV, among African American (AA) men who reside in urban areas are a major public health problem. In addition, the most common route of HIV transmission among AA women is heterosexual exposure. Yet, little research has focused on gender-specific strategies to dissuade heterosexually active AA men from engaging in high HIV/STD transmission risk behaviors. Accordingly, the broad, long-term objective of this research is to develop such strategies. The Specific Aims include testing the efficacy of a theory-based, gender-specific contextually appropriate HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention in increasing consistent condom use, identifying theoretical mediators that account for the intervention's effects, and testing a strategy to increase the longevity of the intervention's effects. This research will utilize a randomized controlled trial design with 360 inner-city AA men 18 to 45 years who report recent unprotected vaginal or anal intercourse with a woman. Men will be randomly allocated to one of two small-group interventions specially designed for AA men: (a) a HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention or (b) a health promotion control intervention on healthful diet and physical activity. To evaluate a strategy to increase the longevity of intervention effects, the men also will be randomized to receive or not receive individually tailored mailings to reinforce the intervention's message. The approach draws on social cognitive theory, the theory of planned behavior, and the applicant's Preliminary Studies with AA men. The primary outcome is self-reported consistent condom use during vaginal and heterosexual anal intercourse in the previous 3 months collected at baseline and 6 and 12 months post-intervention via audio-computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI). Secondary outcomes include other sexual behaviors and theoretical variables hypothesized to mediate intervention efficacy. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) and random effects models will be employed to address the Specific Aims.               RELEVANCE: This research may provide an urgently needed intervention to reduce the risk of STDs, including HIV, in African American men, one of the highest risk populations in the US. Moreover, African American women have 20 times the rate of HIV seen in White women, with over 75% of the cases are tied to sexual relations with men. However, few trials have tested gender-specific HIV/STD risk-reduction interventions for heterosexually active men.",Reducing Risk of HIV/STD Infection Among African American Men,7809333,R01MD004075,"['Risk Reduction ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diet ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' trial design ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Behavioral ', ' Female ', ' Intention ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Physical activity ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' post intervention ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' disease transmission ', ' infectious disease transmission ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' Mails ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Native Americans ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Planning Theory ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Life ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Route ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' behavior change ', ' Equation ', ' inner city ', ' American ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' cost ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' high risk ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' consistent condom use ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2010,398541,0.00770674393320103
"Implicit Status Communication & Management: Physiological & Social Costs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite gender equity in many professions, men continue to dominate in leadership. Although just as effective as male leaders, women leaders (WLs) may experience unique challenges that undermine their health. Why? Prejudice against women in leadership persists. Women develop within social institutions ill-equipped to foster their leadership skills. The need for a more complete understanding of how women ""do"" leadership motivated the proposed research. The focus is on the implicit, non-conscious communication of status. Research has shown that during a communication task, men in lower status roles (followers) converge non-conscious aspects of their speech toward men in higher status roles (leaders), whose speech does not change. Because behavioral mimicry elicits liking, such an asymmetrical pattern is consistent with a defensive response to being in a subservient role. However, mimicry is also predicted by perspective taking ability. Unexpectedly, in the same communication task, WLs converge their speech toward followers (Pardo, 2006). Thus this task can potentially provide a window into gender differences in the implicit communication of status. It is unclear whether WLs' convergence is a social threat response (akin to men in the subservient role) or evidence of heightened social skills. To address this puzzle, the proposed research uses an established communication paradigm, during which pre-, post-, and during-interaction speech is recorded. Participants (Ps) complete a collaborative task in either the Leader or Follower role. Listeners judge the speech samples to establish how much each P's speech converges toward the partner. Three studies will address the following questions with students at a university (50 percent female) that emphasizes educating future leaders: (a) Are prior findings of gender differences in implicit speech convergence robust? (b) What does convergence imply for partner's assessment of one's likeability and competence and for partner's affiliative behavior? Does convergence by WLs increase their likeability but reduce estimates of their competence? (c) Is convergence exaggerated or muted among WLs when their identity as female leaders is situationally threatened or when they are dispositionally concerned about gender-based rejection? (d) Is convergence predicted by a physiological pattern of threat? Do gender and status moderate the pattern? (e) What are the physiological and psychological consequences of one's convergence? Does this depend on gender and status? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By examining gender differences in implicit communication of status, the research may help clarify why leadership may be more costly to women's health than to men's.           ",Implicit Status Communication & Management: Physiological & Social Costs,8082727,F31HD060418,"['Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Behavioral ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Affect ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' Health ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Intelligence ', ' Training ', ' Judgment ', ' Laws ', ' Leadership ', ' mimicry ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Individual ', ' London ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Americas ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Prejudice ', ' Attenuated ', ' Shapes ', ' Productivity ', ' Anxiety ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Social Interaction ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Arousal ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Dimensions ', ' Awareness ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior ', ' interest ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' Capital ', ' Social status ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Fortune ', ' Censuses ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' psychological distress ', ' Competence ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Communication ', ' cost ', ' affiliative behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' lexical ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NICHD,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,F31,2010,36546,0.03978818947177713
"Social and structural context of HIV/STI risk among FSWs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this application is to use social epidemiological methods to prospectively evaluate the impact of social, environmental, and structural factors on partner-level sexual and drug risk patterns and HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence among FSWs and to assess the feasibility of a subsequent HIV/STI intervention targeting FSWs in public place-based settings (e.g. bars, streets). Despite growing evidence of the effectiveness of environmental-structural HIV/STI interventions targeting FSWs, this research has been largely derived from developing country settings and establishment-based venues, and there is limited prospective data on the social and structural context of HIV/STI risk among FSWs in North America. Given recent reports suggest a temporal shift from an injection to a sexually-driven HIV epidemic among street-involved populations in many North American settings, there is a crucial need for more prospective data on the contextual factors promoting and constraining partner-level sexual and drug risk patterns and HIV/STI acquisition. Vancouver, Canada is ideally suited for the proposed study for several reasons. First, due to the quasi-criminalized nature of sex work and large informal tolerance zones, we are in a unique position to evaluate the context of HIV/STI risk among FSWs, not currently feasible in most US cities. Second, unlike many urban environments where the FSW community is fragmented, the current social and legal context of sex work in Canada, our ability to harness strong community FSW support for this application, and new supportive housing models currently operating legally as quasi-brothels demonstrate significant innovation and strong potential for a subsequent intervention stemming from the results of this research. Herein we propose to create an open prospective cohort of 500 active FSWs working in public place-based settings, including interview administered questionnaires and HIV/STI screening at baseline and 6monthly follow-up over a five year period. To our knowledge this study is among the first prospective studies of public place-based sex work in North America and as such, we will be uniquely positioned to evaluate the risk environment and temporal trends in partner-level risks and HIV/STI acquisition among FSWs. This research will address several questions central to the urgent challenges facing HIV/STI prevention capacity in North America and will directly assess the feasibility of a subsequent intervention that will be of critical importance to other developed country settings.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While there is growing concern in many North American cities of a temporal shift from an injection to a sexually-driven HIV epidemic, there has been limited prospective evaluation of the broader risk environment and HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence among FSWs. Using social epidemiological methods, this research will address this gap by evaluating the impact of the physical and social environment, gender inequities, and structural factors on partner-level sexual and drug risk patterns and HIV/STI acquisition among an open cohort of 500 FSWs.           PROJECT NARRATIVE While there is growing concern in many North American cities of a temporal shift from an injection to a sexually-driven HIV epidemic, there has been limited prospective evaluation of the broader risk environment and HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence among FSWs.

"Relationship Disruption during Incarceration and HIV Risk in African American Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men released from prison face disproportionate HIV risk. Preventing HIV sexual risk behavior and drug use in this group is critical to reducing the race disparity in HIV. However, research on the factors that drive and protect against HIV risk among African American male releasees is limited. Returning to a committed partner after release may be an important protective factor against HIV risk among African American male releasees during reentry. However, incarceration destabilizes committed relationships. Though 50-80% of men enter prison in a committed relationship, we estimate that half of these relationships end by the time of release. Upon release, loss of a partner may lead men to seek multiple, new partners to meet companionship needs or may lead to distress and, in turn, self-medication with drugs or sex. No prior study has evaluated the degree to which partner loss during incarceration influences post-release HIV risk. The present mixed method study is designed to address this gap in the current field of HIV prevention science. This study seeks to examine the hypothesis that dissolution of stable intimate relationships during incarceration elevates sexual risk behavior and drug use among inmates upon their release. The specific aims are: Primary Quantitative Aims: Aim 1. Among African American men in relationships at the time of prison entry, to describe the associations between dissolution of relationships during incarceration and HIV sexual risk behavior (unprotected sex; multiple sex partnerships; buying sex for money or drugs) and drug use (crack use; binge drinking). Aim 2. To assess whether diminished mental health (low coping; increased depression; increased anxiety) due to dissolution of relationships during incarceration results in HIV sexual risk behavior and drug use. Aim 3. To evaluate whether the association between dissolution of relationships during incarceration and HIV sexual risk behavior and drug use varies by respondent and relationship characteristics. Qualitative Aim: To qualitatively explore the social context of post-release and men's perceptions of the factors and processes driving post-release sexual risk behavior and drug use. To accomplish these study aims, we propose to recruit 400 African American male inmates who are scheduled to be released from prison and who were in stable intimate heterosexual relationships at the time of prison entry. Our pilot work suggests that ~50% of relationships will have ended during the incarceration. We will follow men after their release to assess whether post-release sexual risk behavior and drug use are higher among men whose relationships ended during incarceration versus men whose relationships remained intact. The proposed study is designed to inform development of policies and interventions that minimize the destabilizing effects of criminal justice involvement on relationships and health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Since more than 800,000 African American men are incarcerated in prison at any given time, and hundreds of thousands return home to their communities each year, policies and programs that are effective in reducing HIV risk in this group would prevent substantial numbers of new infections among African American men and members of their sexual networks annually. This research will determine whether dissolution of committed relationships during incarceration is a risk factor for post-release HIV sexual risk behavior and drug use among African American male releasees and will describe the pathways through which relationship dissolution may work to influence HIV risk. Study findings may highlight the need for implementation of criminal justice policies that reduce network disruption and may inform HIV prevention interventions, including in-prison programs for inmates and their partners that foster communication and prevent relationship dissolution, and pre-release HIV prevention education for men who have lost a committed partner during incarceration.           Since more than 800,000 African American men are incarcerated in prison at any given time, and hundreds of thousands return home to their communities each year, policies and programs that are effective in reducing HIV risk in this group would prevent substantial numbers of new infections among African American men and members of their sexual networks annually.

"Feasibility of recruiting nondisclosing Black MSM/W for drug use /HIV research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will investigate the feasibility of conducting ethnographic research on HIV risk among drug-using Black men who have sex with men and women but do not identify as gay or homosexual and do not disclose their same-sex activity to their female partners. Because these men do not identify as gay or homosexual, there is concern that they are not being reached by programs aimed at gay-identified communities. The specific aims are: 1) To locate and recruit for interviewing drug-using Black men who have sex with men and women (MSM/W) but do not disclose their same-sex activity to their female partners. 2) To gain a preliminary understanding of how Black MSM/W decide whether and what to disclose about their HIV risk behaviors including drug use and high risk sexual practices. Because male-to-male sexual contact is the most commonly reported HIV/AIDS transmission category among men, there is a growing body of research on MSM, including Black MSM/W. However, there appear to be no systematic investigations of patterns of drug use among Black MSM/W or on the issue of disclosing same-sex activity to female partners. There is speculation that Black MSM/W constitute a ""bridge"" population facilitating HIV infection among Black women but there is insufficient empirical evidence to substantiate the claim. The broad goal of this project is to foster further research on the relationship between drug use and HIV risk among Black adults, in order to develop a better understanding of the severe racial disparities in HIV/AIDS infection. Black men are six times more likely than White men to be infected, and Black women are 19 times as likely as White women to be infected. This project will employ two ethnographers to recruit men through four sources: 1) existing social networks established in our previous research in low-income, high-HIV neighborhoods; 2) known MSM venues such as clubs, bars, parks and street locations; 3) Internet sites and 4) groups and organizations serving drug users and ex-offenders. Five small focus groups at two points in the study will help to enhance our recruitment strategy and shape lines of inquiry regarding decisions to conceal or disclose behavior. Ethnographers will also cultivate relationships with and conduct individual interviews with 30 men to obtain preliminary insights into drug use and MSM activity, knowledge and management of HIV risk and factors influencing disclosure decisions. If the proposed feasibility study yields a successful strategy for recruiting and interviewing Black MSM/W, it can be incorporated into a subsequent larger effort (an R01) designed to collect more extensive data that can inform appropriate risk-reduction interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This feasibility study is designed to improve research on HIV risk and protective factors among drug-involved men who have sex with men and women. The study is focused on Black men who do not identify as gay or homosexual and do not disclose their same-sex activity to their female partners. Because these men do not identify as gay or homosexual, they may not be reached by prevention programs aimed at gay-identified communities. This study will identify successful strategies for recruiting and interviewing these men, with the longer-term goals of generating knowledge that can contribute to more effective interventions that may ultimately reduce racial disparities in HIV/AIDS.

"Gender Identity and HIV Risk II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a revised submission for a 5-year competitive continuation to grant 1R01-DA015269, Gender Identity and HIV Risk. The long-range goal of our research is to reduce HIV transmission among individuals stigmatized for their gender nonconformity and diversity, a goal consistent with the Healthy People 2010 objective to reduce the nation's health disparities. Key findings from our prior work were: a) a national sample of these individuals can be effectively reached via the Internet; b) differences in sex, gender identity/role, and sexual orientation are associated with important differences in HIV risk behavior; c) individuals in the female role are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection through the high risk behavior of the men with whom they interact. We propose to build on these findings by investigating the HIV risk behavior and cofactors of this population's high risk male partners (N=400), using online survey and interview methods successfully applied in the original project (Aim 1). These results will help inform the development of a theory- driven, Internet-based, HIV prevention intervention for individuals who are stigmatized for their gender non- conformity (Aim 2). The intervention will be modeled on an offline HIV intervention shown, in an uncontrolled trial, to reduce risk behavior in the target population. After user-testing and refinement of the prototype online intervention, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial (N=600) to evaluate its efficacy in improving health and reducing HIV risk behavior (Aim 3). This study is innovative in that a) few interventions exist for this minority population and even fewer have been adequately evaluated; b) the intervention will combine HIV prevention and behavior change theories with principles of e-learning; c) the entire study will be implemented online. Our team is highly experienced in HIV prevention research with diverse and vulnerable populations, the benefits/challenges of Internet-based research (online recruitment, data collection, intervention adaptation), and sexual health theory and measures. The project has public health significance in that the minority population targeted for intervention is at high risk for HIV infection, and the men with whom they interact not only pose a risk to them, but also to the general population. If proven effective, the online intervention can be implemented with little additional cost to reduce gender-related HIV risks on a large scale, nationally and internationally, even among highly stigmatized groups.           ",Gender Identity and HIV Risk II,7848992,R01HD057595,"['Time ', ' United States ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' transgender ', ' transsexual ', ' Body Image ', ' body perception ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' high risk behavior ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Role "", ' Female Roles ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' safer sex ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Collection ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Female ', ' Prevention education ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' base ', ' cofactor ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Area ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Learning ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' satisfaction ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Respondent ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Play ', ' Companions ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' instrument ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' self esteem ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Silicones ', ' Stigmata ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2010,574377,0.012674160682738618
"Encouraging Safe Dates: Reducing Intimate Partner Violence in South African Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  HIV prevalence rates in South Africa are among the highest in the world; transmission is largely heterosexual, and young people, especially young females, are disproportionately affected. It is increasingly understood that efforts to promote safer sexual practices in this vulnerable population may be undermined by high rates of intimate partner violence (IPV). Epidemiologic and ethnographic research among South African youth, much of it conducted by members of this research team, has provided data to support a model suggesting that ideologies of male superiority and cultural violence are manifested in gender inequality. In this setting, boys are encouraged to enforce the hierarchy, and to use violence to punish transgressions and stifle resultant conflicts. Girls receive little social support to protect them from such aggressive control. Alcohol and drug use are associated with higher levels of relationship conflict and a greater likelihood that violence will occur. High rates of rape and coerced sex are associated with early initiation of sex, failure to use condoms, and multiple, risky sexual partnerships, increasing risk of HIV transmission. Accordingly, it is proposed that an intervention be developed to reduce IPV among South African youth by: increasing social support for girls; questioning male norms of superiority, sexual entitlement, and control of girls; reducing alcohol and drug use; and improving communication to reduce the use of violence in resolving relationship conflicts. Efficacious interventions to delay sexual initiation, promote correct and consistent condom use, and discourage multiple risky sexual partnerships will also be integrated into the program. The intervention will be adapted from a school-based program, Safe Dates, which significantly reduced IPV among 8th and 9th grade students in the southeastern United States (Foshee, Bauman, Ennet, et al., 2004). It also will incorporate materials from two South African intervention programs, Our Times Our Choices (Drs. Zimmerman and Cupp) and Stepping Stones (Jewkes, Nduna & Jama 2002; Jewkes et al., 2007) which have shown significant effects on key outcomes. Specifically, we propose to: 1) Adapt Safe Dates for use as an intervention to reduce IPV among in- school South African adolescents and integrate interventions targeting HIV risk behavior; 2) Conduct a pilot study of the adapted Safe Dates program with in-school South African adolescents to: a) reduce IPV, the primary target of the intervention, and b) delay initiation of sex, increase condom use, decrease the number of sexual partners, and decrease risky sexual partnerships, the secondary targets of the intervention. The pilot study will employ an experimental design, a six-month follow-up period, and audio-enhanced personal digital assistants (APDAs) to optimize honest self-report. The primary goals of the proposed project are to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the adapted Safe Dates program in South Africa and to provide estimates of effect sizes, so that a randomized control trial can be designed to assess its efficacy.                ",Encouraging Safe Dates: Reducing Intimate Partner Violence in South African Youth,7779446,R34MH081792,"['Personal Digital Assistant ', ' Pocket Personal Computer ', ' Pocket PCs ', ' Personal Digital Assistant Computer ', ' Palmtop computer ', ' Palmtop ', ' Palm-top computer ', ' Palm-top ', ' Palm Pilot ', ' PDA Computer ', ' Blueberry Device ', ' BlackBerry Device ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Stifle joint ', ' Data ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' partner violence ', ' violent partner ', ' problem, partner, abuse, violent ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Distal ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Language ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' African ', ' Inequality ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' male ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Motivation ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Staging ', ' Punishment ', ' Forcible intercourse ', ' Rape ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Social Values ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' South Africa ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' Southeast US ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' Arts ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Adopted ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' Wood material ', ' Wood ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' Calculi ', ' Stone ', ' Biliary or Urinary Stones ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Heavy Drinking ', ' heavy alcohol use ', ' extreme drinking ', ' excessive ethanol ingestion ', ' excessive drinking ', ' excessive alcohol intake ', ' excessive alcohol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol consumption ', ' excess ethanol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol consumption ', ' drink heavily ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' child sexual assault ', ' youth rape ', ' pediatric rape ', ' juvenile rape ', ' child rape ', ' adolescent rape ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' early sex initiation ', ' initiation of intercourse ', ' early sexual initiation ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' alcohol prevention ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' older women ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' efficacy testing ', ' reduced alcohol use ', ' consistent condom use ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' ']",NIMH,PACIFIC INSTITUTE FOR RES AND EVALUATION,R34,2010,177147,-0.003309642672136005
"African American Young Mens Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised application is being resubmitted in response to the National Institutes of Health's Program Announcement entitled, ""Health Disparities in HIV/AIDS: Focus on African Americans"" (PA-06-069, reissued as PA-07-116), which recognizes that ""African Americans [represent] a group that has experienced exceptionally high rates of new HIV infections and worse survival rates than other ethnic/racial groups in this country."" To be sure, as we are now in the third decade of the HIV epidemic, African American men who have sex with men remain disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the US. Perhaps the most hidden segment of this population are African American young men who have sex with men (AAYMSM), who now represent the largest proportion of new infections among men who have sex with men (MSM). Though HIV prevention efforts using bar settings or community-based organizations targeting the gay community have been met with success, research indicates that many at-risk AAYMSM do not frequent these venues. Instead, large numbers of AAYMSM can be reached through the Ball and House communities. The Ball community revolves around collectives called ""Houses,"" which are racial, ethnic, and sexual minority defined communities that are characterized by groups of young men who create a family structure with an appointed ""mother,"" ""father"" and other members called ""the children."" The Houses offer members a network of friends and a place to turn to for support, positive affirming norms, collective identity, and connectedness among AAYMSM. Often young men join a House after having been rejected by their own family. The Balls, which are held several times a month, are lavish celebrations/competitions that serve as a social event for MSM of color, particularly AAYMSM. Our own research suggests that the Ball and House communities could be ideal settings in which to conduct HIV prevention research with AAYMSM. We are therefore proposing to conduct ethnographic and survey research to better understand and examine: 1) the structural, social, and cultural characteristics of the Ball and House communities; 2) Ball and House members' use of illicit drugs and involvement in HIV risk and protective behaviors, and their social and sexual networks; and 3) the role that rejection, discrimination, and internalized homophobia play with respect to encouraging drug use and HIV risk.

"Longitudinal Analysis of Transactional Sex, Violence & HIV/HSV2 in South Africa    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In South Africa, an estimated 18% of the entire population age 15-49 is HIV positive, including approximately 10% of young women aged 15-24; this epidemic is driven almost entirely by heterosexual transmission. One key dynamic affecting heterosexual HIV transmission in South Africa, particularly among young people, is financial and material exchange as an underlying motive for sexual relationships. Often referred to as transactional sex, such exchange can be an incentive for women to have sex in situations where they might otherwise refrain, and has been noted as a potential source of women's vulnerability to gender- based violence and sexual exploitation. Research with young South African men has highlighted associations between transactional sex and perpetration of both sexual assault and intimate partner violence. Transactional sex is also associated with a range of other behaviors, such as multiple and concurrent sexual partnerships and sex while intoxicated, that carry potential for increased risk of HIV infection. In South Africa, transactional sex and gender-based violence have both been associated with prevalent HIV infection in cross-sectional studies, underscoring the importance to HIV prevention of better understanding these linked phenomena. Because research on transactional sex, gender-based violence, and HIV risk has to date been only cross-sectional, our understanding of possible causal associations and potential points of intervention remains severely limited. The recently completed Stepping Stones HIV prevention trial (5R01MH064882-04; 3R01MH064882-04S2) offers a unique opportunity to explore associations between transactional sex, gender-based violence, and incident HIV and HSV-2 infection through secondary analysis of longitudinal data from a large HIV prevention trial with youth in the rural Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) Assess whether experience (for women) or perpetration (for men) of gender-based violence predicts participation in transactional sex over 24 months of follow-up among 1,252 young, rural South African women and 1,179 young, rural South African men who participated in the Stepping Stones trial and for whom follow-up data is available; (2) Assess whether participation in transactional sex predicts experience/perpetration of gender- based violence among rural South African youth over 24 months of follow-up; (3) Assess whether participation in transactional sex predicts incident HIV or HSV-2 infection over 24 months of follow-up among 1,126 young rural South African women and 1,130 young rural South African men who participated in the Stepping Stones study and have viral incidence data available; and (4) Assess whether experience or perpetration of gender- based violence predicts incident HIV or HSV-2 infection over 24 months of follow-up among rural South African youth. This study will answer key questions about the role of transactional sex and gender-based violence in shaping young people's risk of HIV infection and inform future interventions to reduce the risk of both HIV and gender-based violence among African youth.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: South Africa has the highest number of HIV infected individuals in the world, with an epidemic driven by heterosexual transmission and reinforced by high incidence of gender-based violence and inequality. Young people who are just becoming sexually active represent both a pool of extreme vulnerability and a potentially valuable point for interventions for prevent both HIV and gender-based violence. This analyses proposed here will yield a deeper understanding of the linked role of transactional sex and gender-based violence among South African youth and the extent to which transactional sex and gender- based violence impact women's and men's risk of acquiring HIV and/or HSV-2 infection, and will thereby inform development of improved prevention interventions.           Public Health Significance: South Africa has the highest number of HIV infected individuals in the world, with an epidemic driven by heterosexual transmission and reinforced by high incidence of gender-based violence and inequality.

"Syndemic Production among Emergent Adult Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent trends in U.S. urban centers indicate a rise in the number of new HIV infections in the population of young men who have sex with men (YMSM). These trends suggest a high level of vulnerability to HIV seroconversion in YMSM through sexual behavior as they emerge into adulthood. In addition, acts of sexual risk taking in this population often function synergistically with illicit drug use, and mental health burden. Despite some success with HIV prevention in the MSM population during the last 25 years, these recent patterns suggest that a reexamination of our prevention strategies for this population, especially for YMSM of color, is needed. Given the interplay that exists between unprotected sexual behavior, illicit drug use, and mental health burden, all such efforts must consider how these overlapping epidemics (also known as syndemics) fuel each other in a cohort of YMSM as they emerge into adulthood. Thus, we will we will initiate a prospective longitudinal program of research to follow the development of syndemics in a racially/ethnically and economically diverse cohort of urban HIV-negative YMSM in New York City as they transition from adolescence into young adulthood, and apply, test, and further develop a theory of syndemic production to understand the development of both maladaptive and adaptive behavioral outcomes. Specifically we seek to (1) develop and test theoretically informed measurement models of the covariance of illicit drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and mental health burden among emergent adult HIV-negative YMSM within and across time, (2) assess whether patterns of behavior are continuous, discontinuous, or some combination of both; (3) delineate the risk and protective bases-physical factors (i.e., pubertal onset, HIV status), relational factors (i.e., family history of psychopathology, current romantic relationships, peer support, and characteristics of residential, social, and sex neighborhoods), and psychosocial factors (i.e., sexual identity, internalized homophobia, hypermasculinity, racial identity, racial devaluation, HIV optimism) that predict the development of syndemics, and (4) determine the extent to which the development of syndemics varies by race/ethnicity, social class, and homelessness/housing stability in a cohort of HIV-negative YMSM. Using multiple measurement modalities, which include biological assays, calendar based methods, and self-reports, we will follow the development of 675, 18-year-old HIV-negative YMSM. Participants will be recruited through venue-based and respondent driven sampling, as they emerge into adulthood, over seven waves of data collection within a 36-month time frame. We will utilize Structural Equation and Latent Growth Curve Analysis to answer our four main research questions.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to understand why a new generation of young men who have sex with other men place themselves at risk for HIV transmission. Knowledge which we will generate will help us understand how these young men emerge into adulthood, the choices they make about sexual behavior and illicit drug use, as well as how these two behaviors interact with their mental health. We seek to understand why some men exhibit risky behaviors as they emerge into adulthood while others do not. Working with community and municipal partners, we will draw from what we have learned from both groups to develop strategies for HIV prevention and intervention that are relevant to this current and developing generation who did not live through the devastation of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980's. In addition, we will add to the methodological literature based on our analysis of nested latent growth curve models.           RELEVANCE The goal of this project is to understand why a new generation of young men who have sex with other men place themselves at risk for HIV transmission.

"Implicit Associations and Shifting Self-Definitions Across Work and Family Roles    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As social scientists, we know quite a lot about current trends regarding differential career and family outcomes for men versus women. The purpose of the current studies is to understand how ingrained cultural expectations regarding gender role distributions combine with efforts to view the self as competent and efficacious, fulfilling core roles that produce a sense of belonging and acceptance, to determine decisions regarding work and family. We argue that an asymmetry exists for the genders such that for men, fulfilling their role as a successful professional simultaneously fulfills the role of successful father. In contrast, for women the roles are in direct conflict. Performing the behavior required for mastery in the professional world necessarily detracts from performing that required for success as a mom. As a result, women who value both roles are required to shift their self-concepts when considering their goals in one role versus the other. We argue this shifting produces a sense of conflict that may contribute to women eventually choosing one identity over the other. The studies in this application examine the feasibility of this analysis by measuring implicit shifts in self- definitions and predicting these as a function of participant gender, identification with the roles, and the strength of implicit role associations pairing women with childcare and men with the professional world. Male and female students in the first two years of graduate and professional training are recruited from five different disciplines that vary in the proportion of males that make up the discipline. Men are argued to enjoy a more consistent definition of the self across the two roles and the more traditional the role associations held by an individual male, the more true this should be, perhaps resulting in even greater differences in experienced shifts in self-definitions by the genders in more male dominated fields. The greater shifts experienced by women are hypothesized to have immediate costs in cognitive functioning, state anxiety, and work-family balance self-efficacy, and over time to generate stress, depression, and lower life satisfaction, at least in the early stages of developing one's identity in the parent and professional domains. The dual roles may provide a buffer to women against threats to the self once a secure identity in each role has been established. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The past 50 years have witnessed unprecedented changes in the organization of the family with the mass entry of women into the workforce, significantly smaller family sizes, soaring divorce rates, and an increased number of single parent families. Family structure has profound implications for the well-being of individual family members and consequently, public health more generally. Understanding efforts to balance career and parenting roles in the service of preserving a sense of self-worth is a fundamental component of constructing healthy family units.           The past 50 years have witnessed unprecedented changes in the organization of the family with the mass entry of women into the workforce, significantly smaller family sizes, soaring divorce rates, and an increased number of single parent families.

"PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative (MARI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Rates of HIV infection are increasing among heterosexual young adult Black men. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advancing HIV prevention agenda calls for intervention through voluntary counseling and testing. However, young adults are less likely to be tested for HIV than older age groups and there are still large numbers of Black heterosexual men who do not get HIV tested. A goal of the study is to build HIV prevention research capacity in Black communities in which little research has been conducted. We will conduct qualitative interviews with 20 low income heterosexual young adult Black (non-Hispanic) men (ages 18-25 years) to examine barriers and facilitators to HIV testing and elicit their opinions of how to promote HIV testing among their peers. Based on the results from the qualitative interviews, a questionnaire will be developed to identify attitudes towards HIV testing, perceptions of HIV risk, socio-cultural influences (e.g., incarceration history, and male gender norms), and their relationship to HIV testing behaviors among low income heterosexual young adult Black men. Results from both the qualitative interviews and survey will be used to develop tailored educational materials that promote HIV testing among low income young adult heterosexual Black men. Three focus groups will then be conducted with low income heterosexual young adult men to evaluate the acceptability of the materials. Findings will increase our understanding of factors that influence HIV testing among Black heterosexual young adult men. In addition, HIV testing promotion materials developed through this study may have utility in increasing the number of heterosexual Black young adult men who get tested and therefore become aware of their HIV status. This proposal seeks to identify factors that influence HIV testing among low income heterosexual young adult Black men. The study will also develop tailored educational materials to promote HIV testing among this population. Specifically tailoring HIV testing messages for low income heterosexual young adult Black men may have utility in increasing the numbers among this population who get tested and therefore become aware of their HIV status. Therefore, this information may make a significant contribution to HIV prevention efforts and addresses a public health priority that fits with the goals of the US Department of Health and Human Services Healthy People 2010 initiative to eliminate health disparities related to HIV.           ","PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative (MARI)",7922500,U01PS000676,[''],NCHHSTP,ST.

"Trajectories and Consequences of Nonmarital Fathering    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this project is to investigate the factors associated with men becoming unwed fathers and the nature and consequences of unmarried fathers' involvement with children. This is an important topic, given the large and growing number of men who will have at least one child outside of marriage and the large fraction of children and mothers who will be exposed to their fathering behavior. Yet, our knowledge about nonmarital fathering and how it affects partners, children, and the fathers themselves remains limited, in part because men are often under-represented in national surveys. Fathers represent an important resource for children, ideally investing the time, money and emotion that promote healthy child development and socialization, but unwed fathers often have individual and contextual characteristics that deter and complicate their potential for positive involvement in family life; these include low human capital, high rates of social-behavioral problems, and a high likelihood of living away from their child, as well as three important but little explored factors related to nonmarital fathering fathers' ongoing relationships with mothers (whether romantic and/or co-parenting), the fact that unmarried men (and women) often have children by multiple partners (so-called `multi-partnered fertility'), and the fact that a non-trivial number of unwed fathers have been or will be incarcerated. Using three national datasets (the National Survey of Family Growth, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, and the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study), this research will provide new information about the trajectories and consequences of recent and contemporary nonmarital fathering. The study includes three specific aims: 1) To evaluate the antecedents of nonmarital fatherhood and the effects of becoming an unwed father on the male life course; 2) To analyze the nature and dynamics of unwed fathers' involvement in families as partners and parents, especially as linked to relationships with mothers, multi-partnered fertility, and paternal incarceration; and 3) To examine the consequences of unmarried fathers' involvement for the wellbeing of children and of fathers themselves, including whether the benefits are moderated by fathers' characteristics or context. Using a life course perspective and drawing on family systems theory, this project will evaluate key stages and turning points in men becoming and then being unmarried fathers, including factors that both enhance and deter positive parenting over time. The study will explore race/ethnic differences in unwed fathering and consider key analytic challenges related to social selection and missing data. Overall, this study will provide new information about the process, content, and consequences of nonmarital fathering for children and families and may shed light on the development of sound policies and programs to strengthen families. PUBLIC HELATH RELEVANCE This study will provide new information about the factors associated with men becoming unwed fathers and the nature and consequences of unmarried fathers' involvement with children. Given the rising fraction of births that occur outside of marriage and the negative consequences of father absence for children, this study will provide information to aid the development of sound policies and programs to keep fathers connected to children and to strengthen families across diverse contexts.             ",Trajectories and Consequences of Nonmarital Fathering,7920001,R01HD057894,"['Demography ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Provider ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Economics ', ' Emotions ', ' Employment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Fertility ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' partner violence ', ' violent partner ', ' problem, partner, abuse, violent ', ' Affect ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Investments ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' male ', ' Marriage ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Mothers ', ' Multiple Partners ', ' Parents ', ' Staging ', ' fatherhood ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Socialization ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' sound ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Systems Theory ', ' Time ', ' Unmarried Father ', ' Woman ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' father role ', ' paternity ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Generations ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Unmarried ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' nonmarital childbearing ', ' premarital childbearing ', ' human capital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' child bearing ', ' childbearing ', ' bearing children ', ' bear children ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2010,156204,0.0426578223555679
"Tailoring ""Real Men Are Safe"" for African American and Hispanic Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses two broad Challenge Areas, (05) Comparative Effectiveness Research and (09) Health Disparities, and specific Challenge Topics, 05-MD-102 Prevention of Chronic Diseases in Disparity Populations , and 09-DA-101 Health disparities and access to participation in research. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that Blacks and Hispanics are overrepresented among men with HIV infection compared to Whites. The Clinical Trial Network (CTN) of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) recently completed a randomized clinical trial evaluating the utility of the Real Men Are Safe (REMAS) HIV prevention intervention targeting men in substance abuse treatment. Men assigned to the REMAS groups engaged in fewer unprotected vaginal and anal intercourse occasions during the 90 days prior to the 3- and 6-month post-intervention follow-ups than men assigned to a standard HIV Education group. Post hoc analyses suggest Whites benefited more from the intervention than African Americans, and possibly Hispanics. The challenge proposed in this application is to revise the REMAS intervention, shown to be effective in the multisite CTN trial, to be more culturally relevant to African American and Hispanic participants. A two phase study is proposed for revising the REMAS intervention. In Phase 1 we will conduct formative research by convening a panel of academic and community based experts knowledgeable in HIV prevention in African American and Hispanic communities. Utilizing the Delphi process panel members will review the REMAS materials and make suggestions for revisions. The panel will be asked to help develop a revised version of the REMAS intervention which would be culturally viable for a mixed group of whites, African Americans and Hispanics. In phase 2 the revised REMAS version would be pilot tested for feasibility and acceptability in four community treatment programs within the NIDA CTN which have high percentages of either African American and/or Hispanic clientele. Prior research has demonstrated that the Real Men Are Safe (REMAS) HIV prevention intervention has been effective in helping men in substance abuse treatment lessen their sexual risk behavior. However, the intervention appeared to be more effective with whites as compared to African Americans and possibly Hispanics. The goal of this research is to develop a version of REMAS culturally tailored to be appropriate with African American and Hispanic men.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Prior research has demonstrated that the Real Men Are Safe (REMAS) HIV prevention intervention has been effective in helping men in substance abuse treatment lessen their sexual risk behavior.

"Sexual Partnerships Among African American Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although young people ages 15 to 24 years represent only a quarter of the sexually experienced population, they represent nearly half of all new sexually transmitted diseases (STD). This group is at increased risk for HIV and STD acquisition due to biological, behavioral, and cultural factors. Literature indicates that women, compared to men, are significantly more likely to report a partner having concurrent sexual partnerships, 17% versus 8% respectively. With the alarmingly disproportionate prevalence of HIV and AIDS cases among African American women, recent research points towards the impact of concurrency to address this racial and gender disparity. Having concurrent sexual partnerships increases the likelihood of STD transmission among partners. Having sex within a network of partners with high STD and HIV rates further increases the risk of STD transmission. The goal of this research is to explore and understand the context of having multiple, or concurrent, sex partners among young African American women aged 18 to 25 in heterosexual partnerships. This study is grounded in the theory of gender and power and outcome expectancies, or incentives, as described in the social cognitive theory. The Specific Aims are to 1) understand the reasons young adults engage in concurrent sexual partnerships, 2) identify and understand condom use in the context of concurrent sexual partnerships, and 3) propose a framework for understanding the context of and factors related to concurrency among African American young women. Women will be selected from an ongoing study and invited to participate in the present study. The study will recruit African American young women (n=40) aged 18 to 25 years to participate in semi-structured interviews lasting 45 to 60 minutes. Interview transcripts will be coded using Nvivo 8.0 software, calculating inter-rater agreement and using thematic coding for themes that emerge. Quantitative data will be collected after completing the semi- structured interviews and will recruit a new sample (n=250) of African American women. The computerized survey includes measures of self-reported STD history, sexual history, self-reported sexual behaviors, as well as beliefs and attitudes related to sexual partnerships, concurrency, partner variables, drug and alcohol use, depression, education, and income. The study will propose a path model based on factors significantly predictive of concurrency. This study will contribute to the literature by examining additional factors based on the theory of gender and power and social cognitive theory. Survey data will be analyzed using SPSS 17.0 and path models will be analyzed using LISREL 8.0.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Concurrent sexual partnerships have been identified as a mode of increased HIV and STD transmission. This study proposes to conduct a mixed methodology examination of the context of concurrency among African American young women, using semi- structured interviews (n=40) and computerized surveys (n=250).           Project Narrative Concurrent sexual partnerships have been identified as a mode of increased HIV and STD transmission.

"Health Disparities Among a Vulnerable Population:  A Longitudinal Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research project will investigate sexual minority health disparities during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood. The Healthy People 2010 (NCHS 2000) initiative identifies sexual minorities as a key population of interest regarding health disparities, and an emerging field of research is beginning to document these inequalities. These health disparities include many ""key national indicators of well-being"" identified by NICHD (2008). The existing research on sexual minorities, however, has several limitations: 1) it is largely based on clinical and community samples; 2) it relies on cross sectional data sets; 3) it is often limited to one dichotomous indicator of sexual orientation; 4) it often ignores environmental influences, and 5) it has examined only a small number of health related outcomes. Given these limitations, this research is poised to make important contributions to the existing literature as well as public policy but improving upon the existing data, methods, and frameworks utilized. Specifically, this research will utilize nationally representative, longitudinal data and several indicators of same-sex orientation to investigate a wide variety of health outcomes including suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, self-reported health, self-reported morbidities, and a series of biomarkers designed to measure anthropometric, cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammation functioning. In addition to using these cutting-edge data, we will employ a series of innovative statistical techniques including generalized linear models, propensity score matching, multi-level models, and latent curve models. Critically, this work will employ an interdisciplinary, ""ecosocial"" framework that stresses the synergistic impact of individual, environmental, and biological level processes on health. Preliminary analyses conducted by the authors provide compelling evidence that the timing and patterns of sexual minority status identification are important pathways through which health outcomes are shaped. This research will build upon these preliminary findings and directly address the criticisms of previous work from an interdisciplinary framework that incorporates social, psychological, and biological processes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposal specifically addresses a target population and goals identified by the Healthy People 2010 initiative (NCHS 2000) and will document previously unexplored longitudinal trends in sexual minority health from an ""ecosocial"" framework. The study of sexual minority status and health provides a unique opportunity to examine disparities among a vulnerable population distributed across all race/ethnic and socioeconomic groups, allowing us to examine health trajectories in a variety of contexts. This research will generate important findings for public health policy by identifying both positive and negative pathways through which the relationship between sexual minority status and health are mediated.            Relevance To Public Health: This proposal specifically addresses a target population and goals identified by the Healthy People 2010 initiative (NCHS 2000) and will document previously unexplored longitudinal trends in sexual minority health from an ""ecosocial"" framework.

"Sex Differences: Pathophysiology of Symptomatic Non-Obstructive Coronary Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K23 Career Development Award application has been designed to launch the academic research career of the candidate, Dr. Jennifer Tremmel. Dr. Tremmel is a Cardiologist at Stanford, trained in both preventive and interventional cardiology, whose career goals are to become an independent clinical investigator and thought leader in the fields of women's cardiovascular health and sex differences in cardiovascular disease. Her career development plan centers on the research question of whether or not there is a sex difference in the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease. Specifically, she asks if women presenting with symptoms suggestive of angina, but demonstrating no angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease, are more likely than similarly presenting men to have coronary endothelial dysfunction, coronary microvascular disease, and diffuse deposition of coronary atherosclerotic plaque. Her specific aims are: 1. To compare the incidence and severity of coronary endothelial dysfunction between women and men using intracoronary acetylcholine (Ach) and quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). 2. To compare the incidence and severity of coronary microvascular disease between women and men using the coronary pressure wire to measure coronary flow reserve (CFR) and the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR). 3. To compare the epicardial artery atherosclerotic burden and distribution between women and men using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Her development plan is designed around this research, focusing on development in four key areas: 1) Sex- Based Medicine, 2) Advanced Statistical Analysis and Data Interpretation, 3) Vascular Biology, and 4) Non- invasive techniques for assessing endothelial function and coronary pathophysiology. This development will allow her to successfully conduct her research proposal and will prepare her for the next phase of her career as an independent investigator. Dr. Tremmel will be conducting her research in a premier academic environment under the supervision of outstanding mentors and collaborators. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This research has a direct relevance to public health. The burden of cardiovascular disease is great and there is a growing body of evidence describing differences between the sexes. Continued investigation into these sex differences will add to our knowledge regarding sex-based outcome disparities and should prompt a change in our current approach to diagnosis and treatment, particularly among women.

"Health-Seeking Behaviors among Men with Criminal Justice and Substance Abuse Hist    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed training program will focus on cancer risks, screening behaviors and preventive health care among men returning to the community after incarceration. Individuals who have extensive criminal justice histories have disproportionately high rates of smoking, greater burden of viral infections associated with cancer (e.g., hepatitis, HPV, HIV) and greater barriers to establishing and obtaining routine health care. Although efforts are underway to connect people to health care settings upon release, there is an absence of evidence about men's health-seeking behaviors after returning to the community. Little is known about men's motivations and intentions to participate in screening, prevention or treatment, or about contextual factors that affect their health behavior.        A five year research and training program is proposed to prepare the principal investigator for a career in cancer-health disparities and participatory health services research focused on socially-marginalized, at-risk groups, such as former prisoners. The candidate's long-term goals are to advance her skills in community-partnered research, research design and psychometric development of measures. This program will build upon her strong background in HIV/AIDS, community practice and qualitative research, by providing a deeper understanding of factors that foster cancer-related health disparities among men with histories of criminal justice and substance abuse problems. Specific training objectives are: 1) to become proficient in the development, design, and use of psychometrically-sound instruments to measure health-seeking behavior among high-risk, socioeconomically disadvantaged men; 2) to gain experience with participatory research methods, in order to maximize former offenders' involvement in research and engagement in interventions to increase their use of needed health services; 3) to learn about the design of multilevel health services interventions, in order to create a program focusing on ethnic minority men with extensive criminal justice and substance abuse histories, and; 4) to develop an understanding of the ethical issues that enter into health services research among people recently released from the criminal justice system.        Structured training activities involve coursework in methodology, psychometrics/scale development, biostatistics, epidemiology, bioethics, advanced data analysis, and correctional health research. Mentors and advisors will provide additional readings, research supervision and consultation. The research and training activities will be pursued through the Division of Community Collaboration and Implementation Science in the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine with senior researchers in a number of institutions including Columbia University and the University of Michigan. This training will provide an important foundation for collaborative planning of evidence-based community health services for this population.        The proposed research will examine the health-related needs and health-seeking behaviors of 300 men ages 35-64 that have criminal justice and substance abuse histories in New York City. Specific aims are: 1) to explore unmet health and psychosocial needs and quality of life among ethnic minority men who have extensive criminal justice and substance histories; 2) to assess health-seeking behaviors among these men, including influences on their decisions to participate in cancer screening, prevention and treatment; 3) to describe contextual barriers and facilitators that affect men's use of services; and 4) to evaluate the reliability and validity of instruments developed or adapted for use with men with criminal justice and substance use histories. In addition to characterizing men's health concerns, this study will describe barriers and facilitators to seeking care and treatment as well as the complex set of circumstances (e.g. health/illness, parenting, vocational skills, housing stability, employment, and social support) that may impede men's ability to prioritize their health care needs.        Research and training activities described in this proposal are intended to develop the community connections, preliminary data and research skills necessary for the candidate to launch an independent program of community intervention research, designed to improve health and well-being and reduce cancer burden among vulnerable and largely disenfranchised segments of our society.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed K01 Research Scientist Development Award title, ""Health Seeking among Men with Criminal Justice and Substance Abuse Histories"" has serious relevance to public health agenda and priorities. Of the 7.3 million adults who are under some form of correctional supervision (e.g., probation, parole, prison and jail inmates), ethnic minority men are four times as likely than whites and nearly 2.5 times as likely to be under correctional supervision[40]. Nationwide, many states are recognizing that chronic and infectious diseases are concentrated in correctional populations and the punitive responses to nonviolent offenders are no longer a viable, economical option. Once these men return to the community, men who have extensive criminal justice and substance abuse histories often have unequal or lack access to health care services and fail to continue treatments that were initiated during incarceration[42]. Not only do ex-offenders report a wide array of problems and unmet health needs, but cancer-health disparities also exist. The proposed study contributes to the area of cancer-health disparities research and is consistent with NCI's strategic plan to chart the risk trajectories that may contribute to cancer and other adverse health conditions among vulnerable and disadvantaged populations.           Public Health Relevance.

"Cultural Scripts Influencing HIV Prevention Among African American Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The African American female population is profoundly and disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted epidemics. Despite comprising less than 14% of the female population in 2005 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2008) Black women represented approximately 64% of all U.S. women living with HIV/AIDS, the majority of whom contracted the HIV virus through heterosexual contact (CDC, 2008). In Washington, DC in particular, the disparity is even more striking: between 2001 and 2006, Black women accounted for 92% of all reported HIV cases among women (Government of the District of Colombia Department of Health, 2007). In light of these alarming statistics, an enhanced understanding of the impact of sociocultural factors specific to women of this ethnic group on their participation in unsafe sexual behavior is of utmost importance. Recent literature has emphasized the role of culturally transmitted guidelines and expectations about sexual behavior in perpetuating the epidemic among this population, suggesting that such specifications encourage unsafe sexual practices (Stephens & Phillips, 2003). However, the relationship of such expecations to African American women's perceived capacity to assert themselves in enacting sexual safety (e.g., by enforcing condom use or refusing unwanted sex) is lacking empirical attention. The purpose of the proposed study is to address this gap in the literature by developing a measure of sexual expectations and examining the relationship of such expectations to sexual self-concept and sexual self-efficacy within a sample of HIV-positive and high-risk, HIV-negative African American women living in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Researchers at The George Washington University will collaborate with the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) to access the targeted population. A sample of approximately 191 African American women between the ages of 21 and 69, approximately three quarters of whom are HIV-positive, will be recruited from the existing WIHS sample. Participant interviews (n=8) and a focus group comprised of 8 women will inform instrument development, and quantitative measures will be administered to 175 women in paper-and-pencil, self-report format during regularly scheduled WIHS clinic visits. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study is of public health importance in that it will clarify barriers to sexual safety among African American women, a vulnerable and underserved population at high risk for contracting and transmitting the HIV virus. Findings will be useful in informing the development of culturally appropriate intervention programs targeting this group, ultimately aiding the effort to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic within and beyond the African American community.           ",Cultural Scripts Influencing HIV Prevention Among African American Women,8033715,F31MH085584,"['Behavior ', ' Body Image ', ' body perception ', ' age group ', ' metropolitan ', ' intervention program ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' high risk behavior ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Measures ', ' Chlamydia ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Mediating ', ' Schedule ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Colombia ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Population ', ' 21 year old ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' Abstinence ', ' high risk ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Reducing HIV Heterosexual Risk Among African-American Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A large gap exists between the prevention needs of African-American, heterosexual men and the number and quality of programs demonstrated to meet these needs. Men who identify or are classified as Black are at increased risk, as compared to other racial/ethnic groups, for HIV infection acquired through heterosexual risk behavior. An important challenge is to design effective, sustainable programs that have potential to target this population and that can address multiple levels of factors that impact HIV-related behaviors. The barbershop setting is one venue that has significant promise as a vehicle for delivery of such programs, as this setting is widely and frequently used, has potential to build upon extant and trusting relationships, and can help promote a normative environment in support of behavior change. Investigators at SUNY Downstate Medical Center and the Arthur Ashe Institute of Urban Health, Inc. will build on their success in developing, implementing, and evaluating health promotion activities administered in community settings such as hair salons and barbershops by developing a program that will reach heterosexual men in barbershops serving communities with high HIV morbidity and AIDS- related mortality. We propose to: (1) Develop a steering committee consisting of key community stakeholders, representatives from organizations comprising our existing community partnerships, program investigators, and other key informants, (2) Conduct qualitative and quantiative formative evaluation to describe key individual and contextual level factors related to risk behavior in this population, and (3) design, implement, and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a theory-based behavioral intervention to reduce the burden of HIV. This three- year program will focus on development of the relationships, resources, infrastructure, and preliminary data necessary to implement and evaluate full-scale intervention programs designed to address these issues. This program seeks to design a community-based HIV prevention program that meets the needs of African American heterosexual men. As such, this proposal will meet a priority need as identified by our community, seek to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in disease as evidenced by epidemiologic data, and address the Healthy People 2010 overall goals to ""Prevent human immunodeficiency virus infection and its related illness and death"" and to ""Promote responsible sexual behaviors, strengthen community capacity, and increase access to quality services to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and their complications.""

"A Brief, Clinic-Based, HIV Prevention Program for African American Teen Males    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has declared that AIDS is a ""state of emergency"" in the US relative to African Americans. Teen males attending STD clinics are one important, yet often neglected, population of African Americans at risk of HIV acquisition. Despite extremely high rates of STD acquisition (and subsequent infection) among this population, effective clinic-based interventions specifically designed to reduce their sexual risk behavior for STD/HIV have not been developed/disseminated. A recent intervention trial (conducted by Dr. Crosby) demonstrated the efficacy of a brief, clinic-based, intervention designed to prevent subsequent STI acquisition among African American males 18 to 29 years of age. The proposed study will test the efficacy this intervention (in modified form) to reduce STI incidence among African American teen (15 to 20 years old). The primary hypothesis is that teens randomized to receive the intervention will have a lower incidence rate of laboratory-confirmed STIs at 2 and 6-month follow-up assessments (as well as 12-month follow-up conducted by a medical records review) compared to those receiving an attention-equivalent control condition. Teens (N = 840) will be recruited from a publicly-funded STD clinic located in an urban area of the South. After completing an A-CASI assessment, teens will be rated on their ability to apply condoms to a penile model and then asked to donate a urine specimen for STI testing. Specimens will be tested for C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and T. Vaginalis using nucleic acid amplification assays. Randomization will then be achieved by a concealment of allocation technique. Teens will be randomized to immediately receive: 1) a brief (60 minute) theory-based, one-on-one, interactive intervention delivered by a lay health advisor or 2) an attention equivalent control condition. The assessment battery will be repeated 2 months subsequent to enrollment and again 6 months after enrollment. A medical records review will be conducted 12 months after enrollment to compare clinic reported incidence rates between the randomized groups of teens. If incidence of STIs in this population of teens can be decreased as substantially as was found in the previous study of 18 to 29 year-old African American males (percent relative difference = 36.7), the public health significance for African American teen males will substantially contribute to rectify the racial disparity in HIV/STD experienced by African American teen males. By extension, we suggest that their partners (typically African American teen females) will also benefit. Because our program is designed for ease of implementation, the number of dissemination and translation issues will be greatly minimized thereby greatly facilitating the process of translating research into practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed efficacy trial tests an innovative method of bridging the gap between research and practice. By providing a brief, clinic-based, HIV/STD prevention program to African American teen males attending an STD clinic, the study will be the first to demonstrate that teen's sexual risk behavior can be reduced without excessive time and resources. The focus on African American teen males is also quite timely given the recent declaration by CDC that AIDS is a ""state of emergency"" for African Americans.          ","A Brief, Clinic-Based, HIV Prevention Program for African American Teen Males",7841821,R01MH083621,"['Health Educators ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Caring ', ' Age-Years ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Goals ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Kentucky ', ' Laboratories ', ' post intervention ', ' Funding ', ' male ', ' Medical Records ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Neisseria gonorrhoeae ', ' N.gonorrhoeae ', ' N. gonorrhoeae ', ' Gonococcus ', ' Glare ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' Perception ', ' Brothers ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Trichomonas Infections ', ' trichomoniasis ', ' Trichomonosis ', ' Disease due to Trichomonadidae ', ' Trichomonas vaginalis ', ' T. vaginalis ', ' United States ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Attention ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' condoms ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' Reporting ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Chlamydia ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Instruction ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' avoid sex ', ' neglect ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 20 year old ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' safer sex ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' research to practice ', ' research into practice ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' follow up assessment ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' arm ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2010,366250,0.032206087984981945
"Young Women With Acute Myocardial Infarction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young women with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) represent an extreme phenotype in ischemic heart disease risk and, at the same time, constitute a large understudied group with excess mortality risk compared with similarly aged men. This combination of adverse risk and inadequate investigation provides a critically important opportunity to address the care and outcomes of young women with AMI to uncover key biological and environmental determinants of their prognosis. Accordingly, we propose the first large, comprehensive, observational study of young women with AMI (YWAMI). YWAMI will include 2,000 women, 18-55 years of age, with AMI and a comparison cohort of 1,000 men enrolled over 3 years from 88 hospitals across the United States and in Canada. To accomplish these aims we have assembled a team of leading researchers in sex disparities in cardiovascular disease, outcomes research, epidemiology, statistics, genetics, biomarker research, health status measurement, psychosocial research, cardiology, and emergency medicine. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) characterize sex differences in outcomes following AMI (including mortality, hospitalization and health status); 2) determine sex differences in the prevalence of demographic, clinical, and psychosocial risk factors; 3) determine sex differences in quality of care; and 4) determine sex differences in the prevalence of selected biological factors (including sex hormones, biomarkers and genetic variations). We will characterize these differences in great detail and elucidate the biological and environmental factors that are responsible for disparities in outcomes. The analyses from all four aims will be used to develop clinically useful risk-stratification models for young AMI patients, explain sex differences in outcomes and identify targets for intervention. We will also bank serum and DMA from each subject, creating a resource for anticipated future studies of the molecular biology of AMI in young women and men. We will work with the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association and VHA, Inc. to disseminate findings from this study that can be used to improve the prevention, care, and outcomes for young women and men with AMI. Public Health Implications: Overall, although heart disease in young women accounts for as many deaths as breast cancer, few studies have addressed the biological, environmental and social factors that influence their outcome. Young women with heart attacks have a higher risk of dying than similarly aged men. We propose to conduct the largest, most comprehensive study of young women with heart attacks to identify the key determinants of their recovery and discover knowledge that will assist us in improving their care.              ",Young Women With Acute Myocardial Infarction,7665331,R01HL081153,"['Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' heart disease risk ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Symptoms ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogenic Compounds ', ' Estrogenic Agents ', ' Caring ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Prognostic Factor ', ' Prognostic/Survival Factor ', ' General Prognostic Factor ', ' Stratification ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Genetic Status ', ' Observational Study ', ' Update ', ' sex ', ' Cardiac ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Female ', ' Guidelines ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' improved ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Reproductive History ', ' Reproductive Issues ', ' Reproductive History Epidemiology ', ' Reproductive Factors ', ' Inflammation ', ' Inpatients ', ' Ensure ', ' prognostic ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Recovery ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' American Heart Association ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Menstrual cycle ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' Patients ', ' Metabolic ', ' Phenotype ', ' Genetic ', ' Physicians ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' sex steroid ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Biologic Marker ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' lipid metabolism ', ' fat metabolism ', ' cohort ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Canada ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Cardiology ', ' Cardiovascular Disease (Specialty) ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' social ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' genetic resource ', ' Accounting ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' comparison group ', ' neglect ', ' genetic variant ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' older women ', ' high risk ', ' biomarker ', ' non-genetic ', ' nongenetic ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' ']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,3068129,0.03916140872141774
"Web-Based Intervention for Black Bisexually-Active Men    Description (provided by the applicant): African Americans are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS, and this disparity is further evident among bisexually-active African American men (BAAM).Yet, there is insufficient knowledge regarding sexual risk behaviors of BAAM and the context in which they occur. To date, no interventions in the literature with demonstrated efficacy in reducing HIV-related sexual risk behaviors have been developed and evaluated for BAAM who do not inject drugs. The proposed study will develop and test the efficacy and acceptability of an innovative individually-tailored and culturally-sensitive 6-session online-delivered video intervention that simultaneously targets multiple domains of socio-cultural, structural-level factors, and contextual factors related to HIV risk behavior among BAAM, relative to an attention control (education) condition. This intervention is theoretically informed both in content (using the Information-Motivation-Behavior Skills model) and delivery (using tenets of Social Cognitive theory) and will feature peer BAAM. Both behavioral and biologic outcomes will be measured. Using respondent-driven sampling, a total of 120 BAAM will be enrolled and randomly assigned to either treatment or education-control conditions. They will be longitudinally tracked for six months (assessed at Baseline, month 3, and month 6). In addition to determining the prevalence of lifetime and recent HIV-associated risk behavior among BAAM,   this study seeks to evaluate the impact of a brief intervention across three domains over time: (1)   intentions/motivations to reduce HIV-associated risk behavior, (2) self-reported HIV-associated risk behavior, and (3) health/prevention knowledge and self-efficacy skills. The long term goal of the proposed project is to develop an empirically validated HIV/STI prevention program that can be delivered online BAAM. Consistent with the R34 mechanism, the final product will be the basis for   an R01 application to conduct a large-scale efficacy study in this population. Should this intervention   demonstrate effective, it will be a cost feasible approach to preventing HIV transmissions among BAAM, delivered via the medium where many men who have sex with men (including BAAM) actively meet sex partners (i.e., the Internet). Finally, the model for this intervention can easily be adopted by HIV service providers and delivered outside of traditional clinical setting with a variety of populations.            7. Project Narrative The findings of this study will facilitate a more nuanced understanding of HIV-associated risk behaviors of bisexually-active African American men (BAAM) and the context in which they occur, which will, in turn, inform prevention and intervention efforts. Specifically, the findings will inform HIV prevention, interventions, and treatments designed to reduce HIV associated risk behaviors.

Women of color and low-income women in the United States also have disproportionately high rates of HIV infection and AIDS diagnosis. Recent studies have shown that racial disparities in incarceration can be linked to health disparities, including disparities in HIV/AIDS. Research exploring how the disproportionate levels of HIV/AIDS among incarcerated men and among low-income women of color are related is crucial. The proposed study will be conducted with both members of male-female couples in which the male partner was recently released from prison and is under parole supervision (""male parolees""). The specific aims of the proposed study are: 1) Using quantitative methods, we will assess the HIV-risk behaviors of each member of the couple and identify individual-level and couple-level psychosocial influences on HIV risk and risk reduction; 2) Using qualitative methods, we will describe the unique influence of the context of a man's incarceration on couples' decision-making processes involving HIV risk and risk reduction; 3) Using quantitative and qualitative methods, we will investigate how males' and females' perspectives on HIV risk and risk reduction influence both their own behavior and behavior within the couple. Our preliminary studies have underscored the complexities of understanding how the context of a man's incarceration influences couples' decision-making processes involving HIV risk and risk reduction and have compelled us to undertake couple-level research on this issue. Public-health researchers have identified the necessity of developing and providing population-specific HIV interventions and services for people affected by incarceration both in prison and in their home neighborhoods post-release. The proposed research will yield critical information about HIV risk and risk reduction in dyadic relationships between male parolees and their female partners that can be used to develop population-appropriate and effective interventions for the millions of low-income people of color who experience their own or their partner's incarceration each year.           ",HIV Risk among Male Parolees and their Female Partners,7862385,R01MH078743,"['men ', "" men's "", ' Couples ', ' Decision Making ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Dreams ', ' dreaming ', ' Low income ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Process ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Left ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Link ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Gender Relations ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Prisoner ', ' jail inmate ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' Prisons ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' programs ', ' Supervision ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Behavior ', ' behavior change ', ' information gathering ', ' experience ', ' AIDS diagnosis ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' parolee ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' parole ', ' Emotional ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Color ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' service intervention ', ' Psychosocial Influences ', ' Psychosocial Issues ', ' effective intervention ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2010,297069,0.02642058589971276
"Syndemic Development and HIV Risk Among Vulnerable Young Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall purpose of this competitive revision application is to expand our knowledge of the socio-sexual networks of young men who have sex with men (YMSM). Basic research on these networks, and the degree of their overlap, will increase our understanding of network processes related to a cluster of health issues disproportionally experienced by YMSM. This group has an alarming HIV/AIDS prevalence, and is one of the only risk groups showing an increasing rate of infections. This epidemic of HIV among YMSM does not exist in a vacuum; YMSM experience multiple health disparities, including elevated rates of illicit drug use, exposure to violence, and mental health problems, know as a syndemic, which is associated with HIV risk. Under the parent award on which the revision application is based, we have begun to gather of sample of 450 YMSM, ages 16-20, using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) to investigate this syndemic of psychosocial health issues linked to HIV and characterizing multiple trajectories of syndemic development across 2 years. The two overarching goals of the parent study are to: 1) to provide much-needed epidemiological data on the prevalence of HIV and related health issues in order to inform public health priorities; and 2) to collect vital information on individual-level risk and protective factors to inform the development of an intervention targeting this vulnerable population. In keeping with the goals of NOT-OD-10-033, ""NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications (R01, R03, R15, R21, R21/R33 and R37) for AIDS- related Research through the NIH Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network (OppNet),"" we intend to conduct research that advances our basic understanding of social systems of relevance to HIV risk and prevention. Network-based research is a priority area of HIV-related investigation, however very little is known about the basic structure and characteristics of these networks or their influence on HIV-related risk and other clustering health issues in YMSM. Social support theory and the growing literature on sexual network epidemiology guide our two aims: 1) to identify and describe the socio-sexual network structure of YMSM; 2) to establish the comparative value of social and sexual network methods, versus traditional individual-level measures, in predicting individual syndemic outcomes. Our network-based study reflects basic behavioral and social sciences approaches to understanding socio-sexual network processes, and will inform the field about the comparative value of this more resource-intensive methodology. Novel features of this study include assessment of three types of network structure (social, sexual, substance using) integrated into the parent study, which includes longitudinal assessment of psychological and HIV/STD biomarker outcomes and processes. Findings will be used to guide future prevention and intervention efforts by identifying network factors and processes that influence risk from mid/late adolescence through emerging adulthood to reduce extremely high rates of HIV infection in this population.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) have an alarming HIV/AIDS prevalence, and are one of the only risk groups showing an increasing rate of infections in recent years.

"Risk factors related to smoking disparities among sexual minority young adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research consistently demonstrates higher smoking rates - up to 50 to 70 percent higher - among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (i.e., LGB or sexual minority) populations than the general population. However, crucial research efforts remain to determine the etiology for these disparities, especially in qualifying the roles of familial, socio-cultural, and psychological factors unique to sexual minorities. Specifically, violence and discrimination have been associated with risk behaviors and poor mental and physical health among racial/ethnic groups, but relatively little research has looked at these sequelae among sexual minorities. Moreover, there is a paucity of research on types of cessation behaviors and facilitating/inhibiting factors associated with cessation behaviors among sexual minorities. Consistent with National Institute on Drug Abuse epidemiological research foci of studying 1) multiple factors that influence drug use and 2) pathways of psychosocial mechanisms associated with drug use, the long-term goal of this project is to enhance current understanding of cessation behaviors and risk factors that singularly and additively contribute to smoking disparities among sexual minority persons. Through a mixed-methods approach using a cross-sectional, web-based survey, this project specifically aims to recruit a sample of young adult (18 to 24 years of age) sexual minority young adults to: (1) identify risk factors associated with smoking; (2) explore pathways of risk factors associated with smoking; and (3) examine cessation behaviors and facilitating/inhibiting factors associated with smoking cessation. By enhancing current understanding of what confers singular and additive risk among sexual minorities, the results of this project can be used to inform critical prevention and intervention strategies and to generate theoretical models of risk and resiliency unique to sexual minorities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tobacco-related problems are a Leading Health Indicator in Healthy People 2010

"Reducing Sexual Risk Behaviors among Rural African-American Cocaine Users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV and other sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates continue to rise disproportionately among African-Americans, and particularly dramatically among rural populations. Stimulant use, especially cocaine use, among rural African-Americans is also increasing, and is related to multiple risk behaviors for HIV/STI, including sex with multiple partners, exchanging sex for drugs and other commodities, and inconsistent condom use. Despite these documented risk patterns, and the increasing disparities in HIV/STI incidence, few theory-based interventions have been specifically designed and tested for rural African-American populations with high-risk behavioral patterns. The primary aims of this project are to adapt an existing risk reduction program to the needs of rural African-American cocaine users, to test the adapted intervention's efficacy via a behavioral clinical trial, and to answer outstanding questions regarding intraclass correlation and sampling methodologies in the sexual risk reduction literature. The project team will conduct a longitudinal intervention study with stratified group randomization, so that participants receive the sexual risk intervention or an active control intervention condition in groups. Each intervention condition is equivalent in terms of contact time and in terms of number and type of contacts (each participant receives two group sessions, two individual sessions, two community-building sessions, and two follow-up ""booster"" sessions over four months). Respondent-driven sampling will be used to recruit and enroll 280 participants across two rural, predominantly African-American counties in the Arkansas Delta region to one of the two intervention conditions. The primary outcome variables will include condom use skills, sexual negotiation skills, and self-reported risk behaviors. Additional measures, including self-efficacy for decreased sexual risk, perceived peer norms for sexual risk, perceived benefits and barriers of sexual risk reduction, social support and social trust, mental health status, partner violence, and substance use, will also be collected to assess their theory-based mediating and moderating influences on the sexual risk skills and behaviors. Assessments will be conducted prior to the intervention, immediately post-intervention, and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. This project brings together a strong, experienced investigative team which has an established, trusting relationship with the community that will be involved in the study.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The project not only will provide critically-needed information about the efficacy of tailored behavioral interventions among rural African-Americans at high risk for HIV/STIs, but also will allow the study team to investigate important methodological questions about the use of respondent- driven sampling approaches in rural settings and about intraclass correlation coefficients for sexual risk measures in tight-knit rural communities. This research can thus make important contributions that address racial disparities in HIV/STIs, provide approaches for slowing the rapid growth of the epidemics in rural areas, and inform

"Syndemic Development and HIV Risk Among Vulnerable Young Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the number of new HIV infections has been relatively stable since late 1990s, the face of the infection has changed. Half of all new infections now occur among youth and substantial disparities exist based on sexual orientation. Recent data from the National HIV/AIDS Reporting System indicate that male-to-male sexual contact accounts for 76-79% of HIV diagnoses among 16-19 year old males, although less is known about the actual prevalence of HIV and related health issues in this population. Disparities also exist in preparedness to prevent HIV among young men who have sex with men (YMSM), with no proven intervention for adolescents in this vulnerable group. The epidemic of HIV among YMSM does not exist in a vacuum. Instead, YMSM experience multiple psychosocial health disparities, including elevated rates of illicit drug use, exposure to violence, and mental health problems such as suicidality. Recent evidence indicates that these health issues represent intertwined epidemics that each contribute to HIV risk among YMSM, a situation referred to as a syndemic. Building on our own research with YMSM, as well as other high risk youth, we are proposing to investigate a syndemic of psychosocial health issues linked to HIV among YMSM ages 16-20. This syndemic includes HIV risk, drug use, internalizing mental health problems, and violence exposure. The overarching goals of this study are twofold: 1) to provide much-needed epidemiological data on the prevalence of HIV and related health issues in order to inform public health priorities; and 2) to collect vital information on risk and protective factors to inform the development of an intervention targeting this vulnerable population. We will accomplish these goals with three primary specific aims: (1) Ascertain the prevalence and clustering of a syndemic of biopsychosocial health problems among YMSM. We will: (a) Recruit a representative sample of 450 ethnically diverse YMSM using Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS); (b) Assess the syndemic components using state-of-the-art approaches; (c) Use the RDS model to calculate unbiased estimators of the prevalence of syndemic components; (d) Test for the clustering of syndemic components. (2) Characterize multiple trajectories of syndemic development by following our YMSM sample longitudinally over a two year period. We will: (a) Assess youth every 6 months during the transition from late adolescence to emerging adulthood, to explore the natural history of syndemic development. (b) Use growth-mixture modeling to characterize groups of youth with different trajectory classes of syndemic development in order to allow for early identification of youth most at risk of HIV acquisition. (3) Determine the importance of YMSM-specific factors in syndemic development so as to guide the development of culturally-relevant HIV prevention interventions for our target population. We will: (a) Test the value of YMSM-specific factors as predictors of trajectory class; (b) Test the incremental value of our theoretical syndemic model for predicting HIV-related sexual risk relative to the IMB model. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) are at elevated risk for a syndemic of biopsychosocial health problems. This syndemic includes HIV risk, substance use, internalizing mental health problems, and violence exposure.

"Development and Testing of a Syndemic Model among Gay and Bisexual Male Adolescen    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The training goal of this career development grant is to become an independent scientific investigator contributing to the understanding of the social processes through which gay and bisexual male adolescents and emerging adults (GBMAEA) develop a range of health disparities, including HIV/AIDS, depression, and substance use. These processes require investigation in order to inform the development of multilevel and structural interventions to eliminate these disparities. In order to achieve these goals, I propose to develop and apply skills in the areas of adolescent development, psychosocial scale development and validation, latent class analysis and mixed models. Dr. Gary Harper will oversee my professional development under this proposal. In addition to supervising my progress through the proposed research and training plan, Dr. Harper will supervise my training in two areas of skill development: qualitative data analysis methods and adolescent development theories and applications. Dr. Isa Fernandez will act as a co-mentor and senior methodologist working with me on secondary data analysis, sampling and recruitment methods and supervision of my grantsmanship and R01 proposal development. Dr. Richard Campbell will act as a co-mentor and supervise my training in statistical methods, including psychosocial scale validation, item response analysis, latent class analysis, and mixed models. Dr. Ron Stall will act as a co- mentor and supervise my training in developing and testing a model of syndemic production of HIV/AIDS and health disparities. The goal of the proposed research is to empirically test a model of syndemic production of negative health outcomes among GBMAEA, and to investigate possible resiliencies among this population that are associated with positive health outcomes. I will assess (a) how these male adolescents and emerging adults perceive, experience and internalize gay-related stigma, (b) how sexual identity development is correlated with the perception, experience, and internalization of gay-related stigma, (c) to what degree these stigma processes and sexual identity development are associated to a range of health risk indicators, and (d) to what degree perceived social support moderates the effects of stigma and sexual identity development on health behaviors. This application supports the mission of the National Institute of Mental Health by producing data on sexual identity development trajectories, gay-related stigma, and health behaviors of GBMAEA that will help inform the development of theoretically sound multi-level and structural interventions in the future to address HIV/AIDS and health disparities among this population.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the U.S., men who have sex with men are affected by marked health disparities, including elevated rates of HIV infection, substance use, and depression, that may be syndemically produced as responses to marginalization during adolescence.

"Understanding Female Partners of Bisexual Men: Implications for HIV/STD Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the United States, the reported rates of new HIV diagnoses among black and Hispanic women are, respectively, 20 and 5.4 times that of white women. A greater tendency toward bisexual behavior and non-gay identification among black and Hispanic men who have sex with men (MSM) than among white MSM is thought to contribute to the large racial/ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS observed among women; however, nearly nothing is known about the female partners of behaviorally bisexual men. Furthermore, many HIV-infected women are considered ""heterosexual unidentified risk"" because they do not fit into an HIV transmission category other than sex with a male of unidentified risk. We propose a two-phase study to better understand HIV risk among women of color by identifying predictors of sex with bisexual and unidentified risk men and exploring psychosocial issues surrounding and correlates of these sexual partnerships. This research will be carried out among African-American and Latina females recently tested for HIV in publicly funded test sites in Los Angeles County.       In Phase I, a matched case-control analysis will be carried out using secondary data to identify predictors of having had sex with a bisexual man or of being diagnosed HIV-antibody positive with unidentified heterosexual risk. In Phase II, recently tested women will be recruited and interviewed, including 30 who report bisexual male partners and 20 HIV-infected women with unidentified sexual risk. The in-depth semi-structured interview will examine psychosocial factors surrounding sexual relationships with men, including known bisexual, potentially bisexual, and presumed heterosexual men and explore (1) the range of relationship types characterizing women's relationships with these men; (2) attitudes regarding gender roles and desired partner traits; (3) how and when participants became aware of their partners' bisexual behavior and how this awareness influenced their HIV risk perception; (4) how HIV-antibody positive women with unidentified sexual risk perceive they and their partners were infected; and (5) participant's attitudes and behaviors regarding health-related research, health care, and STD/HIV prevention. Interview transcripts will be analyzed using a consensual qualitative research approach to identify major themes and generate hypotheses and survey items for a larger quantitative interview study comparing women reporting sex with a bisexual male to women who do not believe that they have had sex with a bisexual man. They will also help direct prevention resources and guide HIV prevention intervention approaches among women of color.          ",Understanding Female Partners of Bisexual Men: Implications for HIV/STD Risk ,7866497,SC3GM083780,"['Los Angeles ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Collaborations ', ' Anal Sex ', ' Oral Sex ', ' permissiveness ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' self esteem ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Social Desirability ', ' Social Desirabilities ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Awareness ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' resource guides ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Categories ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Case-Control Studies ', ' Case-Referrent Studies ', ' Case-Referent Studies ', ' Case-Compeer Studies ', ' Case-Comparison Studies ', ' Case-Base Studies ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' County ', ' risk perception ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Sampling ', ' case control ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Color ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' safer sex ', ' stem ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' Psychosocial Influences ', ' Psychosocial Issues ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' Conservatism ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Transcript ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' Female ', ' Affect ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Age ', ' Bisexual ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' sexual relationship ', ' ']",NIGMS,CHARLES R.

"An HIV Intervention Tailored for Black YMSM in the House Ball Community    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent HIV surveillance data show that men who have sex with men (MSM) are the only risk group in which the number of new infections rose annually from 2001-2006 (Hall et al., 2008). Among persons aged 13-24, Blacks are disproportionately affected by HIV infection accounting for 55% of all HIV infections reported (CDC, 2005). These racial disparities among MSM persist in the Chicago area, with the HIV prevalence rate among Black MSM (30.1%) more than twice that of White (11.3%) and Hispanic MSM (12.0%) (Chicago Department of Public Health, 2009). The racial disparity in HIV prevalence rate is even more striking among youth ages 18-24, with 24.2% among Black YMSM compared to 2.3% for White YMSM and 6.5% for Hispanic YMSM (CDPH, 2009). Despite the urgent need, there are no theoretically based, culturally appropriate behavioral interventions to reduce the risk of sexual acquisition or transmission of HIV among BYMSM.  Furthermore, there are no HIV prevention interventions specifically targeting the House Ball community, an understudied and clandestine subculture of the Black gay community with high HIV prevalence (Sanchez et al., 2009; Marks et al., 2008; Murill et al., 2005).   The d-up! Defend Yourself"" intervention, which has shown efficacy with BMSM (Jones et al., 2008), may be particularly well-suited for reaching BYMSM in the House Ball community. An adaptation of Kelly's Popular Opinion leader (POL) intervention ((Kelly et al., 1991,1992,1997,2006; Fernandez et al., 2003, 2005),  d-up! Defend Yourself! utilizes opinion leaders from within the community to change social norms and  perceptions of BMSM regarding safer sex practices (Jones et al., 2008). d-up! is delivered by members of the  targeted community, thus providing ""intravention"", an approach most appropriate for insulated and  marginalized communities such as the House Ball community (Bailey, 2009; Friedman et al., 2004).   In this application, we propose to tailor the d-up! intervention for relevance with the Chicago House Ball  community and then conduct a small, pilot trial to test for feasibility and acceptability. We will begin by  conducting a series of focus groups in order to identify persuasive, culturally-appropriate messages and  identify intervention targets. Based on focus group data, we will then tailor the intervention to be relevant for  the Chicago House Ball community. We will then use Kelly and colleagues (2004) procedures for identifying popular opinion leaders from within the community and inviting them to participate in the study. We will implement a baseline community risk assessment by obtaining a convenience sample of approximately 150 youth attending the School of Opulence over three consecutive weeks. Then, opinion leaders will be trained on the tailored intervention over a period of four weeks. We will conduct four equally spaced (3, 6, 9, 12 months post-baseline) cross-sectional follow-up assessments of convenience samples of youth (i.e. approximately 150 youth at each time point) from the House Ball community. The follow-up assessments will include measures of sexual risk behavior in the past 3 months and exposure to the intervention through opinion leaders and marketing materials over the past 3 months. Opinion leaders will be asked to rate the acceptability of the intervention and the feasibility of communicating risk reduction messages within their social networks.  Feasibility of the overall intervention will also be assessed by the number of opinion leaders recruited that  agreed to be trained, the number of risk reduction conversations documented by opinion leaders, and retention  of the opinion leaders over the project period.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: For this application, we will examine the feasibility and acceptability of a popular opinion leader intervention for use with Black, young men who have sex with men that participate in the House Ball community in Chicago. The aim of such an intervention is to decrease HIV infections in a community already disproportionately impacted by HIV. This intervention has great potential to directly impact the lives of young men who have sex with men in the House Ball community and to decrease HIV transmission to sexual partners inside and outside of the community.             PROJECT NARRATIVE  For this application, we will examine the feasibility and acceptability of a popular opinion leader  intervention for use with Black, young men who have sex with men that participate in the House  Ball community in Chicago.

"HIV Risk Behavior of Adult Minority Heterosexual Men in New York City The proposed study will focus on an essential but neglected area of HIV prevention research: sexual behavior and determinants of HIV risk among HIV seropositive adult African American and Latino men who have sex with women (MSW) in urban settings. Heterosexual transmission of HIV has steadily increased in recent years and now accounts for over one-third of all new HIV/AIDS diagnoses in the U.S.—and 80% among women. Minority women are especially vulnerable to sexually acquired HIV. Social and cultural norms that reinforce gender inequalities often prevent minority women from enacting safe sex practices with male partners. This has led researchers to focus on women's sexual risk behavior and the development of HIV prevention programs targeted to women, often to the exclusion of men. However, male condom use remains under the control of men, and culturally sanctioned social norms afford men greater power with respect to sexual behavior and decision-making. Despite the central role played by HIV positive adult minority men in the heterosexual transmission of HIV, little is known about their sexual practices, and the psychosocial, contextual, and cultural factors underlying men’s risk behavior. The proposed 2-year study will help fill this gap using a mixed methods design involving 324 HIV positive adult MSW recruited from primary care settings in Harlem and South Bronx in New York City. This research will be guided by an integrated conceptual framework of MSW sexual risk behavior, synthesized from current health behavior theory and refined through qualitative interviews. A structured quantitative questionnaire will be administered to participants using audio computer assisted self-interview (ACASI) techniques. The questionnaire will include items documenting the range, variation, patterns, and networks of adult men’s heterosexual behavior, and related determinants. Structural equation modeling will be used to specify and validate an empirical model of HIV positive men’s sexual risk that will inform HIV prevention efforts targeting secondary heterosexual transmission of HIV to women in high prevalence communities.  Public Health Relevance Statement: Heterosexual transmission of HIV has steadily increased in recent years and now accounts for over one-third of all new HIV/AIDS diagnoses in the U.S. Heterosexual and bisexual adult minority men play a major role in the sexual transmission of HIV. Presently, there are serious gaps in our knowledge of African American and Latino men's sexual behaviors that facilitate the transmission of HIV to women. Attainment of such knowledge can suggest ways to increase men's active participation in preventing the spread of HIV infection.",HIV Risk Behavior of Adult Minority Heterosexual Men in New York City,7905756,R01HD057793,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Male Condoms ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Gender Role ', ' Health behavior ', ' Homologous Serum Hepatitis Virus ', ' HBV ', ' Hepatitis B Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Infection ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' New York City ', ' Play ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Area ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' HCV ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' psychosocial ', ' Equation ', ' AIDS/HIV diagnosis ', ' safer sexual behavior ', ' safer sex ', ' Responsible sexual behavior ', ' Responsible Sex ', ' Protected Sex ', ' Safe Sex ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention program ', ' Exclusion ', ' social inequality ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' High Prevalence ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' trend ', ' To specify ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' women of childbearing age ', ' women of child bearing age ', ' Female of childbearing age ', ' Female of child bearing age ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' neglect ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' protective behavior ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' 5 year old ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' surveillance data ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2010,500020,0.0802106939647099
"Syndemic Production among Emergent Adult Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent trends in U.S. urban centers indicate a rise in the number of new HIV infections in the population of young men who have sex with men (YMSM). These trends suggest a high level of vulnerability to HIV seroconversion in YMSM through sexual behavior as they emerge into adulthood. In addition, acts of sexual risk taking in this population often function synergistically with illicit drug use, and mental health burden. Despite some success with HIV prevention in the MSM population during the last 25 years, these recent patterns suggest that a reexamination of our prevention strategies for this population, especially for YMSM of color, is needed. Given the interplay that exists between unprotected sexual behavior, illicit drug use, and mental health burden, all such efforts must consider how these overlapping epidemics (also known as syndemics) fuel each other in a cohort of YMSM as they emerge into adulthood. Thus, we will we will initiate a prospective longitudinal program of research to follow the development of syndemics in a racially/ethnically and economically diverse cohort of urban HIV-negative YMSM in New York City as they transition from adolescence into young adulthood, and apply, test, and further develop a theory of syndemic production to understand the development of both maladaptive and adaptive behavioral outcomes. Specifically we seek to (1) develop and test theoretically informed measurement models of the covariance of illicit drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and mental health burden among emergent adult HIV-negative YMSM within and across time, (2) assess whether patterns of behavior are continuous, discontinuous, or some combination of both; (3) delineate the risk and protective bases-physical factors (i.e., pubertal onset, HIV status), relational factors (i.e., family history of psychopathology, current romantic relationships, peer support, and characteristics of residential, social, and sex neighborhoods), and psychosocial factors (i.e., sexual identity, internalized homophobia, hypermasculinity, racial identity, racial devaluation, HIV optimism) that predict the development of syndemics, and (4) determine the extent to which the development of syndemics varies by race/ethnicity, social class, and homelessness/housing stability in a cohort of HIV-negative YMSM. Using multiple measurement modalities, which include biological assays, calendar based methods, and self-reports, we will follow the development of 675, 18-year-old HIV-negative YMSM. Participants will be recruited through venue-based and respondent driven sampling, as they emerge into adulthood, over seven waves of data collection within a 36-month time frame. We will utilize Structural Equation and Latent Growth Curve Analysis to answer our four main research questions.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to understand why a new generation of young men who have sex with other men place themselves at risk for HIV transmission. Knowledge which we will generate will help us understand how these young men emerge into adulthood, the choices they make about sexual behavior and illicit drug use, as well as how these two behaviors interact with their mental health. We seek to understand why some men exhibit risky behaviors as they emerge into adulthood while others do not. Working with community and municipal partners, we will draw from what we have learned from both groups to develop strategies for HIV prevention and intervention that are relevant to this current and developing generation who did not live through the devastation of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980's. In addition, we will add to the methodological literature based on our analysis of nested latent growth curve models.

"Reducing HIV Disparities: Sexual Concurrency Communication for HIV Prevention amo    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on different racial/ethnic groups remains one of the most extreme examples of a racial disparity in health among Americans. HIV infection is significantly higher among non-Hispanic blacks than among any other racial/ethnic group in the United States. There is now evidence that sexual network dynamics, including overlapping sexual partnerships (concurrency) play an important role in racial disparities in HIV. Due to structural factors, including highly disproportionate incarceration rates, African- Americans are more likely to be in sexual networks where people have more concurrent sexual partners. Mathematical models show that achieving very small reductions in levels of sexual concurrency can have a dramatic impact on the chain of HIV transmission. Our Community Action Board (CAB) of the Center for AIDS & STD Working Group on Disparities has prioritized developing health communication messages about sexual networks to help reduce HIV stigma and transmission in communities of African heritage. In this research, we will utilize community-based participatory research methods to translate the science of sexual networks into culturally-resonant HIV prevention messages as a new approach to help reduce racial disparities in HIV. Aim 1: Undertake formative research to develop HIV prevention messages that convey the importance of sexual network dynamics in King County, Washington. The CAB Disparities Working Group will conduct focus groups and interviews with a) native-born African-Americans and b) foreign-born blacks (Ethiopian and Kenyan immigrants, who are the majority of incident HIV among foreign-born blacks in King County). We will develop a multimedia tool in English, Kiswahili, and Amharic illustrating principles of HIV transmission in sexual networks for use in community discussions. We will identify sexual network message dissemination channels in the target populations including social network approaches (person-to-person communication), civil society approaches (faith-based organizations, community events and organizations), and the media. Subaim 2.1.1. We will continue to inform ourselves about best practices in community-participatory research via seminars and discussions. Aim 2: Pilot and evaluate the impact of the HIV prevention concurrency messages among populations of African-Americans and African-born populations in King County. The CAB Disparities Working Group will launch HIV prevention concurrency messaging and evaluate acceptability and impact, including message comprehension and recall (1-month post recall among n=30 African-Americans and n=30 Kenyans and Ethiopians), intention, and attitude strength. The CAB Working Group will develop and implement a manual of community-based research translation processes used including community outreach, HIV prevention message development, and message dissemination in affected communities. Subaim  2.2.1. We will build capacity by educating ourselves about cutting edge approaches to development and marketing of health messages. Aim 3: HIV disparity message findings and tools will be shared in a national seminar. We will invite the national Center for AIDS Research network and their CABs to a national meeting, where we will also explore the feasibility of a community-collaborative multi-site randomized controlled trial assessing impact of a sexual concurrency intervention for HIV prevention in areas with large populations of African- Americans and African immigrants. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study addresses the critical and persistent disparity in HIV among persons of African heritage. A novel sexual network approach that translates new scientific understanding into culturally-resonant prevention messages delivered within a community-participatory framework has the potential to be implemented for other similar populations across the US.

"Reducing Sexual Risk Behaviors among Rural African-American Cocaine Users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV and other sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates continue to rise disproportionately among African-Americans, and particularly dramatically among rural populations. Stimulant use, especially cocaine use, among rural African-Americans is also increasing, and is related to multiple risk behaviors for HIV/STI, including sex with multiple partners, exchanging sex for drugs and other commodities, and inconsistent condom use. Despite these documented risk patterns, and the increasing disparities in HIV/STI incidence, few theory-based interventions have been specifically designed and tested for rural African-American populations with high-risk behavioral patterns. The primary aims of this project are to adapt an existing risk reduction program to the needs of rural African-American cocaine users, to test the adapted intervention's efficacy via a behavioral clinical trial, and to answer outstanding questions regarding intraclass correlation and sampling methodologies in the sexual risk reduction literature. The project team will conduct a longitudinal intervention study with stratified group randomization, so that participants receive the sexual risk intervention or an active control intervention condition in groups. Each intervention condition is equivalent in terms of contact time and in terms of number and type of contacts (each participant receives two group sessions, two individual sessions, two community-building sessions, and two follow-up ""booster"" sessions over four months). Respondent-driven sampling will be used to recruit and enroll 280 participants across two rural, predominantly African-American counties in the Arkansas Delta region to one of the two intervention conditions. The primary outcome variables will include condom use skills, sexual negotiation skills, and self-reported risk behaviors. Additional measures, including self-efficacy for decreased sexual risk, perceived peer norms for sexual risk, perceived benefits and barriers of sexual risk reduction, social support and social trust, mental health status, partner violence, and substance use, will also be collected to assess their theory-based mediating and moderating influences on the sexual risk skills and behaviors. Assessments will be conducted prior to the intervention, immediately post-intervention, and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. This project brings together a strong, experienced investigative team which has an established, trusting relationship with the community that will be involved in the study.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The project not only will provide critically-needed information about the efficacy of tailored behavioral interventions among rural African-Americans at high risk for HIV/STIs, but also will allow the study team to investigate important methodological questions about the use of respondent- driven sampling approaches in rural settings and about intraclass correlation coefficients for sexual risk measures in tight-knit rural communities. This research can thus make important contributions that address racial disparities in HIV/STIs, provide approaches for slowing the rapid growth of the epidemics in rural areas, and inform methodological innovations of importance to sexual risk reduction science.          ",Reducing Sexual Risk Behaviors among Rural African-American Cocaine Users,8123210,R01DA024575,"['cocaine use ',

"Relationship Disruption during Incarceration and HIV Risk in African American Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men released from prison face disproportionate HIV risk. Preventing HIV sexual risk behavior and drug use in this group is critical to reducing the race disparity in HIV. However, research on the factors that drive and protect against HIV risk among African American male releasees is limited. Returning to a committed partner after release may be an important protective factor against HIV risk among African American male releasees during reentry. However, incarceration destabilizes committed relationships. Though 50-80% of men enter prison in a committed relationship, we estimate that half of these relationships end by the time of release. Upon release, loss of a partner may lead men to seek multiple, new partners to meet companionship needs or may lead to distress and, in turn, self-medication with drugs or sex. No prior study has evaluated the degree to which partner loss during incarceration influences post-release HIV risk. The present mixed method study is designed to address this gap in the current field of HIV prevention science. This study seeks to examine the hypothesis that dissolution of stable intimate relationships during incarceration elevates sexual risk behavior and drug use among inmates upon their release. The specific aims are: Primary Quantitative Aims: Aim 1. Among African American men in relationships at the time of prison entry, to describe the associations between dissolution of relationships during incarceration and HIV sexual risk behavior (unprotected sex; multiple sex partnerships; buying sex for money or drugs) and drug use (crack use; binge drinking). Aim 2. To assess whether diminished mental health (low coping; increased depression; increased anxiety) due to dissolution of relationships during incarceration results in HIV sexual risk behavior and drug use. Aim 3. To evaluate whether the association between dissolution of relationships during incarceration and HIV sexual risk behavior and drug use varies by respondent and relationship characteristics. Qualitative Aim: To qualitatively explore the social context of post-release and men's perceptions of the factors and processes driving post-release sexual risk behavior and drug use. To accomplish these study aims, we propose to recruit 400 African American male inmates who are scheduled to be released from prison and who were in stable intimate heterosexual relationships at the time of prison entry. Our pilot work suggests that ~50% of relationships will have ended during the incarceration. We will follow men after their release to assess whether post-release sexual risk behavior and drug use are higher among men whose relationships ended during incarceration versus men whose relationships remained intact. The proposed study is designed to inform development of policies and interventions that minimize the destabilizing effects of criminal justice involvement on relationships and health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Since more than 800,000 African American men are incarcerated in prison at any given time, and hundreds of thousands return home to their communities each year, policies and programs that are effective in reducing HIV risk in this group would prevent substantial numbers of new infections among African American men and members of their sexual networks annually. This research will determine whether dissolution of committed relationships during incarceration is a risk factor for post-release HIV sexual risk behavior and drug use among African American male releasees and will describe the pathways through which relationship dissolution may work to influence HIV risk. Study findings may highlight the need for implementation of criminal justice policies that reduce network disruption and may inform HIV prevention interventions, including in-prison programs for inmates and their partners that foster communication and prevent relationship dissolution, and pre-release HIV prevention education for men who have lost a committed partner during incarceration.

"Eating Disorders and Adolescent Body Image Among Boys and Sexual Minorities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To date, most research on eating disorders has focused on girls and women. However, with youth overweight and obesity rates reaching epidemic proportions, pressure to be thin and lean has likely contributed to an increased risk for all youth to engage in disordered dieting and exercise behaviors. Such behaviors not only increase the risk for developing eating disorders, but may also contribute to future weight gain and the development of comorbid psychopathology (e.g., depression). Inadequate focus, however, has been devoted to the experiences of men and of sexual minorities (gay/lesbian, bisexual), in spite of emerging evidence that their body image socialization processes may differ from those of heterosexual women, and that gender expression and sexual orientation may impact cognitive and behavioral reactions to negative body image. Such findings necessitate future studies focused on the processes that underlie gender and sexual orientation differences in disturbed dieting and exercise. To address these research imperatives, the program of research will focus on the following aims: (1) Utilize multi-wave longitudinal data on physical development, body image socialization, and dieting and exercise behaviors to elucidate the development of heterosexual and sexual minority boys and girls' body image socialization and disordered dieting and exercise behaviors. Analyses will examine the diversity in pathways to disordered dieting and exercise, and investigate how gender, sexual orientation, and the interactions between the two are linked to such developmental variability. (2) Elucidate factors that contribute to the development of boys' negative body image socialization and disordered dieting and exercise behaviors. In particular, the research will focus on pubertal development, gender expression (i.e., gender conformity), and the development of the muscularity ideal. (3) Identify unique and shared longitudinal predictors of eating disorder risk among the sexual minority subgroups, paying particular attention to gender, gender expression, level of identity disclosure (i.e., outness), identity-related distress, and sexual minority community involvement. Findings will help clarify how sexual orientation serves as both a risk and protective factor for disordered dieting and exercise behaviors. To fulfill these aims the research will utilize national data from the Growing Up Today Study, a nine-wave longitudinal cohort study begun in 1996 of over 16,000 youth who were recruited when they were between the ages of 9-14 and who are now in their mid 20s. A combination of longitudinal statistical methods (e.g., growth mixture modeling) will be used to examine diversity in the development of disordered dieting and exercise. The proposed research will be among the first to examine the confluence of physical development, body image socialization, and the emergence of disordered dieting and exercise among males and females of all sexual orientations. Findings will clarify key mechanisms of health risk and promotion as well as inform interventions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Eating disorders represent a tremendous cost to society, affecting productivity, physical health, social relationships, and well being. New research regarding gender and sexual orientation differences in the manifestation and prevalence of disturbed dieting and exercise suggest that boys and sexual minorities are understudied and underserved populations. Studying the unique risk and protective factors that create differential risk for boys and sexual minority subgroups has the potential to inform dieting and exercise disorder interventions for all youth.           7. Project Narrative/Relevance Eating disorders represent a tremendous cost to society, affecting productivity, physical health, social relationships, and well being.

"Web-Based Intervention for Black Bisexually-Active Men    Description (provided by the applicant): African Americans are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS, and this disparity is further evident among bisexually-active African American men (BAAM).Yet, there is insufficient knowledge regarding sexual risk behaviors of BAAM and the context in which they occur. To date, no interventions in the literature with demonstrated efficacy in reducing HIV-related sexual risk behaviors have been developed and evaluated for BAAM who do not inject drugs. The proposed study will develop and test the efficacy and acceptability of an innovative individually-tailored and culturally-sensitive 6-session online-delivered video intervention that simultaneously targets multiple domains of socio-cultural, structural-level factors, and contextual factors related to HIV risk behavior among BAAM, relative to an attention control (education) condition. This intervention is theoretically informed both in content (using the Information-Motivation-Behavior Skills model) and delivery (using tenets of Social Cognitive theory) and will feature peer BAAM. Both behavioral and biologic outcomes will be measured. Using respondent-driven sampling, a total of 120 BAAM will be enrolled and randomly assigned to either treatment or education-control conditions. They will be longitudinally tracked for six months (assessed at Baseline, month 3, and month 6). In addition to determining the prevalence of lifetime and recent HIV-associated risk behavior among BAAM,   this study seeks to evaluate the impact of a brief intervention across three domains over time: (1)   intentions/motivations to reduce HIV-associated risk behavior, (2) self-reported HIV-associated risk behavior, and (3) health/prevention knowledge and self-efficacy skills. The long term goal of the proposed project is to develop an empirically validated HIV/STI prevention program that can be delivered online BAAM. Consistent with the R34 mechanism, the final product will be the basis for   an R01 application to conduct a large-scale efficacy study in this population. Should this intervention   demonstrate effective, it will be a cost feasible approach to preventing HIV transmissions among BAAM, delivered via the medium where many men who have sex with men (including BAAM) actively meet sex partners (i.e., the Internet). Finally, the model for this intervention can easily be adopted by HIV service providers and delivered outside of traditional clinical setting with a variety of populations.            7. Project Narrative The findings of this study will facilitate a more nuanced understanding of HIV-associated risk behaviors of bisexually-active African American men (BAAM) and the context in which they occur, which will, in turn, inform prevention and intervention efforts. Specifically, the findings will inform HIV prevention, interventions, and treatments designed to reduce HIV associated risk behaviors. And should the intervention demonstrate effective, it will be a cost feasible approach to preventing HIV transmissions that can easily be adopted by HIV service providers and delivered outside of traditional clinical setting with a variety of high-risk populations.",Web-Based Intervention for Black Bisexually-Active Men,8080367,R34MH086333,"['Prevention program ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Motivation ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Perception ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Female ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Population ', ' Behavior ', ' Testing ', ' Evaluation ', ' Accounting ', ' cost ', ' Diagnosis ', ' meetings ', ' Pattern ', ' Health ', ' Sampling ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Control Groups ', ' Knowledge ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Literature ', ' Adopted ', ' intervention program ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Prevention ', ' Grant ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Affect ', ' male ', ' Communities ', ' Oral ', ' Participant ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Clinical ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Provider ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Respondent ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Individual ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Incidence ', ' Prevalence ', ' skills ', ' Comprehension ', ' experience ', ' Attention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Outcome ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Time ', ' Behavioral ', ' base ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Process ', ' Modeling ', ' Reporting ', ' Address ', ' peer ', ' high risk ', ' Area ', ' Risk ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Woman ', ' Services ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Research ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Goals ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Feedback ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' brief intervention ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Bisexual ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' sexually active ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' Infection prevention ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Behavior Control ', ' behavioral control ', ' Behavioral Manipulation ', ' condoms ', ' ']",NIMH,HUNTER COLLEGE,R34,2011,213365,0.03771737742658544
"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Fall Risk and Bone Strength Among Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The changing shape of the U.S. population age structure will dramatically increase the number of osteoporotic fractures in the elderly; the increase will disproportionately affect minorities and men. It is therefore important to understand the epidemiology of osteoporosis in these populations. While there are clear racial/ethnic differences in fracture rates, their origins are not understood. The proposed study will be a comprehensive effort to further our understanding of the fundamental causes of racial/ethnic disparities in fracture rates by focusing on markers of two primary `upstream' determinants of fracture: falls and bone fragility. The Boston Area Community Health/Bone (BACH/Bone) Survey is a study of skeletal health in a randomly selected group of 1,219 black, Hispanic, and white men between 29-80 y. BACH/Bone staff have been very productive, producing over 10 papers for peer-reviewed journals. We propose a second wave of data collection on ~825 men to begin ~6.5 y after baseline, when the cohort will be between 35-86 y. The Specific Aims of the proposed study are to, in a racially/ethnically diverse, population-based sample of men: 1) Estimate longitudinal changes in markers of bone strength and fall risk, with and without adjustment for known risk factors; 2) Determine the relative contributions of social factors, individual risk behaviors and health status, and physiological influences to racial/ethnic differences in markers of fall risk and bone strength; 3) Establish the first age- and racial/ethnic group-specific, population-based estimates of bone microarchitecture, and identify determinants of observed age and racial/ethnic differences; 4) Determine whether there are age and racial/ethnic differences in the ratio of bone loads to bone strength (the `factor of risk'); 5) Examine whether genetic ancestry contributes to variations in markers of fall risk and bone strength beyond that attributable to self-identified race/ethnicity. The representativeness and racial/ethnic diversity of the BACH/Bone cohort are unique, and, as such, the potential impact of the study is enormous. By focusing upstream on markers of fall risk and bone strength with state-of-the-art measures, it will make landmark contributions to our understanding of the elusive mechanisms underlying racial/ethnic differences in bone fragility. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Boston Area Community Health/Bone Survey is an observational research study examining the complex relationships between aging, social structure, health and lifestyle, hormones, genetic factors, and markers of fall risk as well as bone strength in a population-based sample of racially/ethnically diverse aging men.

"Gender Identity and HIV Risk II    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a revised submission for a 5-year competitive continuation to grant 1R01-DA015269, Gender Identity and HIV Risk. The long-range goal of our research is to reduce HIV transmission among individuals stigmatized for their gender nonconformity and diversity, a goal consistent with the Healthy People 2010 objective to reduce the nation's health disparities. Key findings from our prior work were: a) a national sample of these individuals can be effectively reached via the Internet; b) differences in sex, gender identity/role, and sexual orientation are associated with important differences in HIV risk behavior; c) individuals in the female role are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection through the high risk behavior of the men with whom they interact. We propose to build on these findings by investigating the HIV risk behavior and cofactors of this population's high risk male partners (N=400), using online survey and interview methods successfully applied in the original project (Aim 1). These results will help inform the development of a theory- driven, Internet-based, HIV prevention intervention for individuals who are stigmatized for their gender non- conformity (Aim 2). The intervention will be modeled on an offline HIV intervention shown, in an uncontrolled trial, to reduce risk behavior in the target population. After user-testing and refinement of the prototype online intervention, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial (N=600) to evaluate its efficacy in improving health and reducing HIV risk behavior (Aim 3). This study is innovative in that a) few interventions exist for this minority population and even fewer have been adequately evaluated; b) the intervention will combine HIV prevention and behavior change theories with principles of e-learning; c) the entire study will be implemented online. Our team is highly experienced in HIV prevention research with diverse and vulnerable populations, the benefits/challenges of Internet-based research (online recruitment, data collection, intervention adaptation), and sexual health theory and measures. The project has public health significance in that the minority population targeted for intervention is at high risk for HIV infection, and the men with whom they interact not only pose a risk to them, but also to the general population. If proven effective, the online intervention can be implemented with little additional cost to reduce gender-related HIV risks on a large scale, nationally and internationally, even among highly stigmatized groups.           ",Gender Identity and HIV Risk II,8063089,R01HD057595,"['Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' virtual ', ' peer ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Target Populations ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Rural ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Interview ', ' high risk ', ' Stigmata ', ' sex ', ' experience ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Computers ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Effectiveness ', ' male ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' base ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Affect ', ' Procedures ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Data Collection ', ' prototype ', ' Modeling ', ' improved ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' programs ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' interest ', ' Attitude ', ' success ', ' Learning ', ' Reporting ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Individual ', ' Knowledge ', ' Goals ', ' Work ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Time ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' instrument ', ' Health ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Control Groups ', ' theories ', ' Sampling ', ' Population ', ' cost ', ' satisfaction ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Woman ', ' United States ', ' Persons ', ' Area ', ' Risk ', ' Behavior ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Behavioral ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Participant ', ' Characteristics ', ' Evaluation ', ' Play ', ' Measures ', ' Grant ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Research ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' response ', ' Testing ', ' Methods ', ' Gender ', ' Companions ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' transgender ', ' transsexual ', ' high risk behavior ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' self esteem ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Silicones ', ' cofactor ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Prevention education ', ' Minority ', ' behavior change ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', "" Women's Role "", ' Female Roles ', ' Respondent ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Body Image ', ' body perception ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' condoms ', ' safer sex ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2011,620274,0.012674160682738618
"Social Contexts, Sexual Networks, and Racial-Ethnic Disparities in STDs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research component of this project explores how racial-ethnic segregation and inequality shape sexual networks and the spread of sexually transmitted disease (STD). Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health), I will explore how racial- ethnic segregation and inequality at the school- and neighborhood-levels influence the formation of sexual partnerships. Applying parameter estimates from the Add Health to simulated sexual networks, I will then assess how sexual networks and disease diffusion may progress differently in settings with varying population compositions and patterns of racial-ethnic inequality. Informed by structural sociological theory, this research takes an interdisciplinary approach and applies testable social science hypotheses to problems of infectious disease epidemiology. Through relationships with mentors and advisors, coursework, and participation in professional seminars, the training component of this project would allow me to expand my work on health disparities to include (i) greater attention to social contexts and networks as determinants of health, and (ii) new types of contagious health outcomes. There are three career development objectives for the proposed project: (i) obtain skills and expertise in infectious disease epidemiology and network analysis; (ii) conduct original research on racial-ethnic STD disparities in the U.S.; and (iii) prepare a major grant to support an independent research program in social networks, health disparities, and infectious disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are large racial-ethnic disparities in sexually transmitted diseases in the United States.

"SEX EFFECTS ON CHEMOKINE MEDIATED CNS AUTOIMMUNITY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in the most common inflamatory disease of the nervous system, manifested by attacks of muscle weakness and loss of coordination, visual disturbances, bladder dysfunction and cognitive impairment. In the United States, MS is ranked as the second leading cause of neurologic disability among young adults, most notably women of childbearing age. For decades, it has been known that women are more susceptible than men to MS but the reasons for this health disparity are unclear. There is also plenty of clinical and experimental evidence that pregnancy lessens MS symptoms. However, women after childbirth suffer a worsening in disease severity. Also, women commonly exhibit the relapsing-remitting form of MS and have fluctuations in disease severity with their menstrual cycle. All this information suggest that female sexual hormones are deeply involved in MS onset and progession and understanding this component of MS is essential for the design of novel therapeutic strategies. Our lab, has found that normal human brain and mouse spinal cord tissues exhibit ablumenal localization of the chemokine CXCL12 at their vasculature. However, specimens from patients with MS and mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) exhibit relocation of CXCL12 to the lumenal surfaces of vessels. This alteration in CXCL12 expression has been shown to impact on the egress immune cells localized in spaces around microvasculature, enhancing disease severity during EAE. In preliminary studies, we have determined that the naive female SJL mouse, which may be induced to develop relapsing-remitting EAE via active immunization, exhibits lumenal CXCL12 expression within the white matter microvasculature, while the naove male SJL mouse, which does not develop relapsing-remitting EAE, exhibits ablumenal CXCL12 within all spinal cord regions. Microarray and corroborating quantitative PCR analysis comparing gray (cortical) and white (cerebellar) matter tissues from naove 10 week-old male and female SJL mice detected significantly 2-fold increased expression of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 2 (S1PR2), also known as Edg-5, in the cerebella of female SJL mice compared with male SJL cerebella and with both male and female SJL cortices. S1PR2 is a member of a G protein-coupled receptor family of endothelial differentiation genes with 8 members. Agonists of S1P receptors have previously been shown to be effective targets for the treatment of EAE and MS, predominantly through immunosuppressive mechanisms. FTY720, an agonist of S1P receptors, is known to cause retention of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissue via the specific activation of S1PR1/Edg-3, inducing lymphopenia in vivo. Furthermore, suppression of S1PR1 signaling by FTY720 has negative effect on CXCR4-mediated lymph node egress. Our preliminary data, however, suggests that an alternative receptor, S1PR2, might be a more specific target for manipulation of BBB biology during brain and spinal cord autoimmunity. In addition, our data reveals that white matter expression of this receptor exhibits sexual dimorphism, which suggests that it might be relevant for the development of relapsing-remitting MS. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that sexually dimorphic expression of S1PR2/Edg-5 impacts on the polarity of CXCL12 expression at the BBB through effects on adherent junction integrity, which, in turn, impacts on sexually dimorphic patterns of disease expression during EAE.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in the most common inflamatory disease of the brain and the second leading cause of neurologic disability among young adults, most notably women of childbearing age.

However, many scientist in the field recognize the involvement of female sexual hormones in the initiation and progression of MS and understanding this component is essential for the design of novel therapeutic strategies.

"Health Disparities Among a Vulnerable Population:  A Longitudinal Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research project will investigate sexual minority health disparities during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood. The Healthy People 2010 (NCHS 2000) initiative identifies sexual minorities as a key population of interest regarding health disparities, and an emerging field of research is beginning to document these inequalities. These health disparities include many ""key national indicators of well-being"" identified by NICHD (2008). The existing research on sexual minorities, however, has several limitations: 1) it is largely based on clinical and community samples; 2) it relies on cross sectional data sets; 3) it is often limited to one dichotomous indicator of sexual orientation; 4) it often ignores environmental influences, and 5) it has examined only a small number of health related outcomes. Given these limitations, this research is poised to make important contributions to the existing literature as well as public policy but improving upon the existing data, methods, and frameworks utilized. Specifically, this research will utilize nationally representative, longitudinal data and several indicators of same-sex orientation to investigate a wide variety of health outcomes including suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, self-reported health, self-reported morbidities, and a series of biomarkers designed to measure anthropometric, cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammation functioning. In addition to using these cutting-edge data, we will employ a series of innovative statistical techniques including generalized linear models, propensity score matching, multi-level models, and latent curve models. Critically, this work will employ an interdisciplinary, ""ecosocial"" framework that stresses the synergistic impact of individual, environmental, and biological level processes on health. Preliminary analyses conducted by the authors provide compelling evidence that the timing and patterns of sexual minority status identification are important pathways through which health outcomes are shaped. This research will build upon these preliminary findings and directly address the criticisms of previous work from an interdisciplinary framework that incorporates social, psychological, and biological processes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposal specifically addresses a target population and goals identified by the Healthy People 2010 initiative (NCHS 2000) and will document previously unexplored longitudinal trends in sexual minority health from an ""ecosocial"" framework. The study of sexual minority status and health provides a unique opportunity to examine disparities among a vulnerable population distributed across all race/ethnic and socioeconomic groups, allowing us to examine health trajectories in a variety of contexts. This research will generate important findings for public health policy by identifying both positive and negative pathways through which the relationship between sexual minority status and health are mediated.            Relevance To Public Health: This proposal specifically addresses a target population and goals identified by the Healthy People 2010 initiative (NCHS 2000) and will document previously unexplored longitudinal trends in sexual minority health from an ""ecosocial"" framework.

"Tobacco Use and Cardiovascular Disease in Sexual Minority Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use, in particular cigarette smoking, is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States.1 In addition to lung cancer and respiratory illness, tobacco use is responsible for increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and is a primary causal factor for two specific types of CVD: coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke.1,2 More than eighty-one million persons in the United States have at least one form of CVD, and CHD and stroke rank as the first and third leading causes of death, respectively.3,4 Recent research indicates lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals have the highest rates of tobacco use.9,10 Within this group, sexual minority men (i.e., men who identify as gay, bisexual, or who engage in same sex sexual behavior) have one of the largest smoking disparities, with a smoking rate of more than twice that of their heterosexual counterparts.9 Yet, we know almost nothing about tobacco use in sexual minority men or the extent to which tobacco use may be responsible for increased CVD in this population. Accordingly, the proposed study will utilize both nationally representative and clinic-based data to examine the relationship between the prevalence and patterns of tobacco use among sexual minority men and potential disparities in CVD. In addition the proposed project will also investigate the role of HIV infection as a potential effect measure modifier in the relationship between tobacco use and CVD. These objectives are consistent with the goals of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and relate to NIDA's strategic plan to foster research on health conditions that may inform, influence or interact with drug abuse and addiction, to decrease health disparities related to drug addiction and its consequences, and to decrease the health disparities associated with HIV/AIDS. With access to the resources of Saint Louis University and the Fenway Center for Population Research in LGBT Health, a well-crafted and carefully designed research training plan, and the support of an excellent mentoring team, the applicant is ideally suited to carry out the proposed research. The multi- disciplinary mentoring team brings expertise in the areas of epidemiologic outcomes research, psychiatric epidemiology, LGBT population research, cardiology, and biostatistics, and is fully committed to supporting the applicant throughout the training period. The long term goal of the applicant is to obtain a faculty position and develop an independent research career in the areas of chronic disease epidemiology and LGBT population health, and as such, the proposed research will play a key role in developing the applicant's potential for a promising research career.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will enhance our understanding of disparities in tobacco use among sexual minority men and the potential contribution of these disparities to increased cardiovascular disease among this population. This information is necessary to identify and address potential disparities in cardiovascular disease for sexual minority men, and may ultimately lead to a reduction in cardiovascular disease and death.                 This project will enhance our understanding of disparities in tobacco use among sexual minority men and the potential contribution of these disparities to increased cardiovascular disease among this population.

"Sexual Orientation and Obesity:  Test of a Gendered Biopsychosocial Model    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant: Sexual Orientation and Obesity: Test of a Gendered Biopsychosocial Model Obesity is one of the most critical public health issues affecting the U.S. today. Racial and socioeconomic disparities in the determinants, distribution, and consequences of obesity are receiving increasing attention; however, one area that is only beginning to be recognized is the striking interplay of gender and sexual orientation in obesity disparities. It is now well-established that women of minority sexual orientation are disproportionately affected by the obesity epidemic, with nearly three-quarters of adult lesbians overweight or obese, compared to half of heterosexual women. In stark contrast, among men, heterosexual males have nearly double the risk of obesity compared to gay males. Despite clear evidence from descriptive epidemiologic research that sexual orientation and gender markedly pattern obesity disparities, there is almost no prospective, analytic epidemiologic research into the causes of these disparities. It will be impossible to develop evidence-based preventive interventions unless we first answer basic questions about causal pathways, as we plan to do. Our study has high potential for public health impact not only for sexual minorities but also for heterosexuals, as we seek to uncover how processes of gender socialization may exacerbate obesity risk in both sexual minority females and heterosexual males. In response to PA-07-409 ""Health Research with Diverse Populations,"" we will rigorously test our innovative gendered biopsychosocial model that is both multilevel and multisystem to explain observed sexual orientation disparities in obesity. We will use longitudinal, repeated measures survey data and also biological data from three youth cohorts: Growing Up Today Study (GUTS) 1 & 2 and National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), all ongoing prospective cohorts that together total over 47,000 youth living throughout the United States.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity is one of the most critical public health issues affecting the U.S. today.

"Syndemic Production among Emergent Adult Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent trends in U.S. urban centers indicate a rise in the number of new HIV infections in the population of young men who have sex with men (YMSM). These trends suggest a high level of vulnerability to HIV seroconversion in YMSM through sexual behavior as they emerge into adulthood. In addition, acts of sexual risk taking in this population often function synergistically with illicit drug use, and mental health burden. Despite some success with HIV prevention in the MSM population during the last 25 years, these recent patterns suggest that a reexamination of our prevention strategies for this population, especially for YMSM of color, is needed. Given the interplay that exists between unprotected sexual behavior, illicit drug use, and mental health burden, all such efforts must consider how these overlapping epidemics (also known as syndemics) fuel each other in a cohort of YMSM as they emerge into adulthood. Thus, we will we will initiate a prospective longitudinal program of research to follow the development of syndemics in a racially/ethnically and economically diverse cohort of urban HIV-negative YMSM in New York City as they transition from adolescence into young adulthood, and apply, test, and further develop a theory of syndemic production to understand the development of both maladaptive and adaptive behavioral outcomes. Specifically we seek to (1) develop and test theoretically informed measurement models of the covariance of illicit drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and mental health burden among emergent adult HIV-negative YMSM within and across time, (2) assess whether patterns of behavior are continuous, discontinuous, or some combination of both; (3) delineate the risk and protective bases-physical factors (i.e., pubertal onset, HIV status), relational factors (i.e., family history of psychopathology, current romantic relationships, peer support, and characteristics of residential, social, and sex neighborhoods), and psychosocial factors (i.e., sexual identity, internalized homophobia, hypermasculinity, racial identity, racial devaluation, HIV optimism) that predict the development of syndemics, and (4) determine the extent to which the development of syndemics varies by race/ethnicity, social class, and homelessness/housing stability in a cohort of HIV-negative YMSM. Using multiple measurement modalities, which include biological assays, calendar based methods, and self-reports, we will follow the development of 675, 18-year-old HIV-negative YMSM. Participants will be recruited through venue-based and respondent driven sampling, as they emerge into adulthood, over seven waves of data collection within a 36-month time frame. We will utilize Structural Equation and Latent Growth Curve Analysis to answer our four main research questions.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to understand why a new generation of young men who have sex with other men place themselves at risk for HIV transmission. Knowledge which we will generate will help us understand how these young men emerge into adulthood, the choices they make about sexual behavior and illicit drug use, as well as how these two behaviors interact with their mental health. We seek to understand why some men exhibit risky behaviors as they emerge into adulthood while others do not. Working with community and municipal partners, we will draw from what we have learned from both groups to develop strategies for HIV prevention and intervention that are relevant to this current and developing generation who did not live through the devastation of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980's. In addition, we will add to the methodological literature based on our analysis of nested latent growth curve models.

"Male Incarceration, the Health Care Service Environment and Sexual Health Project Summary/Abstract Compared to areas with low rates of incarceration, areas with higher rates of incarceration have higher and increasing rates of sexually transmitted infections (hereafter STIs).[1,2] One study also found a statistically significant association between rates of male incarceration and rates of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).[1] Few studies have examined these relationships and even fewer studies have been conducted to explore the reasons for these higher rates.  This proposed mixed-method study will use the Social Cognitive Theory and the Social Ecological Model to fill this critical gap. The following three research aims seek to look beyond the individual and consider environmental contextual factors: Aim 1: Using qualitative methods, examine and compare the processes through which male: female sex ratios influence sexual networks and partnership formation and maintenance among heterosexual African-American women living in two types of census tracts: a tract that has higher male incarceration rates and a tract that has lower male incarceration rates; Aim 2: Investigate the relationship between male incarceration rates and rates of HIV and other STIs in Atlanta census tracts over time (2005- 2010); Aim 3: Explore health care service availability as a moderator of the relationship between rates of male incarceration and rates of HIV and other STIs. The long term objective of this study is to gain a greater understanding of how male incarceration rates and the health care service environment influence individuallevel sexual and reproductive health. The information gained by achieving the aims of this study could be used to inform the development of programs and policies aimed at mitigating the adverse impact of rates of male incarceration on the transmission of HIV and other STIs.  The principal investigator (hereafter PI) will use qualitative methods to achieve Aim 1 and quantitative methods to achieve Aims 2 and 3. Qualitative methods are best suited to address Aim 1 because these methods are particularly useful for understanding contextual influences and also for discovery,[3-5] both of which are important for emerging research on the macro-social determinants of STIs and HIV. The PI will interview women from two Atlanta, GA census tracts, one that has a high male incarceration rate and a low male: female sex ratio, and the other that has a low male incarceration rate and a male: female sex ratio close to 1.00. Interviews will focus on sexual networks and romantic partnership formation and maintenance. To achieve Aims 2 and 3, U.S. decennial data, STI and HIV/AIDS surveillance data, incarceration data and an inventory of health care service locations will be used to analyze the relationship between incarceration rates and STI/HIV rates in Atlanta GA census tracts, and to investigate whether spatial access to healthcare moderates these relationships. Geographic Information Software (GIS), PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS) and Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) software will be used in these analyses. Rates of HIV and other STIs are at epidemic proportions in African American populations in the U.S.[6,7] There have been calls in the literature, from the CDC and from the White House's National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States report for future studies to examine (1) how incarceration within African American communities affects HIV-risk behaviors among the sexual partners and sexual networks of those left behind and in the community at large;[8-10] (2) health care availability and sexual networks in relation to HIV and other STI health disparities.[11] The information obtained from this study could be used to inform the development of programs and policies aimed at mitigating the adverse impact of rates of male incarceration on the transmission of HIV and other STIs.","Male Incarceration, the Health Care Service Environment and Sexual Health",8262742,F31MH096630,"['abstracting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Censuses ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' LAV-2 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 2 ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type IV ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 2 ', ' HTLV-IV ', ' HIV2 ', ' HIV-II ', ' HIV-2 ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Linear Models ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Prisons ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Sex Ratio ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Life ', ' Location ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' experience ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Jail ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' surveillance data ', ' ']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2011,30480,0.04976314505099253
"Reducing Risk of HIV/STD Infection Among African American Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The high rates of sexually transmitted disease (STD), including HIV, among African American (AA) men who reside in urban areas are a major public health problem. In addition, the most common route of HIV transmission among AA women is heterosexual exposure. Yet, little research has focused on gender-specific strategies to dissuade heterosexually active AA men from engaging in high HIV/STD transmission risk behaviors. Accordingly, the broad, long-term objective of this research is to develop such strategies. The Specific Aims include testing the efficacy of a theory-based, gender-specific contextually appropriate HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention in increasing consistent condom use, identifying theoretical mediators that account for the intervention's effects, and testing a strategy to increase the longevity of the intervention's effects. This research will utilize a randomized controlled trial design with 360 inner-city AA men 18 to 45 years who report recent unprotected vaginal or anal intercourse with a woman. Men will be randomly allocated to one of two small-group interventions specially designed for AA men: (a) a HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention or (b) a health promotion control intervention on healthful diet and physical activity. To evaluate a strategy to increase the longevity of intervention effects, the men also will be randomized to receive or not receive individually tailored mailings to reinforce the intervention's message. The approach draws on social cognitive theory, the theory of planned behavior, and the applicant's Preliminary Studies with AA men. The primary outcome is self-reported consistent condom use during vaginal and heterosexual anal intercourse in the previous 3 months collected at baseline and 6 and 12 months post-intervention via audio-computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI). Secondary outcomes include other sexual behaviors and theoretical variables hypothesized to mediate intervention efficacy. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) and random effects models will be employed to address the Specific Aims.               RELEVANCE: This research may provide an urgently needed intervention to reduce the risk of STDs, including HIV, in African American men, one of the highest risk populations in the US. Moreover, African American women have 20 times the rate of HIV seen in White women, with over 75% of the cases are tied to sexual relations with men. However, few trials have tested gender-specific HIV/STD risk-reduction interventions for heterosexually active men.",Reducing Risk of HIV/STD Infection Among African American Men,8009492,R01MD004075,"['Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' secondary outcome ', ' scale up ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' behavior change ', ' Equation ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' primary outcome ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' disease transmission ', ' infectious disease transmission ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Intention ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' trial design ', ' Planning Theory ', ' urban area ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Gender ', ' inner city ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Mails ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' post intervention ', ' Woman ', ' consistent condom use ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' Attitude ', ' Native Americans ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' cost ', ' Literature ', ' Life ', ' Belief ', ' Behavior ', ' Female ', ' intervention effect ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' group intervention ', ' Reporting ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Diet ', ' male ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Affect ', ' Health ', ' Research ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Behavioral ', ' Measures ', ' Testing ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Mediating ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' base ', ' Time ', ' Address ', ' Interview ', ' Outcome ', ' Accounting ', ' Infection ', ' Physical activity ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Risk ', ' Population ', ' theories ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' high risk ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' condoms ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Route ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2011,396000,0.00770674393320103
"Syndemic Development and HIV Risk Among Vulnerable Young Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the number of new HIV infections has been relatively stable since late 1990s, the face of the infection has changed. Half of all new infections now occur among youth and substantial disparities exist based on sexual orientation. Recent data from the National HIV/AIDS Reporting System indicate that male-to-male sexual contact accounts for 76-79% of HIV diagnoses among 16-19 year old males, although less is known about the actual prevalence of HIV and related health issues in this population. Disparities also exist in preparedness to prevent HIV among young men who have sex with men (YMSM), with no proven intervention for adolescents in this vulnerable group. The epidemic of HIV among YMSM does not exist in a vacuum. Instead, YMSM experience multiple psychosocial health disparities, including elevated rates of illicit drug use, exposure to violence, and mental health problems such as suicidality. Recent evidence indicates that these health issues represent intertwined epidemics that each contribute to HIV risk among YMSM, a situation referred to as a syndemic. Building on our own research with YMSM, as well as other high risk youth, we are proposing to investigate a syndemic of psychosocial health issues linked to HIV among YMSM ages 16-20. This syndemic includes HIV risk, drug use, internalizing mental health problems, and violence exposure. The overarching goals of this study are twofold: 1) to provide much-needed epidemiological data on the prevalence of HIV and related health issues in order to inform public health priorities; and 2) to collect vital information on risk and protective factors to inform the development of an intervention targeting this vulnerable population. We will accomplish these goals with three primary specific aims: (1) Ascertain the prevalence and clustering of a syndemic of biopsychosocial health problems among YMSM. We will: (a) Recruit a representative sample of 450 ethnically diverse YMSM using Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS); (b) Assess the syndemic components using state-of-the-art approaches; (c) Use the RDS model to calculate unbiased estimators of the prevalence of syndemic components; (d) Test for the clustering of syndemic components. (2) Characterize multiple trajectories of syndemic development by following our YMSM sample longitudinally over a two year period. We will: (a) Assess youth every 6 months during the transition from late adolescence to emerging adulthood, to explore the natural history of syndemic development. (b) Use growth-mixture modeling to characterize groups of youth with different trajectory classes of syndemic development in order to allow for early identification of youth most at risk of HIV acquisition. (3) Determine the importance of YMSM-specific factors in syndemic development so as to guide the development of culturally-relevant HIV prevention interventions for our target population. We will: (a) Test the value of YMSM-specific factors as predictors of trajectory class; (b) Test the incremental value of our theoretical syndemic model for predicting HIV-related sexual risk relative to the IMB model. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) are at elevated risk for a syndemic of biopsychosocial health problems. This syndemic includes HIV risk, substance use, internalizing mental health problems, and violence exposure. The overarching goal of this study is to collect information on YMSM-specific risk and protective factors, which can then be used to inform the development of an intervention targeting this vulnerable population.              Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) are at elevated risk for a syndemic of biopsychosocial health problems.

"Gender, Power and Latino Mens HIV Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): AIDS has been a leading cause of death among Latino women and men 25 to 44 years of age for more than a decade. The few HIV prevention and treatment interventions developed specifically for Latino men have focused on injecting drug users (IDU) or men who have sex with men (MSM), but have neglected a critical epidemiological group, men who have sex with men and with women (MSMW). This group is particularly relevant in understanding the spread of HIV given the role they play in sexual network connections between the homosexually active male population and heterosexual population. The proposed study will develop an innovative pilot intervention for behaviorally bisexual Latino men. We propose the following specific aims: 1) To describe the mechanisms by which contextual factors of labor and cultural backgrounds (such as access to employment, ethnic-racial tensions, coping with job-related situations, heterosexism and gender norms in the workplace) influence bisexual men's likelihood of engaging in risky sexual practices; 2)To explore how men's notions of power are shaped by the centrality of family and religious background, and how these factors in turn, facilitate or prevent sexual risk taking among bisexual Latino men; 3) To describe bisexual Latino men's ideologies of HIV risk, the geographical context of HIV risk, and how bisexual risk behavior, and how they are related or not to gender and power dynamics in the men's lives; and, 4) To examine how the perceptions of members of AIDS Service Delivery Organizations (ASDOs) of societal notions of Latino masculinity and bisexuality create or limit access to HIV prevention services for bisexual Latino men in the New York Metropolitan Area. To accomplish these aims, we propose a 4-year ethnographic study design with two components of data collection. The first component will consists of in-depth interviews with behaviorally bisexual Latino men (n=160) from five research sites in the New York City metropolitan area. The first two years of the study will be dedicated to the in-depth interviews component. The second data collection component of the study will be an ethnography. This component will last 3 years, beginning in years 1 and 2 with key informant interviews (n=25) and continuing in year 3 with ethnographic mapping and 25 group interviews with AIDS Service Delivery Organizations across the 5 research sites. The last year of the project will focus on using Intervention Mapping (IM) to analyze the data collected and design the pilot intervention to reduce HIV risk among bisexual Latino men. The proposed study will be one of the first large-scale research projects to focus on issues of bisexuality and HIV risk among Latinos in the United States.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: 1. Given the raise in HIV cases in the United States, particularly among homosexually and bisexually active men of color, this study takes an innovative approach to the examination of HIV risk among by exploring how broad forms of social inequality and the sexual ecology of bisexual behavior among Latino men constrain the options for a relatively less powerful group of men, and how ideologies of masculinity intersect with structural social inequalities to create HIV risks for bisexual Latino men. 2. This will be one of the first large-scale research projects to focus on issues of bisexuality and HIV risk among Latinos and the first one to examine how the context of labor and sexual markets shape the sexual lives and health risks of bisexual men of color. 3. The proposed study will be one of the few research projects that utilize HIV prevention research to design a multilevel, theory and evidence-based intervention to reduce HIV/STI risk for bisexual Latino men, a consistently overlooked population in public health.           Public Health Relevance 1.

"Sex Differences: Pathophysiology of Symptomatic Non-Obstructive Coronary Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K23 Career Development Award application has been designed to launch the academic research career of the candidate, Dr. Jennifer Tremmel. Dr. Tremmel is a Cardiologist at Stanford, trained in both preventive and interventional cardiology, whose career goals are to become an independent clinical investigator and thought leader in the fields of women's cardiovascular health and sex differences in cardiovascular disease. Her career development plan centers on the research question of whether or not there is a sex difference in the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease. Specifically, she asks if women presenting with symptoms suggestive of angina, but demonstrating no angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease, are more likely than similarly presenting men to have coronary endothelial dysfunction, coronary microvascular disease, and diffuse deposition of coronary atherosclerotic plaque. Her specific aims are: 1. To compare the incidence and severity of coronary endothelial dysfunction between women and men using intracoronary acetylcholine (Ach) and quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). 2. To compare the incidence and severity of coronary microvascular disease between women and men using the coronary pressure wire to measure coronary flow reserve (CFR) and the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR). 3. To compare the epicardial artery atherosclerotic burden and distribution between women and men using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Her development plan is designed around this research, focusing on development in four key areas: 1) Sex- Based Medicine, 2) Advanced Statistical Analysis and Data Interpretation, 3) Vascular Biology, and 4) Non- invasive techniques for assessing endothelial function and coronary pathophysiology. This development will allow her to successfully conduct her research proposal and will prepare her for the next phase of her career as an independent investigator. Dr. Tremmel will be conducting her research in a premier academic environment under the supervision of outstanding mentors and collaborators. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This research has a direct relevance to public health. The burden of cardiovascular disease is great and there is a growing body of evidence describing differences between the sexes. Continued investigation into these sex differences will add to our knowledge regarding sex-based outcome disparities and should prompt a change in our current approach to diagnosis and treatment, particularly among women.

"Women's Empowerment and Sexual Risk in Zambia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed pre-doctoral fellowship project will examine the relationship of women's relative empowerment and its impact on women's risk of HIV/STD. Empowerment interventions with women have become one of the major approaches to women's sexual risk reduction, yet the empirical evidence of its impact in reducing sexual risk is limited. One critique is that empowerment programs are focused on women as individuals rather than taking into account their male, familial and community relationships. This proposed research seeks to test the widely accepted proposition that interventions that focus on empowerment are effective in reducing Zambian women's sexual risk. It also seeks to identify the nature of the relationship with women's primary male partner as a factor in both empowerment and sexual risk. Zambia is experiencing the health, economic, and social impacts of a mature HIV/AIDS epidemic, with a HIV prevalence of 14.3% for individuals between the ages of 15 and 49. The epidemic has affected all aspects of the social and economic growth and has devastated individual families, weakened all areas of the public sector, and threatened the long-term national development. Hence the need to minimize sexual risk and curb the spread of the epidemic is pressing. The specific aims of this project are to: develop a local definition of women's empowerment, document the empowerment programs available to residents in the Kanyama township (Lusaka, Zambia), identify the range of variation in women's primary relationships with men, identify the level of exposure to intervention programs and its impact on both empowerment and sexual risk, assess the nature of women's partner relationship and its relationship to empowerment and sexual risk and conduct a multivariate analysis that identifies the relative strength of independent and mediating variables in predicting women's sexual risk. The project will employ both qualitative (key informant and in-depth interviewing) and quantitative (survey instrument) methods. This project is intended to provide the formative research results needed for the development of an expanded research grant by the applicant after her PhD is awarded; to contribute to available research on the role of empowerment in sexual risk reduction; and to generate data that can positively impact on the health and well being of women in Zambia.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed pre-doctoral fellowship project will examine the relationship of women's relative empowerment and its impact on women's risk of HIV/STD. It also seeks to identify the nature of the relationship with women's primary male partner as a factor in both empowerment and sexual risk. By evaluating the effects of these two factors on women's sexual health outcomes, insight will be provided towards the design of culturally relevant interventions that will effectively reduce women's sexual risk.              The proposed pre-doctoral fellowship project will examine the relationship of women's relative empowerment and its impact on women's risk of HIV/STD.

"Young Women With Acute Myocardial Infarction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young women with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) represent an extreme phenotype in ischemic heart disease risk and, at the same time, constitute a large understudied group with excess mortality risk compared with similarly aged men. This combination of adverse risk and inadequate investigation provides a critically important opportunity to address the care and outcomes of young women with AMI to uncover key biological and environmental determinants of their prognosis. Accordingly, we propose the first large, comprehensive, observational study of young women with AMI (YWAMI). YWAMI will include 2,000 women, 18-55 years of age, with AMI and a comparison cohort of 1,000 men enrolled over 3 years from 88 hospitals across the United States and in Canada. To accomplish these aims we have assembled a team of leading researchers in sex disparities in cardiovascular disease, outcomes research, epidemiology, statistics, genetics, biomarker research, health status measurement, psychosocial research, cardiology, and emergency medicine. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) characterize sex differences in outcomes following AMI (including mortality, hospitalization and health status); 2) determine sex differences in the prevalence of demographic, clinical, and psychosocial risk factors; 3) determine sex differences in quality of care; and 4) determine sex differences in the prevalence of selected biological factors (including sex hormones, biomarkers and genetic variations). We will characterize these differences in great detail and elucidate the biological and environmental factors that are responsible for disparities in outcomes. The analyses from all four aims will be used to develop clinically useful risk-stratification models for young AMI patients, explain sex differences in outcomes and identify targets for intervention. We will also bank serum and DMA from each subject, creating a resource for anticipated future studies of the molecular biology of AMI in young women and men. We will work with the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association and VHA, Inc. to disseminate findings from this study that can be used to improve the prevention, care, and outcomes for young women and men with AMI. Public Health Implications: Overall, although heart disease in young women accounts for as many deaths as breast cancer, few studies have addressed the biological, environmental and social factors that influence their outcome. Young women with heart attacks have a higher risk of dying than similarly aged men. We propose to conduct the largest, most comprehensive study of young women with heart attacks to identify the key determinants of their recovery and discover knowledge that will assist us in improving their care.              ",Young Women With Acute Myocardial Infarction,8111685,R01HL081153,"['Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' sex steroid ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' comparison group ', ' Inpatients ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Biologic Marker ', ' Stratification ', ' neglect ', ' lipid metabolism ', ' fat metabolism ', ' Reproductive History ', ' Reproductive Issues ', ' Reproductive History Epidemiology ', ' Reproductive Factors ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' age group ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Age-Years ', ' Canada ', ' Cardiology ', ' Cardiovascular Disease (Specialty) ', ' American Heart Association ', ' functional status ', ' Clinical Investigator ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' older women ', ' Observational Study ', ' Recommendation ', ' psychosocial ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Letters ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' prognostic ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Breast ', ' sex ', ' Update ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Caring ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Cardiac ', ' cohort ', ' Physicians ', ' improved ', ' Future ', ' statistics ', ' biomarker ', ' Measurement ', ' Metabolic ', ' Time ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Symptoms ', ' high risk ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Environment ', ' Data ', ' aged ', ' Genetic ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Work ', ' Inflammation ', ' programs ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' American ', ' Age ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pattern ', ' United States ', ' Investigation ', ' Research ', ' Female ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Outcome ', ' experience ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Hospitals ', ' Prevalence ', ' Address ', ' Biological ', ' Guidelines ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recovery ', ' Woman ', ' Accounting ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' High Prevalence ', ' social ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Risk ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogenic Compounds ', ' Estrogenic Agents ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Publishing ', ' genetic variant ', ' Participant ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Collaborations ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Prevention ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Ensure ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Site ', ' Minority ', ' novel ', ' Knowledge ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Modeling ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Prognostic Factor ', ' Prognostic/Survival Factor ', ' General Prognostic Factor ', ' non-genetic ', ' nongenetic ', ' heart disease risk ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' Menstrual cycle ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' Genetic Status ', ' genetic resource ', ' ']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,2402252,0.03916140872141774
"Social capital and HIV risk behavior among rural migrants in China    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Worldwide data suggest that migrants are at increased risk of HIV infection. The high rates of HIV infection and the mobility of migrant populations make migrants a living bridge to spread the AIDS virus between the countries/places of origin and the countries/places of destination. Research findings indicate that the increased HIV infection among migrants is associated their high prevalence of HIV risk behaviors (substance use and risky sex), which in turn, are determined by socioenvironmental and situational factors. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which environmental factors lead to HIV risk behavior. Guided by the Social Capital Theory, in this project, we propose to test two hypothesized mechanisms that may link social influences to HIV risk behavior among migrants - the lack of social support (including informational, instrumental and emotional) and the weakening of informal social control (including collective efficacy and normative beliefs). Rural migrants lost their social capital (defined as durable, resource-rich, trustworthy, and reciprocal network connections a person accumulated) deeply rooted in the place of rural origin and they may experience difficulties rebuilding social capital in the urban destination due to their low socioeconomic status. Migrants with limited social capital may then experience difficulties obtaining informational, instrumental, and emotional support to establish their career and life in the stressful urban settings; consequently use of substance becomes an attractive and convenient option. The lack of social capital may also make migrants less responsive to the social capital-based collective efficacy (volunteer actions by community members against deviate behaviors that may devalue the community), increasing the likelihood to engage in sexual risk behavior. When rebuilding social capital, migrants may adopt more liberal attitudes and more open values about sex, leading to sexual risk behavior. Exposure to more opportunities in urban settings will further exacerbate the likelihood. The low SES of female migrants may explain the higher HIV risk among them than among their male counterparts. The unprecedented rural-to-urban migration in China with the growing HIV/AIDS epidemic and the high prevalence of HIV risk behavior among rural migrants provide a window opportunity to investigate these issues. We will conduct the proposed research in Wuhan, China, a metropolitan city and provincial capital with a population of 8.1 million and one million rural migrants. The proposed research is highly significant and very innovative. Data for the proposed research will be collected using probability samples. The study samples will be selected using cost-effective methods supported by the GIS/GPS technology and a sample of 1200 rural migrants will be contrasted with the same number of non- migrant residents in the rural areas from where rural migrants originate and non-migrant residents in the urban areas where the rural migrants are currently living and working. In addition to survey data, sexually transmitted infections will also be assessed. We expected that findings from this research will advance our understanding of the migration-related HIV/AIDS transmission and provide needed data supporting our next step of research - devising and implementing innovative programs for HIV prevention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to examine social capital and its relationship with HIV risk behavior and sexually transmitted infection among rural migrants in China using a random sample. This research is fully relevant to public health because the expected findings from this study will provide data supporting innovative HIV/AIDS prevention among Chinese rural migrants as well as migrants in general - a significant and global strategy in the era of frequent domestic and international population migration in response to globalization and the developmental disparities in the 21st century.           NARRATIVE In this project, we propose to examine social capital and its relationship with HIV risk behavior and sexually transmitted infection among rural migrants in China using a random sample.

"A Stress Process Model of Depression and Sexual Risk Among HIV Seropositive MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award for Individual Predoctoral Fellows in Nursing Research is to provide Aubrey Florom-Smith, a second year BSN to PhD doctoral student, with a rich and varied training experience during her dissertation period. Two years of funding are requested affording the applicant, through the proposed training plan, a hands-on experience conducting a quantitative study and increased mentorship and guidance from talented sponsors and co-mentors experienced in every facet of the proposed study. Field experiences with nationally recognized research teams and health care providers experienced in HIV/AIDS and health care issues affecting men who have sex with men living with HIV/AIDS (MLWHA) will enhance the applicant's experience. Additional graduate level coursework will further augment her knowledge of HIV/AIDS as a social, cultural, political and behavioral health issue. Further, she will enhance her career development by acquiring valuable contacts for future endeavors and disseminating her findings through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at local, national and international conferences.  The proposed cross-sectional, observational study, testing alternate stress process models predicting depression and sexual risk among MLWHA, is predicated upon the concept that stressors, in the form of gay- related or HIV-related discrimination, may impact health-related behaviors and mental health, depression and high risk sexual behavior, and that the effect of stressors can be influenced by intervening chronic strains, such as internalized homophobia and internalized HIV-related stigma. Alternate models will examine whether the intervening variables are statistical moderators or mediators. Because the chronic strains (internalized homophobia and internalized HIV-related stigma) are conceptualized as emerging from the stressors (discrimination), negative life events and social support will be explored to place these stressors within the context of the individual's stress process. Demographic variables will be examined as control variables to ensure they do not mask the effects of interest. An investigation of the pathways linking these factors may result in increased opportunities for more efficacious HIV prevention intervention development with this population.  The University of Miami School of Nursing and Health Studies, which contains the NCMHD-funded Center of Excellence for Health Disparities Research: El Centro, and which has close ties to outstanding scholars and both physical and community resources, provides an ideal setting for the proposed training plan. An NRSA would provide a solid foundation upon which the applicant could base her future efforts as a nurse scientist, educator and advocate to help reduce new HIV infections and enhance the mental and physical wellbeing of MLWHA.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Gay and bisexual men compose the group of individuals at greatest risk of acquiring HIV, as members of the at-risk group that has experienced increases in HIV infections steadily over the past several decades (CDC, 2010b). Because gay and bisexual men living with HIV or AIDS remain subject to ongoing discrimination due to HIV infection and sexual minority status, and because these factors may be related to depression and high risk sexual behavior, a better understanding of the important links between discrimination, depression and high risk sexual behavior is needed. The knowledge gained from the proposed study may be used to develop programs delivered within community or health organizations to reduce the negative effects of discrimination, and ultimately reduce the number of new HIV infections among this group of highly at-risk men.            Gay and bisexual men compose the group of individuals at greatest risk of acquiring HIV, as members of the at-risk group that has experienced increases in HIV infections steadily over the past several decades (CDC, 2010b).

"PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative (MARI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Rates of HIV infection are increasing among heterosexual young adult Black men. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advancing HIV prevention agenda calls for intervention through voluntary counseling and testing. However, young adults are less likely to be tested for HIV than older age groups and there are still large numbers of Black heterosexual men who do not get HIV tested. A goal of the study is to build HIV prevention research capacity in Black communities in which little research has been conducted. We will conduct qualitative interviews with 20 low income heterosexual young adult Black (non-Hispanic) men (ages 18-25 years) to examine barriers and facilitators to HIV testing and elicit their opinions of how to promote HIV testing among their peers. Based on the results from the qualitative interviews, a questionnaire will be developed to identify attitudes towards HIV testing, perceptions of HIV risk, socio-cultural influences (e.g., incarceration history, and male gender norms), and their relationship to HIV testing behaviors among low income heterosexual young adult Black men. Results from both the qualitative interviews and survey will be used to develop tailored educational materials that promote HIV testing among low income young adult heterosexual Black men. Three focus groups will then be conducted with low income heterosexual young adult men to evaluate the acceptability of the materials. Findings will increase our understanding of factors that influence HIV testing among Black heterosexual young adult men. In addition, HIV testing promotion materials developed through this study may have utility in increasing the number of heterosexual Black young adult men who get tested and therefore become aware of their HIV status. This proposal seeks to identify factors that influence HIV testing among low income heterosexual young adult Black men. The study will also develop tailored educational materials to promote HIV testing among this population. Specifically tailoring HIV testing messages for low income heterosexual young adult Black men may have utility in increasing the numbers among this population who get tested and therefore become aware of their HIV status. Therefore, this information may make a significant contribution to HIV prevention efforts and addresses a public health priority that fits with the goals of the US Department of Health and Human Services Healthy People 2010 initiative to eliminate health disparities related to HIV.

"Trajectories and Consequences of Nonmarital Fathering    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this project is to investigate the factors associated with men becoming unwed fathers and the nature and consequences of unmarried fathers' involvement with children. This is an important topic, given the large and growing number of men who will have at least one child outside of marriage and the large fraction of children and mothers who will be exposed to their fathering behavior. Yet, our knowledge about nonmarital fathering and how it affects partners, children, and the fathers themselves remains limited, in part because men are often under-represented in national surveys. Fathers represent an important resource for children, ideally investing the time, money and emotion that promote healthy child development and socialization, but unwed fathers often have individual and contextual characteristics that deter and complicate their potential for positive involvement in family life; these include low human capital, high rates of social-behavioral problems, and a high likelihood of living away from their child, as well as three important but little explored factors related to nonmarital fathering fathers' ongoing relationships with mothers (whether romantic and/or co-parenting), the fact that unmarried men (and women) often have children by multiple partners (so-called `multi-partnered fertility'), and the fact that a non-trivial number of unwed fathers have been or will be incarcerated. Using three national datasets (the National Survey of Family Growth, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, and the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study), this research will provide new information about the trajectories and consequences of recent and contemporary nonmarital fathering. The study includes three specific aims: 1) To evaluate the antecedents of nonmarital fatherhood and the effects of becoming an unwed father on the male life course; 2) To analyze the nature and dynamics of unwed fathers' involvement in families as partners and parents, especially as linked to relationships with mothers, multi-partnered fertility, and paternal incarceration; and 3) To examine the consequences of unmarried fathers' involvement for the wellbeing of children and of fathers themselves, including whether the benefits are moderated by fathers' characteristics or context. Using a life course perspective and drawing on family systems theory, this project will evaluate key stages and turning points in men becoming and then being unmarried fathers, including factors that both enhance and deter positive parenting over time. The study will explore race/ethnic differences in unwed fathering and consider key analytic challenges related to social selection and missing data. Overall, this study will provide new information about the process, content, and consequences of nonmarital fathering for children and families and may shed light on the development of sound policies and programs to strengthen families. PUBLIC HELATH RELEVANCE This study will provide new information about the factors associated with men becoming unwed fathers and the nature and consequences of unmarried fathers' involvement with children.

"Syndemic Production among Emergent Adult Men  PROJECT SUMMARY: Recent trends in U.S. urban centers indicate a rise in the number of new HIV infections in the population of young men who have sex with men (YMSM). These trends suggest a high level of vulnerability to HIV seroconversion in YMSM through sexual behavior as they emerge into adulthood. In addition, acts of sexual risk taking in this population often function synergistically with illicit drug use, and mental health burden. Despite some success with HIV prevention in the MSM population during the last 25 years, these recent patterns suggest that a reexamination of our prevention strategies for this population, especially for YMSM of color, is needed. Given the interplay that exists between unprotected sexual behavior, illicit drug use, and mental health burden, all such efforts must consider how these overlapping epidemics (also known as syndemics) fuel each other in a cohort of YMSM as they emerge into adulthood. Thus, we will we will initiate a prospective longitudinal program of research to follow the development of syndemics in a racially/ethnically and economically diverse cohort of urban HIV-negative YMSM in New York City as they transition from adolescence into young adulthood, and apply, test, and further develop a theory of syndemic production to understand the development of both maladaptive and adaptive behavioral outcomes. Specifically we seek to (1) develop and test theoretically informed measurement models of the covariance of illicit drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and mental health burden among emergent adult HIV-negative YMSM within and across time, (2) assess whether patterns of behavior are continuous, discontinuous, or some combination of both; (3) delineate the risk and protective bases-physical factors (i.e., pubertal onset, HIV status), relational factors (i.e., family history of psychopathology, current romantic relationships, peer support, and characteristics of residential, social, and sex neighborhoods), and psychosocial factors (i.e., sexual identity, internalized homophobia, hypermasculinity, racial identity, racial devaluation, HIV optimism) that predict the development of syndemics, and (4) determine the extent to which the development of syndemics varies by race/ethnicity, social class, and homelessness/housing stability in a cohort of HIV-negative YMSM. Using multiple measurement modalities, which include biological assays, calendar based methods, and self-reports, we will follow the development of 675, 18-year-old HIV-negative YMSM. Participants will be recruited through venue-based and respondent driven sampling, as they emerge into adulthood, over seven waves of data collection within a 36-month time frame. We will utilize Structural Equation and Latent Growth Curve Analysis to answer our four main research questions.  RELEVANCE The goal of this project is to understand why a new generation of young men who have sex with other men place themselves at risk for HIV transmission. Knowledge which we will generate will help us understand how these young men emerge into adulthood, the choices they make about sexual behavior and illicit drug use, as well as how these two behaviors interact with their mental health. We seek to understand why some men exhibit risky behaviors as they emerge into adulthood while others do not. Working with community and municipal partners, we will draw from what we have learned from both groups to develop strategies for HIV prevention and intervention that are relevant to this current and developing generation who did not live through the devastation of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980's.

"Cancer Disparities in California    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific subgroups of the population bear a greater cancer burden than the general population. It has been hypothesized, and from our own prior studies we have preliminary evidence, that sexual minorities are among the population groups to experience cancer disparities. The lack of reliable population-based cancer data systems that include sexual orientation impedes the confirmation of the existence of cancer disparities due to sexual orientation. The main goal of this secondary data analysis is to link two California-specific data sources, cancer registry data and a statewide population-based survey that measured sexual orientation, to assess cancer disparities due to sexual orientation. Using county-level data on sexual orientation, we will test the hypothesis that geographic areas in which more sexual minorities (defined as self-identified gay, lesbian, bisexuals) are concentrated have higher breast, lung and colorectal cancer incidence, more advanced stage at diagnosis, and greater cancer mortality compared to areas with fewer sexual minorities. We have four specific aims to identify breast, lung and colorectal cancer disparities in California: 1. Examine the relationship of breast, lung, and colorectal cancer incidence to the area-specific percentage of sexual minority populations (defined as women or men who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual) in California counties. 2. Determine the rate of late stage breast and colorectal cancer diagnoses to the area-specific percentage of sexual minority populations (defined as women or men who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual) in California counties. 3. Compare breast, lung, and colorectal cancer mortality as a function of the area-specific percentage of sexual minority populations (defined as women or men who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual) in California counties. 4. Compare California counties on breast, lung, and colorectal cancer incidence, late stage diagnosis, and mortality as a function of Census-derived area-specific percentage of same-sex partnered households to area-specific estimates derived from self-reported sexual orientation information. To date, ""true"" population-based estimates of cancers in sexual minorities are not known, yet urgently needed. Our methodological approach can provide information about disparities due to sexual orientation in California, and provide for information to be later utilized to focus interventions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Results from this study will show whether sexual minorities bear a disproportionate burden in California with respect to breast, lung, and colorectal cancers. If this innovative data use is successful, it can be replicated in other states, which also collect data on sexual orientation of their population and can ultimately be proposed as a useful tool for state health officials. In the absence of cancer surveillance data on sexual minorities, this tool can inform about within state disparities due to sexual orientation, and provide for information that can help focus interventions. Ultimately, this epidemiological approach to cancer disparities is a necessary first step on which we expect to build with follow-up research focused on understanding and eliminating disparities linked to sexual orientation.           Project Narrative Results from this study will show whether sexual minorities bear a disproportionate burden in California with respect to breast, lung, and colorectal cancers.

"Development and Testing of a Syndemic Model among Gay and Bisexual Male Adolescen    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The training goal of this career development grant is to become an independent scientific investigator contributing to the understanding of the social processes through which gay and bisexual male adolescents and emerging adults (GBMAEA) develop a range of health disparities, including HIV/AIDS, depression, and substance use. These processes require investigation in order to inform the development of multilevel and structural interventions to eliminate these disparities. In order to achieve these goals, I propose to develop and apply skills in the areas of adolescent development, psychosocial scale development and validation, latent class analysis and mixed models. Dr. Gary Harper will oversee my professional development under this proposal. In addition to supervising my progress through the proposed research and training plan, Dr. Harper will supervise my training in two areas of skill development: qualitative data analysis methods and adolescent development theories and applications. Dr. Isa Fernandez will act as a co-mentor and senior methodologist working with me on secondary data analysis, sampling and recruitment methods and supervision of my grantsmanship and R01 proposal development. Dr. Richard Campbell will act as a co-mentor and supervise my training in statistical methods, including psychosocial scale validation, item response analysis, latent class analysis, and mixed models. Dr. Ron Stall will act as a co- mentor and supervise my training in developing and testing a model of syndemic production of HIV/AIDS and health disparities. The goal of the proposed research is to empirically test a model of syndemic production of negative health outcomes among GBMAEA, and to investigate possible resiliencies among this population that are associated with positive health outcomes. I will assess (a) how these male adolescents and emerging adults perceive, experience and internalize gay-related stigma, (b) how sexual identity development is correlated with the perception, experience, and internalization of gay-related stigma, (c) to what degree these stigma processes and sexual identity development are associated to a range of health risk indicators, and (d) to what degree perceived social support moderates the effects of stigma and sexual identity development on health behaviors. This application supports the mission of the National Institute of Mental Health by producing data on sexual identity development trajectories, gay-related stigma, and health behaviors of GBMAEA that will help inform the development of theoretically sound multi-level and structural interventions in the future to address HIV/AIDS and health disparities among this population.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the U.S., men who have sex with men are affected by marked health disparities, including elevated rates of HIV infection, substance use, and depression, that may be syndemically produced as responses to marginalization during adolescence. The research component of this career development grant will develop and test a syndemic model among gay and bisexual male adolescents and emerging adults (GBMAEA).

"Social and structural context of HIV/STI risk among FSWs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this application is to use social epidemiological methods to prospectively evaluate the impact of social, environmental, and structural factors on partner-level sexual and drug risk patterns and HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence among FSWs and to assess the feasibility of a subsequent HIV/STI intervention targeting FSWs in public place-based settings (e.g. bars, streets). Despite growing evidence of the effectiveness of environmental-structural HIV/STI interventions targeting FSWs, this research has been largely derived from developing country settings and establishment-based venues, and there is limited prospective data on the social and structural context of HIV/STI risk among FSWs in North America. Given recent reports suggest a temporal shift from an injection to a sexually-driven HIV epidemic among street-involved populations in many North American settings, there is a crucial need for more prospective data on the contextual factors promoting and constraining partner-level sexual and drug risk patterns and HIV/STI acquisition. Vancouver, Canada is ideally suited for the proposed study for several reasons. First, due to the quasi-criminalized nature of sex work and large informal tolerance zones, we are in a unique position to evaluate the context of HIV/STI risk among FSWs, not currently feasible in most US cities. Second, unlike many urban environments where the FSW community is fragmented, the current social and legal context of sex work in Canada, our ability to harness strong community FSW support for this application, and new supportive housing models currently operating legally as quasi-brothels demonstrate significant innovation and strong potential for a subsequent intervention stemming from the results of this research. Herein we propose to create an open prospective cohort of 500 active FSWs working in public place-based settings, including interview administered questionnaires and HIV/STI screening at baseline and 6monthly follow-up over a five year period. To our knowledge this study is among the first prospective studies of public place-based sex work in North America and as such, we will be uniquely positioned to evaluate the risk environment and temporal trends in partner-level risks and HIV/STI acquisition among FSWs. This research will address several questions central to the urgent challenges facing HIV/STI prevention capacity in North America and will directly assess the feasibility of a subsequent intervention that will be of critical importance to other developed country settings.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While there is growing concern in many North American cities of a temporal shift from an injection to a sexually-driven HIV epidemic, there has been limited prospective evaluation of the broader risk environment and HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence among FSWs. Using social epidemiological methods, this research will address this gap by evaluating the impact of the physical and social environment, gender inequities, and structural factors on partner-level sexual and drug risk patterns and HIV/STI acquisition among an open cohort of 500 FSWs.           PROJECT NARRATIVE While there is growing concern in many North American cities of a temporal shift from an injection to a sexually-driven HIV epidemic, there has been limited prospective evaluation of the broader risk environment and HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence among FSWs.

"A Brief, Clinic-Based, HIV Prevention Program for African American Teen Males    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has declared that AIDS is a ""state of emergency"" in the US relative to African Americans. Teen males attending STD clinics are one important, yet often neglected, population of African Americans at risk of HIV acquisition. Despite extremely high rates of STD acquisition (and subsequent infection) among this population, effective clinic-based interventions specifically designed to reduce their sexual risk behavior for STD/HIV have not been developed/disseminated. A recent intervention trial (conducted by Dr. Crosby) demonstrated the efficacy of a brief, clinic-based, intervention designed to prevent subsequent STI acquisition among African American males 18 to 29 years of age. The proposed study will test the efficacy this intervention (in modified form) to reduce STI incidence among African American teen (15 to 20 years old). The primary hypothesis is that teens randomized to receive the intervention will have a lower incidence rate of laboratory-confirmed STIs at 2 and 6-month follow-up assessments (as well as 12-month follow-up conducted by a medical records review) compared to those receiving an attention-equivalent control condition. Teens (N = 840) will be recruited from a publicly-funded STD clinic located in an urban area of the South. After completing an A-CASI assessment, teens will be rated on their ability to apply condoms to a penile model and then asked to donate a urine specimen for STI testing. Specimens will be tested for C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and T. Vaginalis using nucleic acid amplification assays. Randomization will then be achieved by a concealment of allocation technique. Teens will be randomized to immediately receive: 1) a brief (60 minute) theory-based, one-on-one, interactive intervention delivered by a lay health advisor or 2) an attention equivalent control condition. The assessment battery will be repeated 2 months subsequent to enrollment and again 6 months after enrollment. A medical records review will be conducted 12 months after enrollment to compare clinic reported incidence rates between the randomized groups of teens. If incidence of STIs in this population of teens can be decreased as substantially as was found in the previous study of 18 to 29 year-old African American males (percent relative difference = 36.7), the public health significance for African American teen males will substantially contribute to rectify the racial disparity in HIV/STD experienced by African American teen males. By extension, we suggest that their partners (typically African American teen females) will also benefit. Because our program is designed for ease of implementation, the number of dissemination and translation issues will be greatly minimized thereby greatly facilitating the process of translating research into practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed efficacy trial tests an innovative method of bridging the gap between research and practice. By providing a brief, clinic-based, HIV/STD prevention program to African American teen males attending an STD clinic, the study will be the first to demonstrate that teen's sexual risk behavior can be reduced without excessive time and resources. The focus on African American teen males is also quite timely given the recent declaration by CDC that AIDS is a ""state of emergency"" for African Americans.          ","A Brief, Clinic-Based, HIV Prevention Program for African American Teen Males",8097343,R01MH083621,"['Intervention Trial ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Glare ', ' Medical Records ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Instruction ', ' neglect ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Low income ', ' post intervention ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Translating ', ' intervention effect ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' arm ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Health Educators ', ' Translations ', ' Age-Years ', ' Science ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Perception ', ' Prevention program ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Nucleic Acids ', ' intervention program ', ' effective intervention ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' male ', ' Laboratories ', ' experience ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Woman ', ' Techniques ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Caring ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Reporting ', ' efficacy trial ', ' efficacy testing ', ' sex ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Infection ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' theories ', ' Services ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' 20 year old ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' United States ', ' Goals ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Testing ', ' Attention ', ' improved ', ' Time ', ' Female ', ' Life ', ' Work ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' base ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Population ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' Future ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Incidence ', ' Funding ', ' Methods ', ' Health ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' response ', ' urban area ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Neisseria gonorrhoeae ', ' N.gonorrhoeae ', ' N. gonorrhoeae ', ' Gonococcus ', ' avoid sex ', ' Trichomonas vaginalis ', ' T. vaginalis ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' Chlamydia ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Trichomonas Infections ', ' trichomoniasis ', ' Trichomonosis ', ' Disease due to Trichomonadidae ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' research to practice ', ' research into practice ', ' Brothers ', ' safer sex ', ' condoms ', ' Kentucky ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2011,362588,0.032206087984981945
"Epigenetic Regulation Of Sex-dependent Liver Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma HCC) arises in men more than three times as often as women. Liver cancer also disproportionately affects male rodents, providing a valuable model to study mechanisms of sex-dependent hepatocarcinogenesis. We and others have shown that proinflammatory cytokines, not sex hormones, are the primary drivers of male tumor promotion. However, the process is not cytokine-specific. Interruption of either TNF-a, IFN-g or IL-6 reduces experimental liver cancer in male mice. Therefore, cancer predilection appears to be an innate characteristic of the masculinized liver. Sex-dependent hepatocyte programming, not upstream immunity, may explain gender-dimorphic tumor incidence. We have reported that HCC in male mice is associated with loss of a sex-specific genome-wide transcriptional signature, a process termed liver-gender disruption. Such pan-chromosomal alterations implicate chromatin disruption in hepatocellular transformation. Moreover, we and others have shown that male HCC susceptibility is maturationally imprinted, as there is a decreasing benefit of castration with advancing age. Liver masculinization is enacted by pulsatile growth hormone from the pituitary. Hepatocytes transduce this signal through Stat5b, which translocates to the nucleus and initiates the male transcription program. Liver masculinization involves the synchronous alteration of thousands of genes, suggesting involvement of root-level chromatin modifiers. Nevertheless, while nucleosomal relaxation may facilitate required Stat5b access to g-associated sequences (GAS) and other DNA motifs, an unintended consequence might be disproportionate binding of closely related proinflammatory transcription factors. Because of this, we hypothesize that masculine Stat5b-dependent epigenetic remodeling invokes chromatin hypersensitivity to tumor-promoting proinflammatory cytokines. Unfortunately, molecular studies of gender-specific hepatocyte function have been hampered by the lack of a suitable continuous cell line. We have developed a sexually dimorphic continuous hepatocyte culture system, and propose here to use it to probe epigenetic mechanisms that define a chromatin state as masculine or feminine. Next, we will test whether the masculine epigenetic profile increases sensitivity to proinflammatory cytokines by facilitating access of transcription factors (Stat1, Stat3, NF-kB) to cognate DNA sequences. Cell studies will be complemented with comprehensive in vivo epigenetic profiling of male and female liver in wild- type C57BL/6 and Stat5b-/- mice. A proinflammatory chemical injury model (DEN) will be used to assess transcription factor binding and acute-phase responses, with an emphasis on sexually dimorphic genes. Finally, we will determine whether Stat5b deficiency is sufficient to protect male mice from DEN-initiated HCC, suggesting a common downstream mechanism for susceptibility to inflammation-associated liver cancer. These studies are the first to define epigenetic modifiers of liver sexual differentiation, and to interrogate a novel mechanism of gender-specific tumor promotion predicated on chromatin sensitivity to inflammation.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma, the fastest rising cancer in the United States, exhibits marked gender disparity. These studies explore a cellular basis for liver sexual differentiation based on DNA and associated protein modifications, and show how inflammation may selectively increase cancer risk in men.           Hepatocellular carcinoma, the fastest rising cancer in the United States, exhibits marked gender disparity.

"STI/HIV Prevention: Sexual milieu of African American College Students    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Due to their enhanced risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV/AIDS, the need to target young African American men and women in college is substantial and there is a significant contribution to be made in designing risk reduction interventions that are specifically targeted to this group. Sixty-one percent of people under 25 diagnosed with HIV/AIDS during 2001-2004 were African American (CDC, 2007). The disproportionate number of cases among this group, combined with the high levels of sexual experimentation and prevalence of STIs among young people, suggests that African American college students are at higher risk and should be a programmatic AND research priority. For many students, the college environment provides a sense of new independence, self-determination, and peer pressure to engage in risky sexual behaviors. Therefore, this study will investigate a culturally grounded, multi-dimensional model of student sexual decision-making and behavior among African American students attending a historically Black institution in North Carolina. This model hypothesizes that sexual decision-making and behavior are shaped by psychosocial factors such as gender role identity, sociosexual orientation, and perceived mate availability. These factors are mediated by perceived vulnerability and social norms, and moderated by varying levels of perceived self- efficacy, spirituality/religiosity, and sensation-seeking. The study uses a three-phase, successive mixed-method approach. The qualitative data obtained from 96 students in Phase I (focus groups) will be used to operationalize the constructs used to inform the quantitative survey (320 students) in Phase II. Phase III (townhalls) is designed to function as an efficient way to disseminate the information to the student body with a goal of building a campuswide prevention initiative. A better understanding of factors associated with African American college students' risky and responsible sexual behavior is needed to help guide the development of strategies and interventions to reduce the rate of HIV infection in this population, and advance the translation of culturally grounded research into effective practice.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The disproportionate number of HIV/AIDS cases among African Americans, combined with the high levels of sexual experimentation and prevalence of STIs among young people, suggests that the sexual milieu of African American college students is an area where more culturally and ecologically appropriate research is necessary. For many students, the college environment provides a sense of new independence and self-determination, plus also peer pressure to engage in risky sexual behaviors. Given the extended latency period for developing observable HIV-related symptoms, it is likely that many adults with AIDS were infected when they were college students (Bazargan, Kelly, Stein, Husaini, & Bazargan, 2000), which is why studying this population is so important. Therefore, this study will investigate a culturally grounded, multi-dimensional model of student sexual decision-making and behavior among African American students attending a historically Black institution in North Carolina. This model hypothesizes that sexual decision-making and behavior are shaped by psychosocial factors such as gender role identity, sociosexual orientation, and perceived mate availability. These factors are mediated by perceived vulnerability and social norms, and moderated by varying levels of perceived self-efficacy, spirituality/religiosity, and sensation-seeking. The study uses a three-phase, successive mixed-method approach. A total of 416 students will be recruited during phases I and II.

"An HIV Intervention Tailored for Black YMSM in the House Ball Community    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent HIV surveillance data show that men who have sex with men (MSM) are the only risk group in which the number of new infections rose annually from 2001-2006 (Hall et al., 2008). Among persons aged 13-24, Blacks are disproportionately affected by HIV infection accounting for 55% of all HIV infections reported (CDC, 2005). These racial disparities among MSM persist in the Chicago area, with the HIV prevalence rate among Black MSM (30.1%) more than twice that of White (11.3%) and Hispanic MSM (12.0%) (Chicago Department of Public Health, 2009). The racial disparity in HIV prevalence rate is even more striking among youth ages 18-24, with 24.2% among Black YMSM compared to 2.3% for White YMSM and 6.5% for Hispanic YMSM (CDPH, 2009). Despite the urgent need, there are no theoretically based, culturally appropriate behavioral interventions to reduce the risk of sexual acquisition or transmission of HIV among BYMSM.  Furthermore, there are no HIV prevention interventions specifically targeting the House Ball community, an understudied and clandestine subculture of the Black gay community with high HIV prevalence (Sanchez et al., 2009; Marks et al., 2008; Murill et al., 2005).   The d-up! Defend Yourself"" intervention, which has shown efficacy with BMSM (Jones et al., 2008), may be particularly well-suited for reaching BYMSM in the House Ball community. An adaptation of Kelly's Popular Opinion leader (POL) intervention ((Kelly et al., 1991,1992,1997,2006; Fernandez et al., 2003, 2005),  d-up! Defend Yourself! utilizes opinion leaders from within the community to change social norms and  perceptions of BMSM regarding safer sex practices (Jones et al., 2008). d-up! is delivered by members of the  targeted community, thus providing ""intravention"", an approach most appropriate for insulated and  marginalized communities such as the House Ball community (Bailey, 2009; Friedman et al., 2004).   In this application, we propose to tailor the d-up! intervention for relevance with the Chicago House Ball  community and then conduct a small, pilot trial to test for feasibility and acceptability. We will begin by  conducting a series of focus groups in order to identify persuasive, culturally-appropriate messages and  identify intervention targets. Based on focus group data, we will then tailor the intervention to be relevant for  the Chicago House Ball community. We will then use Kelly and colleagues (2004) procedures for identifying popular opinion leaders from within the community and inviting them to participate in the study. We will implement a baseline community risk assessment by obtaining a convenience sample of approximately 150 youth attending the School of Opulence over three consecutive weeks. Then, opinion leaders will be trained on the tailored intervention over a period of four weeks. We will conduct four equally spaced (3, 6, 9, 12 months post-baseline) cross-sectional follow-up assessments of convenience samples of youth (i.e. approximately 150 youth at each time point) from the House Ball community. The follow-up assessments will include measures of sexual risk behavior in the past 3 months and exposure to the intervention through opinion leaders and marketing materials over the past 3 months. Opinion leaders will be asked to rate the acceptability of the intervention and the feasibility of communicating risk reduction messages within their social networks.  Feasibility of the overall intervention will also be assessed by the number of opinion leaders recruited that  agreed to be trained, the number of risk reduction conversations documented by opinion leaders, and retention  of the opinion leaders over the project period.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: For this application, we will examine the feasibility and acceptability of a popular opinion leader intervention for use with Black, young men who have sex with men that participate in the House Ball community in Chicago. The aim of such an intervention is to decrease HIV infections in a community already disproportionately impacted by HIV. This intervention has great potential to directly impact the lives of young men who have sex with men in the House Ball community and to decrease HIV transmission to sexual partners inside and outside of the community.             PROJECT NARRATIVE  For this application, we will examine the feasibility and acceptability of a popular opinion leader  intervention for use with Black, young men who have sex with men that participate in the House  Ball community in Chicago.

"Trajectories and Consequences of Nonmarital Fathering Project Summary The overall aim of this project is to investigate the factors associated with men becoming unwed fathers and the nature and consequences of unmarried fathers' involvement with children. This is an important topic, given the large and growing number of men who will have at least one child outside of marriageand the large fraction of children and mothers who will be exposed to their fathering behavior. Yet, our knowledge about nonmarital fathering and how it affects partners, children, and the fathers themselves remains limited, in part because men are often under-represented in national surveys. Fathers represent an important resource for children, ideally investing the time, money and emotion that promote healthy child development and socialization, but unwed fathers often have individual and contextual characteristics that deter and complicate their potential for positive involvement in family life; these include low human capital, high rates of social-behavioral problems, and a high likelihood of living away from their child, as well as three important but little explored factors related to nonmarital fatheringfathers' ongoing relationships with mothers (whether romantic and/or co-parenting), the fact that unmarried men (and women) often have children by multiple partners (so-called `multi-partnered fertility'), and the fact that a non-trivial number of unwed fathers have been or will be incarcerated. Using three national datasets (the National Survey of Family Growth, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, and the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study), this research will provide new information about the trajectories and consequences of recent and contemporary nonmarital fathering. The study includes three specific aims: 1) To evaluate the antecedents of nonmarital fatherhood and the effects of becoming an unwed father on the male life course; 2) To analyze the nature and dynamics of unwed fathers' involvement in families as partners and parents, especially as linked to relationships with mothers, multi-partnered fertility, and paternal incarceration; and 3) To examine the consequences of unmarried fathers' involvement for the wellbeing of children and of fathers themselves, including whether the benefits are moderated by fathers' characteristics or context. Using a life course perspective and drawing on family systems theory, this project will evaluate key stages and turning points in men becomingand then beingunmarried fathers, including factors that both enhance and deter positive parenting over time. The study will explore race/ethnic differences in unwed fathering and consider key analytic challenges related to social selection and missing data. Overall, this study will provide new information about the process, content, and consequences of nonmarital fathering for children and families and may shed light on the development of sound policies and programs to strengthen families. Project Narrative This study will provide new information about the factors associated with men becoming unwed fathers and the nature and consequences of unmarried fathers' involvement with children. Given the rising fraction of births that occur outside of marriageand the negative consequences of father absence for children, this study will provide information to aid the development of sound policies and programs to keep fathers connected to children and to strengthen families across diverse contexts.

"Young Women With Acute Myocardial Infarction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young women with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) represent an extreme phenotype in ischemic heart disease risk and, at the same time, constitute a large understudied group with excess mortality risk compared with similarly aged men. This combination of adverse risk and inadequate investigation provides a critically important opportunity to address the care and outcomes of young women with AMI to uncover key biological and environmental determinants of their prognosis. Accordingly, we propose the first large, comprehensive, observational study of young women with AMI (YWAMI). YWAMI will include 2,000 women, 18-55 years of age, with AMI and a comparison cohort of 1,000 men enrolled over 3 years from 88 hospitals across the United States and in Canada. To accomplish these aims we have assembled a team of leading researchers in sex disparities in cardiovascular disease, outcomes research, epidemiology, statistics, genetics, biomarker research, health status measurement, psychosocial research, cardiology, and emergency medicine. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) characterize sex differences in outcomes following AMI (including mortality, hospitalization and health status); 2) determine sex differences in the prevalence of demographic, clinical, and psychosocial risk factors; 3) determine sex differences in quality of care; and 4) determine sex differences in the prevalence of selected biological factors (including sex hormones, biomarkers and genetic variations). We will characterize these differences in great detail and elucidate the biological and environmental factors that are responsible for disparities in outcomes. The analyses from all four aims will be used to develop clinically useful risk-stratification models for young AMI patients, explain sex differences in outcomes and identify targets for intervention. We will also bank serum and DMA from each subject, creating a resource for anticipated future studies of the molecular biology of AMI in young women and men. We will work with the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association and VHA, Inc. to disseminate findings from this study that can be used to improve the prevention, care, and outcomes for young women and men with AMI. Public Health Implications: Overall, although heart disease in young women accounts for as many deaths as breast cancer, few studies have addressed the biological, environmental and social factors that influence their outcome. Young women with heart attacks have a higher risk of dying than similarly aged men. We propose to conduct the largest, most comprehensive study of young women with heart attacks to identify the key determinants of their recovery and discover knowledge that will assist us in improving their care.

"Gender, Power and Latino Mens HIV Risk  PROJECT SUMMARY AIDS has been a leading cause of death among Latino women and men 25 to 44 years of age for more than a decade. The few HIV prevention and treatment interventions developed specifically for Latino men have focused on injecting drug users (IDU) or men who have sex with men (MSM), but have neglected a critical epidemiological group, men who have sex with men and with women (MSMW). This group is particularly relevant in understanding the spread of HIV given the role they play in sexual network connections between the homosexually active male population and heterosexual population. The proposed study will develop an innovative pilot intervention for behaviorally bisexual Latino men. We propose the following specific aims: 1) To describe the mechanisms by which contextual factors of labor and cultural backgrounds (such as access to employment, ethnic-racial tensions, coping with job-related situations, heterosexism and gender norms in the workplace) influence bisexual men's likelihood of engaging in risky sexual practices; 2)To explore how men's notions of power are shaped by the centrality of family and religious background, and how these factors in turn, facilitate or prevent sexual risk taking among bisexual Latino men; 3) To describe bisexual Latino men's ideologies of HIV risk, the geographical context of HIV risk, and how bisexual risk behavior, and how they are related or not to gender and power dynamics in the men's lives; and, 4) To examine how the perceptions of members of AIDS Service Delivery Organizations (ASDOs) of societal notions of Latino masculinity and bisexuality create or limit access to HIV prevention services for bisexual Latino men in the New York Metropolitan Area. To accomplish these aims, we propose a 4-year ethnographic study design with two components of data collection. The first component will consists of in-depth interviews with behaviorally bisexual Latino men (n=160) from five research sites in the New York City metropolitan area. The first two years of the study will be dedicated to the in-depth interviews component. The second data collection component of the study will be an ethnography. This component will last 3 years, beginning in years 1 and 2 with key informant interviews (n=25) and continuing in year 3 with ethnographic mapping and 25 group interviews with AIDS Service Delivery Organizations across the 5 research sites. The last year of the project will focus on using Intervention Mapping (IM) to analyze the data collected and design the pilot intervention to reduce HIV risk among bisexual Latino men. The proposed study will be one of the first large-scale research projects to focus on issues of bisexuality and HIV risk among Latinos in the United States.  Public Health Relevance 1. Given the raise in HIV cases in the United States, particularly among  homosexually and bisexually active men of color, this study takes an  innovative approach to the examination of HIV risk among by exploring how  broad forms of social inequality and the sexual ecology of bisexual behavior  among Latino men constrain the options for a relatively less powerful group of  men, and how ideologies of masculinity intersect with structural social  inequalities to create HIV risks for bisexual Latino men. 2. This will be one of the first large-scale research projects to focus on issues of  bisexuality and HIV risk among Latinos and the first one to examine how the  context of labor and sexual markets shape the sexual lives and health risks of  bisexual men of color. 3. The proposed study will be one of the few research projects that utilize HIV  prevention research to design a multilevel, theory and evidence-based  intervention to reduce HIV/STI risk for bisexual Latino men, a consistently  overlooked population in public health.","Gender, Power and Latino Mens HIV Risk",8318027,R01HD056948,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Behavior ', ' Bisexuality ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Cultural Backgrounds ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Employment ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Interview ', ' male ', ' Maps ', ' Marketing ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Persons ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Gender ', ' Latino ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Workplace ', ' Bisexual ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Shapes ', ' programs ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' Services ', ' metropolitan ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' prevention service ', ' member ', ' social inequality ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Age-Years ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' informant ', ' neglect ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' male group ', "" men's group "", ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' public health priorities ', ' MSMW ', ' men who have sex with men and women ', ' ']",NICHD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2012,458530,0.03270512601887095
"Trauma, Microfinance and HIV Risk Behaviors in DRCongo     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pervasive sexual and gender based violence (SGBV) in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) causes severe outcomes for the physical, psychological, and economic health of young women. Research is currently being conducted to determine the effects of village-led microfinance in reintegrating SGBV survivors into their families and communities to improve women's physical, psychological, and economic health. However, current research has shown that post-rape services are not reaching young unmarried women between the ages 15 to 24 in the region. Young women of this age are highly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, particularly after a traumatic event such as an incident of SGBV. This study will investigate how microfinance affects the mental health and HIV sexual risk behavior of young unmarried women within an existing study.  Research participants will be asked to self-report HIV sexual risk behavior in a series of survey questions. Risk behaviors such as multiple sexual partners and condom usage will be measured at baseline, and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-baseline. A secondary data analysis will be conducted comparing HIV sexual risk behavior with demographic and mental health measures over time. Although sexual risk behavior data will be collected for 500 women in both the microfinance intervention group (n=250) compared to the delayed control group (n=250), this study will focus on the effects of microfinance on HIV sexual risk behaviors of young unmarried women between the ages of 15-24. It is hypothesized that young unmarried women in the intervention group will report fewer sexual risk behaviors than women in the delayed control group.  In-depth qualitative interviews with a subsample of young unmarried women (n=50, five from each of the ten villages) will explore reasons behind status of health, mental health, and HIV sexual risk behavior. Of particular interest in these interviews is the relationship between conflict-setting and SGBV trauma, a microfinance intervention, and sexual risk behavioral outcomes. Interviews will be conducted at baseline and 18 months post-intervention to compare the types of responses and evaluate the impact of microfinance in the lives of young unmarried women with regards to coping with traumatic experiences and impact on HIV sexual risk behaviors. Collaboration between the study investigator and local Congolese experts trained in sensitive (to SGBV survivors) research methods will explore how trauma survivors view microfinance and if microfinance has affected their sexual risk behaviors. Acknowledging safety concerns for participants and researchers in this conflict setting, every precaution will be taken through the complex safety system that Congolese partners have developed over the past fifteen years of successfully working in this conflict setting. Interviews will take place in a safe participant-selected setting for 90 minutes, asking open-ended questions, and only exploring what young women are comfortable with.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study investigates how microfinance affects the mental health outcomes and HIV/AIDS sexual risk behaviors of young unmarried women participating in an existing research study in the post-conflict setting of Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.

"Syndemic Development and HIV Risk Among Vulnerable Young Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the number of new HIV infections has been relatively stable since late 1990s, the face of the infection has changed. Half of all new infections now occur among youth and substantial disparities exist based on sexual orientation. Recent data from the National HIV/AIDS Reporting System indicate that male-to-male sexual contact accounts for 76-79% of HIV diagnoses among 16-19 year old males, although less is known about the actual prevalence of HIV and related health issues in this population. Disparities also exist in preparedness to prevent HIV among young men who have sex with men (YMSM), with no proven intervention for adolescents in this vulnerable group. The epidemic of HIV among YMSM does not exist in a vacuum. Instead, YMSM experience multiple psychosocial health disparities, including elevated rates of illicit drug use, exposure to violence, and mental health problems such as suicidality. Recent evidence indicates that these health issues represent intertwined epidemics that each contribute to HIV risk among YMSM, a situation referred to as a syndemic. Building on our own research with YMSM, as well as other high risk youth, we are proposing to investigate a syndemic of psychosocial health issues linked to HIV among YMSM ages 16-20. This syndemic includes HIV risk, drug use, internalizing mental health problems, and violence exposure. The overarching goals of this study are twofold: 1) to provide much-needed epidemiological data on the prevalence of HIV and related health issues in order to inform public health priorities; and 2) to collect vital information on risk and protective factors to inform the development of an intervention targeting this vulnerable population. We will accomplish these goals with three primary specific aims: (1) Ascertain the prevalence and clustering of a syndemic of biopsychosocial health problems among YMSM. We will: (a) Recruit a representative sample of 450 ethnically diverse YMSM using Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS); (b) Assess the syndemic components using state-of-the-art approaches; (c) Use the RDS model to calculate unbiased estimators of the prevalence of syndemic components; (d) Test for the clustering of syndemic components. (2) Characterize multiple trajectories of syndemic development by following our YMSM sample longitudinally over a two year period. We will: (a) Assess youth every 6 months during the transition from late adolescence to emerging adulthood, to explore the natural history of syndemic development. (b) Use growth-mixture modeling to characterize groups of youth with different trajectory classes of syndemic development in order to allow for early identification of youth most at risk of HIV acquisition. (3) Determine the importance of YMSM-specific factors in syndemic development so as to guide the development of culturally-relevant HIV prevention interventions for our target population. We will: (a) Test the value of YMSM-specific factors as predictors of trajectory class; (b) Test the incremental value of our theoretical syndemic model for predicting HIV-related sexual risk relative to the IMB model.

"Reducing Risk of HIV/STD Infection Among African American Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The high rates of sexually transmitted disease (STD), including HIV, among African American (AA) men who reside in urban areas are a major public health problem. In addition, the most common route of HIV transmission among AA women is heterosexual exposure. Yet, little research has focused on gender-specific strategies to dissuade heterosexually active AA men from engaging in high HIV/STD transmission risk behaviors. Accordingly, the broad, long-term objective of this research is to develop such strategies. The Specific Aims include testing the efficacy of a theory-based, gender-specific contextually appropriate HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention in increasing consistent condom use, identifying theoretical mediators that account for the intervention's effects, and testing a strategy to increase the longevity of the intervention's effects. This research will utilize a randomized controlled trial design with 360 inner-city AA men 18 to 45 years who report recent unprotected vaginal or anal intercourse with a woman. Men will be randomly allocated to one of two small-group interventions specially designed for AA men: (a) a HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention or (b) a health promotion control intervention on healthful diet and physical activity. To evaluate a strategy to increase the longevity of intervention effects, the men also will be randomized to receive or not receive individually tailored mailings to reinforce the intervention's message. The approach draws on social cognitive theory, the theory of planned behavior, and the applicant's Preliminary Studies with AA men. The primary outcome is self-reported consistent condom use during vaginal and heterosexual anal intercourse in the previous 3 months collected at baseline and 6 and 12 months post-intervention via audio-computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI). Secondary outcomes include other sexual behaviors and theoretical variables hypothesized to mediate intervention efficacy. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) and random effects models will be employed to address the Specific Aims.               RELEVANCE: This research may provide an urgently needed intervention to reduce the risk of STDs, including HIV, in African American men, one of the highest risk populations in the US. Moreover, African American women have 20 times the rate of HIV seen in White women, with over 75% of the cases are tied to sexual relations with men. However, few trials have tested gender-specific HIV/STD risk-reduction interventions for heterosexually active men.",Reducing Risk of HIV/STD Infection Among African American Men,8197500,R01MD004075,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Mails ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Planning Theory ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' Woman ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Physical activity ', ' infectious disease transmission ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' disease transmission ', ' Native Americans ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Life ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Route ', ' behavior change ', ' Equation ', ' inner city ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' trial design ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' cost ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' high risk ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' consistent condom use ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2012,396000,0.00770674393320103

"PROMOTING UPTAKE OF A USUAL SOURCE OF CARE AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men experience disproportionately poorer health outcomes compared to most other demographic and racial groups. For example, compared to all other males, African American men have a higher incidence of uncontrolled hypertension, higher death rate from heart disease, and a higher incidence of most of the major cancers. They die on average 5 to 10 years earlier than men and women of most other racial and ethnic groups. One factor recognized as a contributor to these disparities is lack of a usual source of health care. Having a usual provider is particularly beneficial to the health of African American men because consistent providers can establish trust, provide regular preventive care, and better manage care on a long- term basis for improved outcomes. Yet public health interventions aimed at promoting a usual source of care among African American men have not been widely disseminated. One approach that has been used successfully in public health campaigns to influence different subgroups within a population is health marketing. The health marketing approach is a multi-step research strategy by which individuals comprising a given population (e.g., African American men) are meaningfully classified into distinct subgroups whose members share a constellation of characteristics relevant to a criterion (e.g., having a usual source of care). Using this strategy, health communications are custom tailored for each identified subgroup in a health- promoting intervention. The goals of the proposed study are (a) to apply health marketing strategies to identify and characterize distinctive subgroups of African American men with respect to having a usual source of care, and (b) to explore preferences within subgroups for message content and communication channels that will be most effective in promoting uptake of a usual source of care among these men. The research plan of the project consists of two phases. First, statistical classification techniques will be used to identiy specific subgroups of African American men according to relationships between selected predictor variables (e.g., medical mistrust, various facets of masculinity) and behaviors related to having a usual source of care. Second, focus groups will be formed from men in the identified subgroups in order to better understand factors associated with African American men's having a usual source of care and to explore preferences for health communications approaches that might be most informative and motivating within the different subgroups. Using this health marketing approach, health communications can then be custom tailored for each particular subgroup in a future health-promoting intervention. Results of the proposed study will enhance the success of future tailored interventions designed to increase the uptake of a usual source of healthcare among vulnerable African American men.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American men are less likely than most other demographic and racial groups to have a usual source of health care. Having a usual provider or site of care is important to the health of African American men because sustained continuity can result in increased trust, improved receipt of preventive care, and better health-related outcomes. This project aims to identify and characterize distinctive subgroups of African American men who do not have a usual source of care, and to explore preferences within subgroups for message content and communication channels that will be most effective in promoting uptake of a usual source of care among these men.              African American men are less likely than most other demographic and racial groups to have a usual source of health care.

"Health-Seeking Behaviors among Men with Criminal Justice and Substance Abuse Hist The proposed training program will focus on cancer risks, screening behaviors and preventive health care among men returning to the community after incarceration. Individuals who have extensive criminal justice histories have disproportionately high rates of smoking, greater burden of viral infections associated with cancer (e.g., hepatitis, HPV, HIV) and greater barriers to establishing and obtaining routine health care. Although efforts are underway to connect people to health care settings upon release, there is an absence of evidence about men's health-seeking behaviors after returning to the community. Little is known about men's motivations and intentions to participate in screening, prevention or treatment, or about contextual factors that affect their health behavior.    A five year research and training program is proposed to prepare the principal investigator for a career in cancer-health disparities and participatory health services research focused on socially-marginalized, at-risk groups, such as former prisoners. The candidate's long-term goals are to advance her skills in community-partnered research, research design and psychometric development of measures. This program will build upon her strong background in HIV/AIDS, community practice and qualitative research, by providing a deeper understanding of factors that foster cancer-related health disparities among men with histories of criminal justice and substance abuse problems. Specific training objectives are: 1) to become proficient in the development, design, and use of psychometrically-sound instruments to measure health-seeking behavior among high-risk, socioeconomically disadvantaged men; 2) to gain experience with participatory research methods, in order to maximize former offenders' involvement in research and engagement in interventions to increase their use of needed health services; 3) to learn about the design of multilevel health services interventions, in order to create a program focusing on ethnic minority men with extensive criminal justice and substance abuse histories, and; 4) to develop an understanding of the ethical issues that enter into health services research among people recently released from the criminal justice system.    Structured training activities involve coursework in methodology, psychometrics/scale development, biostatistics, epidemiology, bioethics, advanced data analysis, and correctional health research. Mentors and advisors will provide additional readings, research supervision and consultation. The research and training activities will be pursued through the Division of Community Collaboration and Implementation Science in the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine with senior researchers in a number of institutions including Columbia University and the University of Michigan. This training will provide an important foundation for collaborative planning of evidence-based community health services for this population.    The proposed research will examine the health-related needs and health-seeking behaviors of 300 men ages 35-64 that have criminal justice and substance abuse histories in New York City. Specific aims are: 1) to explore unmet health and psychosocial needs and quality of life among ethnic minority men who have extensive criminal justice and substance histories; 2) to assess health-seeking behaviors among these men, including influences on their decisions to participate in cancer screening, prevention and treatment; 3) to describe contextual barriers and facilitators that affect men's use of services; and 4) to evaluate the reliability and validity of instruments developed or adapted for use with men with criminal justice and substance use histories. In addition to characterizing men's health concerns, this study will describe barriers and facilitators to seeking care and treatment as well as the complex set of circumstances (e.g. health/illness, parenting, vocational skills, housing stability, employment, and social support) that may impede men's ability to prioritize their health care needs.    Research and training activities described in this proposal are intended to develop the community connections, preliminary data and research skills necessary for the candidate to launch an independent program of community intervention research, designed to improve health and well-being and reduce cancer burden among vulnerable and largely disenfranchised segments of our society. Public Health Relevance. The proposed K01 Research Scientist Development Award title, ""Health Seeking among Men with Criminal Justice and Substance Abuse Histories"" has serious relevance to public health agenda and priorities. Of the 7.3 million adults who are under some form of correctional supervision (e.g., probation, parole, prison and jail inmates), ethnic minority men are four times as likely than whites and nearly 2.5 times as likely to be under correctional supervision[40]. Nationwide, many states are recognizing that chronic and infectious diseases are concentrated in correctional populations and the punitive responses to nonviolent offenders are no longer a viable, economical option. Once these men return to the community, men who have extensive  criminal justice and substance abuse histories often have unequal or lack access to health care services and fail to continue treatments that were initiated during incarceration[42]. Not only do ex-offenders report a wide array of problems and unmet health needs, but cancer-health disparities also exist. The proposed study contributes to the area of cancer-health disparities research and is consistent with NCI's strategic plan to chart the risk trajectories that may contribute to cancer and other adverse health  conditions among vulnerable and disadvantaged populations.",Health-Seeking Behaviors among Men with Criminal Justice and Substance Abuse Hist,8299804,K01CA154861,"['adulthood ', '

"Supporting Sexual Health Education by CBO-based Youth Development Professionals DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significance. In the United States, disproportionately high rates of sexually transmitted infection (STI) and unplanned pregnancy among adolescents suggest the continuing need for evidence-based sexuality education. Efforts to address sexual health through traditional educational venues, principally schools, play an important role in targeting this recalcitrant problem; however, there remains a substantial gap between current sexual health understanding, current epidemiological outcomes, and targeted objectives. Other emerging venues appear to offer an opportunity to increase delivery of accurate and appropriate sexual health information and educational activities. Moving beyond traditional educational providers, community-based organizations (CBOs) have been identified as venues with significant potential to promote adolescent sexual health. Within CBOs, youth development professionals (YDP) are important sources of sexuality education for adolescents; however, recent research documents a need for systematic training and accessible resources for YDP and indicates that the YDP themselves desire ongoing education and support. CBO-based YDP are called upon to conduct reactive sexual health education-to respond to questions. They also frequently participate in proactive efforts-conducting workshops and outreach. Moreover, they, and their organizations, have little support in doing so. Innovation. To address the unique opportunity afforded by CBO-based YDP, we propose to extend emerging research, conducted by members of our team, by examining roles CBO-based YDP play in sexual health education, counseling, and support. Based on the results of those research efforts, we will develop and validate a CBO implementation toolkit: a wide ranging set of resources to enhance effective CBO implementation of proactive and reactive sexual health education and counseling. The toolkit will address issues from organizational readiness to YDP education to materials and resources for provision to CBO clients and client- parents. Although the effort will make use of innovative media and technologies-including multimedia, interactivity, social networking, and smart phone compatible delivery-the emphasis, and innovation, is the specific health problem and the holistic, educationally and behaviorally sound, integrated, approach to this problem, with technologies as tools to augment adoption and implementation to the extent that the technologies are accessible by CBO's, the YDPs, and their clients, and where supportive of targeted outcomes. Phase I will extend current YDP research by using community-based participatory research methods with a national sample of YDP from a broad range of organizations, design the overall CBO toolkit, develop a subset of these educational and support tools, and test those materials formatively within single-subject usability sessions and in a summative field trial. Phase II will develop the entire suite of materials and conduct a large- scale trial to validate them prior to widespread dissemination. Our proposed effort will: Specific Aim 1. Improve upon what is known about the role of YDP as sexual health educators by examining their information and skills needs, their understanding of evidence-based sexual health for adolescents, and the sexual health program/intervention needs of their organizations (CBOs). Specific Aim 2. Improve sexual health efforts of CBO-based YDP by developing resources to address:  a. Reactive Education: Increase YDP efficacy for evidence-based responses to sexual health questions and increase YDP capacity to use behavioral change messages and interventions.  b. Proactive Education: Increase frequency, accuracy, and effectiveness of outreach and educational efforts by YDP; increase YDP awareness of selves as sexual health models.  c. Organizational Adoption: Enable CBOs, as organizations, to assess readiness, to assess effectiveness, and to develop a systematic approach to providing evidence-based sexual health programming. The proposed research effort will be an important contribution to the understanding of CBO-based YDP sexual health educational efforts and will also lead to the development and validation of innovative educational and performance support tools in an area where none currently exist.  Sexual health outcomes among adolescents remain problematic. Researchers, practitioners and public health officials have increasingly recognized the need to expand beyond traditional channels used to provide information and education related to sexual health in the United States. Community-based organizations (CBOs) have been identified as venues with significant potential to promote adolescent sexual health and support behavioral change and risk-reduction. Within CBOs, youth development professionals (YDP) are important sources of sexuality education for adolescents and have the potential to influence sexual decision- making and behavior. Often YDP have the ability to reach youth who may not be engaged through other efforts. Increasingly, YDP are called upon to provide sexual health information whether or not they have been prepared to do so; moreover, the often serve as sexual health role models, even when they do not overtly recognize this role. To do so accurately, efficiently, and effectively, both YDP, as individuals, and CBO, as organizations, need education and support resources for themselves and for the adolescents they serve. The proposed research effort will be an important contribution to the understanding of CBO-based YDP sexual health educational efforts and will lead to the development and validation of innovative educational and performance support tools in an area where none currently exist. The CBO tool kit will include web based courses for YDP and CBO administration; a range of support media (from paper to videos to games) for YDP to provide to clients; and organization small media, including posters, instructor led guides and media, and press releases for conducting outreach and workshops. There presently are no similar materials or products available, regardless of medium or quality. Given the large number of CBO and their documented need, the CBO Sexual Health Education Kits to be developed through Phase I and 2 of this effort should be commercially viable. CBO will be able roll out the materials, including staff courses and community workshops, in addition to the multimedia, video, and paper-based training and support components. Baldwin suggested that one of the single greatest barriers to YDP professional development is the lack of time to travel to sites for training, a barrier at leas partially surmountable by web- based courses. YDP engaged in the Fisher et al. research as well as others higher in the organizations have expressed interest in such efforts, especially one that would enable them to provide input into the final package to be adopted by the particular organization, as our proposed inclusion of CBPR methods will do. In the end, sexual health among adolescents continues to be an area in which there remains significant room for improvement. CBO-based YDP are well-placed to improve sexual health outcomes, frequently encounter sexual health related questions from their adolescent clientele, generally feel uncomfortable and unprepared to answer such questions and, in part perhaps as a result of this lack of preparation and comfort, less frequently conduct proactive educational activity regarding sexual health as compared to all other health and personal topics for which CBO conduct outreach. Moreover, when asked about sexual health programming, most YDP initially believe they rarely engage in any non-reactive educational efforts, yet when Baldwin further discussed a broader conceptualization of sexual health with the YDP, including the role they play as models of sexual relationships, the YDP realized that they in fact were always already acting as sexual beings, including modeling both positive and negative sexual health and relationship behaviors and stereotypes. Making this status overt is a first step toward more effectively addressing sexual health in this setting. The proposed effort will address this problem through judiciously selected technologies chosen to enhance a theoretically sound and evidence-based approach to organizational adoption, YDP education, and youth sexual health understanding and behavioral change. As such, the end result should not only provide a meaningful contribution to the related literatures but should also result in a product that is well-received by community based organizations and other groups with similar needs to engage in proactive and reactive sexual health counseling and education.             ",Supporting Sexual Health Education by CBO-based Youth Development Professionals,8314995,R43HD070522,"['Behavior ', ' Adoption ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Professional Education ', ' Educational Activities ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Decision Making ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Client ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Organization and Administration ', ' Methods ', ' Paper ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Non-Profit Organizations ', ' Nonprofit Organizations ', ' Literature ', ' Schools ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Technology ', ' Stereotyped Behavior ', ' sound ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Risk ', ' Research ', ' Recommendation ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Parents ', ' base ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Phase ', ' Social Network ', ' Unplanned pregnancy ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' improved ', ' role model ', ' Training Support ', ' Travel ', ' Time ', ' Sexuality ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' United States ', ' Testing ', ' interest ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Press Releases ', ' Source ', ' Services ', ' instructor ', ' Surgeon ', ' tool ', ' Adopted ', ' programs ', ' Multimedium ', ' Multimedia ', ' posters ', ' Area ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Individual ', ' Training ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Site ', ' self knowledge ', ' self awareness ', ' Self view ', ' Self image ', ' Personal awareness ', ' Self Perception ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' outreach ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' social ', ' Effectiveness ', ' member ', ' Performance ', ' skills ', ' intervention program ', ' Preparation ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' sexual relationship ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Validation ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Health Educators ', ' Sexual Health ', ' community based participatory research ', ' usability ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Population ', ' community organizations ', ' Outcome ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NICHD,"ACADEMIC EDGE, INC.",R43,2012,198446,0.014061677985835996
"Spouses' Health at Midlife and Wife Breadwinning Dynamics Across the Life Course     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project we examine the relationship between marital income dynamics (wives' higher earnings, in particular) and the mental and physical health of husbands and wives at midlife (51- 61 years old) using a life course of administrative earnings data and longitudinal latent class analyses. This is a demographically critical issue because wives are increasingly likely to be the primary earner. For example, 22% of wives earned more than their husbands in 2007, compared to only 4% in 1970. Further, wives' higher earnings destabilize traditional ideas of men as breadwinners and have consequently been linked with poorer physical and mental health for husbands of wife breadwinners. However, most prior research focuses only on men and relies on short-term snapshots of wives' higher earnings contributions (i.e., one to three year periods), despite recent evidence that wives' higher earnings are unstable and fluctuate widely over the life course. These gaps leave many unresolved questions about the relationship between wives' higher earnings and the health of married men and women. We address these unresolved questions by conducting longitudinal latent class and regression analyses of 30 years (1962-1991) of couple-level Social Security Administration earnings data from one cohort of the Health and Retirement Study (couples born between 1931 and 1941). We link these couple- level life course earnings data to husbands' and wives' physical and mental health in 1992 (when the sample is 51 to 61 years old). Specifically, we propose to: 1) identify life course dynamics of wives' higher earnings (i.e., length, frequency, transitions into/out of, and life course stage of wives' higher earnings) that may relate to mental and physical health at midlife; 2) examine how these dynamics of wives' higher earnings differentially relate to men's and women's health at midlife; and 3) explore how these documented health relationships are confounded by covariates including demographics, education, and low marital income and/or are caused by health selection as measured by childhood health. This research will be the first to identify distinct and varied patterns of wife breadwinning across a near life course of earnings. Linking these latent class patterns of wife breadwinning to midlife health can illuminate an under-studied correlate of poorer health among aging married couples and a potential cause of gendered health differences within marriage, thereby making important contributions to scholarship on the SES gradient in health, income and health in marriage, and gender differences in health.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will advance scholarship on the SES gradient in health, on marital income and health, and on gendered health differences for aging men and women. The findings from this research can be used by public health and medical practitioners to develop psychosocial interventions for families adjusting to the changing economics of marriage.                  The proposed project will advance scholarship on the SES gradient in health, on marital income and health, and on gendered health differences for aging men and women.

"Development and Testing of a Syndemic Model among Gay and Bisexual Male Adolescen    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The training goal of this career development grant is to become an independent scientific investigator contributing to the understanding of the social processes through which gay and bisexual male adolescents and emerging adults (GBMAEA) develop a range of health disparities, including HIV/AIDS, depression, and substance use. These processes require investigation in order to inform the development of multilevel and structural interventions to eliminate these disparities. In order to achieve these goals, I propose to develop and apply skills in the areas of adolescent development, psychosocial scale development and validation, latent class analysis and mixed models. Dr. Gary Harper will oversee my professional development under this proposal. In addition to supervising my progress through the proposed research and training plan, Dr. Harper will supervise my training in two areas of skill development: qualitative data analysis methods and adolescent development theories and applications. Dr. Isa Fernandez will act as a co-mentor and senior methodologist working with me on secondary data analysis, sampling and recruitment methods and supervision of my grantsmanship and R01 proposal development. Dr. Richard Campbell will act as a co-mentor and supervise my training in statistical methods, including psychosocial scale validation, item response analysis, latent class analysis, and mixed models. Dr. Ron Stall will act as a co- mentor and supervise my training in developing and testing a model of syndemic production of HIV/AIDS and health disparities. The goal of the proposed research is to empirically test a model of syndemic production of negative health outcomes among GBMAEA, and to investigate possible resiliencies among this population that are associated with positive health outcomes. I will assess (a) how these male adolescents and emerging adults perceive, experience and internalize gay-related stigma, (b) how sexual identity development is correlated with the perception, experience, and internalization of gay-related stigma, (c) to what degree these stigma processes and sexual identity development are associated to a range of health risk indicators, and (d) to what degree perceived social support moderates the effects of stigma and sexual identity development on health behaviors. This application supports the mission of the National Institute of Mental Health by producing data on sexual identity development trajectories, gay-related stigma, and health behaviors of GBMAEA that will help inform the development of theoretically sound multi-level and structural interventions in the future to address HIV/AIDS and health disparities among this population.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In the U.S., men who have sex with men are affected by marked health disparities, including elevated rates of HIV infection, substance use, and depression, that may be syndemically produced as responses to marginalization during adolescence. The research component of this career development grant will develop and test a syndemic model among gay and bisexual male adolescents and emerging adults (GBMAEA). This application supports the mission of the National Institute of Mental Health by producing data on sexual identity development trajectories, gay-related stigma, and health behaviors of GBMAEA that will help inform the development of theoretically sound multi-level and structural interventions in the future to address HIV/AIDS and health disparities among this population.

"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Fall Risk and Bone Strength Among Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The changing shape of the U.S. population age structure will dramatically increase the number of osteoporotic fractures in the elderly; the increase will disproportionately affect minorities and men. It is therefore important to understand the epidemiology of osteoporosis in these populations. While there are clear racial/ethnic differences in fracture rates, their origins are not understood. The proposed study will be a comprehensive effort to further our understanding of the fundamental causes of racial/ethnic disparities in fracture rates by focusing on markers of two primary `upstream' determinants of fracture: falls and bone fragility. The Boston Area Community Health/Bone (BACH/Bone) Survey is a study of skeletal health in a randomly selected group of 1,219 black, Hispanic, and white men between 29-80 y. BACH/Bone staff have been very productive, producing over 10 papers for peer-reviewed journals. We propose a second wave of data collection on ~825 men to begin ~6.5 y after baseline, when the cohort will be between 35-86 y. The Specific Aims of the proposed study are to, in a racially/ethnically diverse, population-based sample of men: 1) Estimate longitudinal changes in markers of bone strength and fall risk, with and without adjustment for known risk factors; 2) Determine the relative contributions of social factors, individual risk behaviors and health status, and physiological influences to racial/ethnic differences in markers of fall risk and bone strength; 3) Establish the first age- and racial/ethnic group-specific, population-based estimates of bone microarchitecture, and identify determinants of observed age and racial/ethnic differences; 4) Determine whether there are age and racial/ethnic differences in the ratio of bone loads to bone strength (the `factor of risk'); 5) Examine whether genetic ancestry contributes to variations in markers of fall risk and bone strength beyond that attributable to self-identified race/ethnicity. The representativeness and racial/ethnic diversity of the BACH/Bone cohort are unique, and, as such, the potential impact of the study is enormous. By focusing upstream on markers of fall risk and bone strength with state-of-the-art measures, it will make landmark contributions to our understanding of the elusive mechanisms underlying racial/ethnic differences in bone fragility. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Boston Area Community Health/Bone Survey is an observational research study examining the complex relationships between aging, social structure, health and lifestyle, hormones, genetic factors, and markers of fall risk as well as bone strength in a population-based sample of racially/ethnically diverse aging men. Findings will continue to inform our understanding of bone fragility, bone loss, and osteoporosis.               7.

"Aging, Stress & Health among Gay-Identified Men: Linking Past and Present     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The AIDS epidemic and the growing social enfranchisement of sexual minorities over the past three to four decades has had a profound impact on the lives of the current cohort of midlife and older gay-identified men (hereinafter, gay men), yet little is known about how the general health status of these men has developed over this time. The proposed exploratory study (a) will analyze 27 years of health and psychosocial data from an existing sample of HIV- and HIV+ midlife and older gay men (b) in conjunction with new data from this sample to be collected with the ""Aging, Stress, and Health among Gay Men"" (ASH-GM) survey. The sample is the original cohort of the Los Angeles (LA) site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS, current N = 400; mean age=57, range=43-79). Begun in 1984, the MACS are one of the longest running natural history studies of HIV/AIDS. These data are especially valuable because multiple biopsychosocial domains have been measured biannually since the study's inception, providing a unique data repository that serves as the foundation for innovatively studying aging processes among gay men from a life course perspective. We propose to further develop and test a novel ""life course and sexual minority aging stress model"", integrating (I) the life course perspective (e.g., trajectories, transition, turning points); (ii) the general stress process model (e.g., financial strain, psychosocial resources); (iii) the minority stress model (e.g., stigmatization); and (iv) aging-related stressor (e.g., independence concerns). A key feature of this conceptual model is the intersection of history with individual biography. The life course concept of trajectories will be operationalized as a latent class mixture model to create clusters of similar trajectories with the 27 years of longitudinal data for two prototypes: health (depressive symptoms, cardiovascular disease) and psychosocial resources (having a confidant). The test of the theoretical model first examines the impact of the types of stressors listed above with current health status, along with the mediating and moderating role of psychosocial resources. This conventional approach is then innovatively elaborated by examining the main and interactive effects of the trajectories to test whether the impact of current conditions on health is conditional upon the past. Due to the dearth of longitudinal data on sexual minorities, research using a life course perspective to study aging among this population will necessarily rely on retrospective data. We will innovatively evaluate such retrospective reports by exploiting the longitudinal design of the MACS to compare reports made at the time to new retrospective reports of the same constructs collected with the ASH-GM. Our specific aims are to: (1) design and implement the ASH-GM; (2) analyze 27-year trajectories with existing MACS-LA data; (3) test the novel theoretical model using both sets of data; and 4) evaluate the use of retrospective reports to study the life course of midlife and olde gay men. Findings will be informative to emergent research on aging among these men, and will provide preliminary data for an RO1 application that will longitudinally expand this exploratory study to all four MACS sites.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The population of midlife and older gay men is increasing exponentially as the baby boomer generation comes of age.

"Social-Structural Stressors, Resilience and Sexual Risk Behaviors Among Black Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to exact a severe toll on Black men in the U.S. Although they represent just 14% of the male population, Black men accounted for 47% of HIV cases among men in 2009. The association between disproportionately high rates of HIV/AIDS in Black communities and social-structural factors such as poverty, neighborhood instability, and incarceration are well documented. Despite increasing advocacy for more social-structural approaches to HIV prevention however, considerable gaps in knowledge exist about how social structural stressors at the population-level and sociodemographic stressors at the individual-level (e.g., individual socioeconomic status, perceptions of racial discrimination) are associated with Black men's sexual HIV risk behaviors. There is also a dearth of knowledge about how resilience at both the neighborhood and individual-level may protect against Black men's sexual HIV risk behaviors. We propose a 5-year cross-sectional multiphase mixed methods study in Philadelphia, PA, in which we use geospatial analysis, qualitative methods, and multilevel quantitative modeling to refine and test a conceptual model of neighborhood-level social-structural stressors, individual-level sociodemographic stressors, psychological risk factors, neighborhood-level and individual-level resilience, and Black men's sexual HIV risk and protective behaviors. The study has 3 phases. Phase I includes focus groups to explore neighborhood-level social- structural stressors and resilience and to inform spatial data analyses of social-structural stressors (e.g., neighborhood poverty, neighborhood instability, crime) that may be associated with Black men's sexual HIV risk behaviors. Phase II involves the multilevel modeling of social-structural and sociodemographic stressors (e.g., individual SES), psychological risk factors, resilience, and sexual HIV risk and protective behaviors with a probability sample of 700 Black men between the ages of 18 and 44, of all sexual orientations, recruited from 100 Census block-groups. Phase III involves the integration of the study's results with spatial data visualization and culturally grounded explanations based on interviews with 30 Black men, followed by focus groups to confirm the study's interpretations. The expected outcome of this innovative study is that it will guide the development of structural interventions to reduce HIV incidence in Black men and their sexual partners regardless of the partners' gender. The overall positive impact of the research is that it will advance empirical knowledge about the multilevel social-structural stressors and resilience of Black men's lives with implications for reducing HIV incidence and other health disparities prevalent among Black men. The proposed study is highly responsive to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy's stated goals of reducing HIV incidence in Black men and women.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS among Black men makes the development of innovative HIV prevention research that can inform structural interventions for this population, a top public health priority.

"Syndemic Production among Emergent Adult Men  PROJECT SUMMARY: Recent trends in U.S. urban centers indicate a rise in the number of new HIV infections in the population of young men who have sex with men (YMSM). These trends suggest a high level of vulnerability to HIV seroconversion in YMSM through sexual behavior as they emerge into adulthood. In addition, acts of sexual risk taking in this population often function synergistically with illicit drug use, and mental health burden. Despite some success with HIV prevention in the MSM population during the last 25 years, these recent patterns suggest that a reexamination of our prevention strategies for this population, especially for YMSM of color, is needed. Given the interplay that exists between unprotected sexual behavior, illicit drug use, and mental health burden, all such efforts must consider how these overlapping epidemics (also known as syndemics) fuel each other in a cohort of YMSM as they emerge into adulthood. Thus, we will we will initiate a prospective longitudinal program of research to follow the development of syndemics in a racially/ethnically and economically diverse cohort of urban HIV-negative YMSM in New York City as they transition from adolescence into young adulthood, and apply, test, and further develop a theory of syndemic production to understand the development of both maladaptive and adaptive behavioral outcomes. Specifically we seek to (1) develop and test theoretically informed measurement models of the covariance of illicit drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and mental health burden among emergent adult HIV-negative YMSM within and across time, (2) assess whether patterns of behavior are continuous, discontinuous, or some combination of both; (3) delineate the risk and protective bases-physical factors (i.e., pubertal onset, HIV status), relational factors (i.e., family history of psychopathology, current romantic relationships, peer support, and characteristics of residential, social, and sex neighborhoods), and psychosocial factors (i.e., sexual identity, internalized homophobia, hypermasculinity, racial identity, racial devaluation, HIV optimism) that predict the development of syndemics, and (4) determine the extent to which the development of syndemics varies by race/ethnicity, social class, and homelessness/housing stability in a cohort of HIV-negative YMSM. Using multiple measurement modalities, which include biological assays, calendar based methods, and self-reports, we will follow the development of 675, 18-year-old HIV-negative YMSM. Participants will be recruited through venue-based and respondent driven sampling, as they emerge into adulthood, over seven waves of data collection within a 36-month time frame. We will utilize Structural Equation and Latent Growth Curve Analysis to answer our four main research questions.  RELEVANCE The goal of this project is to understand why a new generation of young men who have sex with other men place themselves at risk for HIV transmission. Knowledge which we will generate will help us understand how these young men emerge into adulthood, the choices they make about sexual behavior and illicit drug use, as well as how these two behaviors interact with their mental health. We seek to understand why some men exhibit risky behaviors as they emerge into adulthood while others do not. Working with community and municipal partners, we will draw from what we have learned from both groups to develop strategies for HIV prevention and intervention that are relevant to this current and developing generation who did not live through the devastation of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980's. In addition, we will add to the methodological literature based on our analysis of nested latent growth curve models.",Syndemic Production among Emergent Adult Men,8471417,R01DA025537,"['Accounting ',

"Health Promotion for Positives: A Randomized Trial with HIV Positive Black Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to RFA-MD-12-001, ""NIMHD Health Disparities Research (R01)."" African American men who are infected with HIV are living longer and are being impacted by the same chronic diseases that affect the general population of African American men over 40.  To be sure, African American men, in general, have disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, and cancer, particularly prostate and colon cancer.  However, HIV infection is associated with an increased risk for co-morbidity from chronic diseases.  This increased risk is heightened by HIV infection, but also its treatment with certain agents used in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) combinations.  Many of these chronic illnesses have behavioral components-risk is influenced by what people do and do not do, their diet, and the amount of physical activity they get.  Although the high risk for multiple behavior-linked chronic diseases among HIV-positive individuals has been recognized, there is a lack of evidence-based intervention specifically tailored to their needs. Hence, the broad objective is to reduce the risk of chronic diseases among HIV positive African American men.  The Specific Aims are to test the efficacy of a theory- based, contextually appropriate health promotion intervention in inducing positive changes in behaviors linked  to risk of chronic diseases among HIV positive African American men age 40 years or older and to identify the  theoretical variables that mediate its efficacy.  The study will utilize a randomized controlled trial.  The participants willbe 384 African American HIV positive men age 40 or older who are receiving HAART for HIV.   The men will be randomized to a theory-based contextually appropriate health promotion intervention that involves three, 3-hour weekly intervention sessions or an attention-control group.  The health promotion intervention will be an adaptation of an intervention based on social cognitive theory integrated with formative research and found to be efficacious in increasing adherence to 5-a-Day diet and physical activity guidelines and prostate cancer screening guidelines in the applicants' preliminary studies.  Data will be collected at  baseline, immediately post, 3, 6 and 12 months post intervention, which will permit assessment of the short- term and long-term effects of the intervention and whether the intervention's efficacy varies over time.  Audio computer-assisted self-interviewing will be used to assess self-reported adherence to physical activity guidelines, 5-a-Day fruit and vegetable guidelines, prostate screening guidelines, and colon cancer screening guidelines and theoretical mediators of behavior change.  Objective outcomes will include health-related fitness (6-minute walk test, 1-minute push-up test, 1-minute sit-up test, sit-and-reach test), physiological variables (blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-hip ratio), and prostate and colon cancer screening based on medical record review.                   8.  PROJECT NARRATIVE     Highly activity antiretroviral treatment (HAART) for HIV has caused dramatic decreases in HIV-related  opportunistic infections and mortality~ hence, people are living longer with HIV.  Aging is associated with  increased risk of chronic diseases, but HIV infection and HAART also heighten these risks.  Even in the  absence of HIV, African American men are at disproportionately high risk for chronic disease morbidity and  mortality.  This research, then, responds to the urgent need for interventions to reduce the risk of non-HIV  related chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes in HIV positive African  American men age 40 and older.

"Relationship Disruption during Incarceration and HIV Risk in African American Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men released from prison face disproportionate HIV risk. Preventing HIV sexual risk behavior and drug use in this group is critical to reducing the race disparity in HIV. However, research on the factors that drive and protect against HIV risk among African American male releasees is limited. Returning to a committed partner after release may be an important protective factor against HIV risk among African American male releasees during reentry. However, incarceration destabilizes committed relationships. Though 50-80% of men enter prison in a committed relationship, we estimate that half of these relationships end by the time of release. Upon release, loss of a partner may lead men to seek multiple, new partners to meet companionship needs or may lead to distress and, in turn, self-medication with drugs or sex. No prior study has evaluated the degree to which partner loss during incarceration influences post-release HIV risk. The present mixed method study is designed to address this gap in the current field of HIV prevention science. This study seeks to examine the hypothesis that dissolution of stable intimate relationships during incarceration elevates sexual risk behavior and drug use among inmates upon their release. The specific aims are: Primary Quantitative Aims: Aim 1. Among African American men in relationships at the time of prison entry, to describe the associations between dissolution of relationships during incarceration and HIV sexual risk behavior (unprotected sex; multiple sex partnerships; buying sex for money or drugs) and drug use (crack use; binge drinking). Aim 2. To assess whether diminished mental health (low coping; increased depression; increased anxiety) due to dissolution of relationships during incarceration results in HIV sexual risk behavior and drug use. Aim 3. To evaluate whether the association between dissolution of relationships during incarceration and HIV sexual risk behavior and drug use varies by respondent and relationship characteristics. Qualitative Aim: To qualitatively explore the social context of post-release and men's perceptions of the factors and processes driving post-release sexual risk behavior and drug use. To accomplish these study aims, we propose to recruit 400 African American male inmates who are scheduled to be released from prison and who were in stable intimate heterosexual relationships at the time of prison entry. Our pilot work suggests that ~50% of relationships will have ended during the incarceration. We will follow men after their release to assess whether post-release sexual risk behavior and drug use are higher among men whose relationships ended during incarceration versus men whose relationships remained intact. The proposed study is designed to inform development of policies and interventions that minimize the destabilizing effects of criminal justice involvement on relationships and health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Since more than 800,000 African American men are incarcerated in prison at any given time, and hundreds of thousands return home to their communities each year, policies and programs that are effective in reducing HIV risk in this group would prevent substantial numbers of new infections among African American men and members of their sexual networks annually. This research will determine whether dissolution of committed relationships during incarceration is a risk factor for post-release HIV sexual risk behavior and drug use among African American male releasees and will describe the pathways through which relationship dissolution may work to influence HIV risk. Study findings may highlight the need for implementation of criminal justice policies that reduce network disruption and may inform HIV prevention interventions, including in-prison programs for inmates and their partners that foster communication and prevent relationship dissolution, and pre-release HIV prevention education for men who have lost a committed partner during incarceration.

"A Brief, Clinic-Based, HIV Prevention Program for African American Teen Males    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has declared that AIDS is a ""state of emergency"" in the US relative to African Americans. Teen males attending STD clinics are one important, yet often neglected, population of African Americans at risk of HIV acquisition. Despite extremely high rates of STD acquisition (and subsequent infection) among this population, effective clinic-based interventions specifically designed to reduce their sexual risk behavior for STD/HIV have not been developed/disseminated. A recent intervention trial (conducted by Dr. Crosby) demonstrated the efficacy of a brief, clinic-based, intervention designed to prevent subsequent STI acquisition among African American males 18 to 29 years of age. The proposed study will test the efficacy this intervention (in modified form) to reduce STI incidence among African American teen (15 to 20 years old). The primary hypothesis is that teens randomized to receive the intervention will have a lower incidence rate of laboratory-confirmed STIs at 2 and 6-month follow-up assessments (as well as 12-month follow-up conducted by a medical records review) compared to those receiving an attention-equivalent control condition. Teens (N = 840) will be recruited from a publicly-funded STD clinic located in an urban area of the South. After completing an A-CASI assessment, teens will be rated on their ability to apply condoms to a penile model and then asked to donate a urine specimen for STI testing. Specimens will be tested for C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and T. Vaginalis using nucleic acid amplification assays. Randomization will then be achieved by a concealment of allocation technique. Teens will be randomized to immediately receive: 1) a brief (60 minute) theory-based, one-on-one, interactive intervention delivered by a lay health advisor or 2) an attention equivalent control condition. The assessment battery will be repeated 2 months subsequent to enrollment and again 6 months after enrollment. A medical records review will be conducted 12 months after enrollment to compare clinic reported incidence rates between the randomized groups of teens. If incidence of STIs in this population of teens can be decreased as substantially as was found in the previous study of 18 to 29 year-old African American males (percent relative difference = 36.7), the public health significance for African American teen males will substantially contribute to rectify the racial disparity in HIV/STD experienced by African American teen males. By extension, we suggest that their partners (typically African American teen females) will also benefit. Because our program is designed for ease of implementation, the number of dissemination and translation issues will be greatly minimized thereby greatly facilitating the process of translating research into practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed efficacy trial tests an innovative method of bridging the gap between research and practice. By providing a brief, clinic-based, HIV/STD prevention program to African American teen males attending an STD clinic, the study will be the first to demonstrate that teen's sexual risk behavior can be reduced without excessive time and resources. The focus on African American teen males is also quite timely given the recent declaration by CDC that AIDS is a ""state of emergency"" for African Americans.

"Women's Empowerment and Sexual Risk in Zambia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed pre-doctoral fellowship project will examine the relationship of women's relative empowerment and its impact on women's risk of HIV/STD. Empowerment interventions with women have become one of the major approaches to women's sexual risk reduction, yet the empirical evidence of its impact in reducing sexual risk is limited. One critique is that empowerment programs are focused on women as individuals rather than taking into account their male, familial and community relationships. This proposed research seeks to test the widely accepted proposition that interventions that focus on empowerment are effective in reducing Zambian women's sexual risk. It also seeks to identify the nature of the relationship with women's primary male partner as a factor in both empowerment and sexual risk. Zambia is experiencing the health, economic, and social impacts of a mature HIV/AIDS epidemic, with a HIV prevalence of 14.3% for individuals between the ages of 15 and 49. The epidemic has affected all aspects of the social and economic growth and has devastated individual families, weakened all areas of the public sector, and threatened the long-term national development. Hence the need to minimize sexual risk and curb the spread of the epidemic is pressing. The specific aims of this project are to: develop a local definition of women's empowerment, document the empowerment programs available to residents in the Kanyama township (Lusaka, Zambia), identify the range of variation in women's primary relationships with men, identify the level of exposure to intervention programs and its impact on both empowerment and sexual risk, assess the nature of women's partner relationship and its relationship to empowerment and sexual risk and conduct a multivariate analysis that identifies the relative strength of independent and mediating variables in predicting women's sexual risk. The project will employ both qualitative (key informant and in-depth interviewing) and quantitative (survey instrument) methods. This project is intended to provide the formative research results needed for the development of an expanded research grant by the applicant after her PhD is awarded; to contribute to available research on the role of empowerment in sexual risk reduction; and to generate data that can positively impact on the health and well being of women in Zambia. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed pre-doctoral fellowship project will examine the relationship of women's relative empowerment and its impact on women's risk of HIV/STD. It also seeks to identify the nature of the relationship with women's primary male partner as a factor in both empowerment and sexual risk. By evaluating the effects of these two factors on women's sexual health outcomes, insight will be provided towards the design of culturally relevant interventions that will effectively reduce women's sexual risk.",Women's Empowerment and Sexual Risk in Zambia,8263042,F31MH094143,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Critiques ', ' Data Collection ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Extended Family ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Female ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' Marriage ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Persons ', ' Public Sector ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' UNFPA ', ' UNICEF ', ' USAID ', ' Woman ', ' Northern Rhodesia ', ' Zambia ', ' Gender ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Mediating ', ' Social Impacts ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Sahara ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Review Literature ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Country ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' empowerment ', ' member ', ' Social status ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' health economics ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' Natural experiment ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' young man ', ' young woman ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,F31,2012,27168,0.07127551519226638
"Syndemic Development and HIV Risk Among Vulnerable Young Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the number of new HIV infections has been relatively stable since late 1990s, the face of the infection has changed. Half of all new infections now occur among youth and substantial disparities exist based on sexual orientation. Recent data from the National HIV/AIDS Reporting System indicate that male-to-male sexual contact accounts for 76-79% of HIV diagnoses among 16-19 year old males, although less is known about the actual prevalence of HIV and related health issues in this population. Disparities also exist in preparedness to prevent HIV among young men who have sex with men (YMSM), with no proven intervention for adolescents in this vulnerable group. The epidemic of HIV among YMSM does not exist in a vacuum. Instead, YMSM experience multiple psychosocial health disparities, including elevated rates of illicit drug use, exposure to violence, and mental health problems such as suicidality. Recent evidence indicates that these health issues represent intertwined epidemics that each contribute to HIV risk among YMSM, a situation referred to as a syndemic. Building on our own research with YMSM, as well as other high risk youth, we are proposing to investigate a syndemic of psychosocial health issues linked to HIV among YMSM ages 16-20. This syndemic includes HIV risk, drug use, internalizing mental health problems, and violence exposure. The overarching goals of this study are twofold: 1) to provide much-needed epidemiological data on the prevalence of HIV and related health issues in order to inform public health priorities; and 2) to collect vital information on risk and protective factors to inform the development of an intervention targeting this vulnerable population. We will accomplish these goals with three primary specific aims: (1) Ascertain the prevalence and clustering of a syndemic of biopsychosocial health problems among YMSM. We will: (a) Recruit a representative sample of 450 ethnically diverse YMSM using Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS); (b) Assess the syndemic components using state-of-the-art approaches; (c) Use the RDS model to calculate unbiased estimators of the prevalence of syndemic components; (d) Test for the clustering of syndemic components. (2) Characterize multiple trajectories of syndemic development by following our YMSM sample longitudinally over a two year period. We will: (a) Assess youth every 6 months during the transition from late adolescence to emerging adulthood, to explore the natural history of syndemic development. (b) Use growth-mixture modeling to characterize groups of youth with different trajectory classes of syndemic development in order to allow for early identification of youth most at risk of HIV acquisition. (3) Determine the importance of YMSM-specific factors in syndemic development so as to guide the development of culturally-relevant HIV prevention interventions for our target population. We will: (a) Test the value of YMSM-specific factors as predictors of trajectory class; (b) Test the incremental value of our theoretical syndemic model for predicting HIV-related sexual risk relative to the IMB model. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) are at elevated risk for a syndemic of biopsychosocial health problems. This syndemic includes HIV risk, substance use, internalizing mental health problems, and violence exposure. The overarching goal of this study is to collect information on YMSM-specific risk and protective factors, which can then be used to inform the development of an intervention targeting this vulnerable population.

"Health-Seeking Behaviors among Men with Criminal Justice and Substance Abuse Hist The proposed training program will focus on cancer risks, screening behaviors and preventive health care among men returning to the community after incarceration. Individuals who have extensive criminal justice histories have disproportionately high rates of smoking, greater burden of viral infections associated with cancer (e.g., hepatitis, HPV, HIV) and greater barriers to establishing and obtaining routine health care. Although efforts are underway to connect people to health care settings upon release, there is an absence of evidence about men's health-seeking behaviors after returning to the community. Little is known about men's motivations and intentions to participate in screening, prevention or treatment, or about contextual factors that affect their health behavior.    A five year research and training program is proposed to prepare the principal investigator for a career in cancer-health disparities and participatory health services research focused on socially-marginalized, at-risk groups, such as former prisoners. The candidate's long-term goals are to advance her skills in community-partnered research, research design and psychometric development of measures. This program will build upon her strong background in HIV/AIDS, community practice and qualitative research, by providing a deeper understanding of factors that foster cancer-related health disparities among men with histories of criminal justice and substance abuse problems. Specific training objectives are: 1) to become proficient in the development, design, and use of psychometrically-sound instruments to measure health-seeking behavior among high-risk, socioeconomically disadvantaged men; 2) to gain experience with participatory research methods, in order to maximize former offenders' involvement in research and engagement in interventions to increase their use of needed health services; 3) to learn about the design of multilevel health services interventions, in order to create a program focusing on ethnic minority men with extensive criminal justice and substance abuse histories, and; 4) to develop an understanding of the ethical issues that enter into health services research among people recently released from the criminal justice system.    Structured training activities involve coursework in methodology, psychometrics/scale development, biostatistics, epidemiology, bioethics, advanced data analysis, and correctional health research. Mentors and advisors will provide additional readings, research supervision and consultation. The research and training activities will be pursued through the Division of Community Collaboration and Implementation Science in the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine with senior researchers in a number of institutions including Columbia University and the University of Michigan. This training will provide an important foundation for collaborative planning of evidence-based community health services for this population.    The proposed research will examine the health-related needs and health-seeking behaviors of 300 men ages 35-64 that have criminal justice and substance abuse histories in New York City. Specific aims are: 1) to explore unmet health and psychosocial needs and quality of life among ethnic minority men who have extensive criminal justice and substance histories; 2) to assess health-seeking behaviors among these men, including influences on their decisions to participate in cancer screening, prevention and treatment; 3) to describe contextual barriers and facilitators that affect men's use of services; and 4) to evaluate the reliability and validity of instruments developed or adapted for use with men with criminal justice and substance use histories. In addition to characterizing men's health concerns, this study will describe barriers and facilitators to seeking care and treatment as well as the complex set of circumstances (e.g. health/illness, parenting, vocational skills, housing stability, employment, and social support) that may impede men's ability to prioritize their health care needs.    Research and training activities described in this proposal are intended to develop the community connections, preliminary data and research skills necessary for the candidate to launch an independent program of community intervention research, designed to improve health and well-being and reduce cancer burden among vulnerable and largely disenfranchised segments of our society. Public Health Relevance. The proposed K01 Research Scientist Development Award title, ""Health Seeking among Men with Criminal Justice and Substance Abuse Histories"" has serious relevance to public health agenda and priorities. Of the 7.3 million adults who are under some form of correctional supervision (e.g., probation, parole, prison and jail inmates), ethnic minority men are four times as likely than whites and nearly 2.5 times as likely to be under correctional supervision[40]. Nationwide, many states are recognizing that chronic and infectious diseases are concentrated in correctional populations and the punitive responses to nonviolent offenders are no longer a viable, economical option. Once these men return to the community, men who have extensive  criminal justice and substance abuse histories often have unequal or lack access to health care services and fail to continue treatments that were initiated during incarceration[42]. Not only do ex-offenders report a wide array of problems and unmet health needs, but cancer-health disparities also exist. The proposed study contributes to the area of cancer-health disparities research and is consistent with NCI's strategic plan to chart the risk trajectories that may contribute to cancer and other adverse health  conditions among vulnerable and disadvantaged populations.",Health-Seeking Behaviors among Men with Criminal Justice and Substance Abuse Hist,8634230,K01CA154861,[''],NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2012,42190,-0.014243538544453135
"Social capital and HIV risk behavior among rural migrants in China    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Worldwide data suggest that migrants are at increased risk of HIV infection. The high rates of HIV infection and the mobility of migrant populations make migrants a living bridge to spread the AIDS virus between the countries/places of origin and the countries/places of destination. Research findings indicate that the increased HIV infection among migrants is associated their high prevalence of HIV risk behaviors (substance use and risky sex), which in turn, are determined by socioenvironmental and situational factors. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which environmental factors lead to HIV risk behavior. Guided by the Social Capital Theory, in this project, we propose to test two hypothesized mechanisms that may link social influences to HIV risk behavior among migrants - the lack of social support (including informational, instrumental and emotional) and the weakening of informal social control (including collective efficacy and normative beliefs). Rural migrants lost their social capital (defined as durable, resource-rich, trustworthy, and reciprocal network connections a person accumulated) deeply rooted in the place of rural origin and they may experience difficulties rebuilding social capital in the urban destination due to their low socioeconomic status. Migrants with limited social capital may then experience difficulties obtaining informational, instrumental, and emotional support to establish their career and life in the stressful urban settings; consequently use of substance becomes an attractive and convenient option. The lack of social capital may also make migrants less responsive to the social capital-based collective efficacy (volunteer actions by community members against deviate behaviors that may devalue the community), increasing the likelihood to engage in sexual risk behavior. When rebuilding social capital, migrants may adopt more liberal attitudes and more open values about sex, leading to sexual risk behavior. Exposure to more opportunities in urban settings will further exacerbate the likelihood. The low SES of female migrants may explain the higher HIV risk among them than among their male counterparts. The unprecedented rural-to-urban migration in China with the growing HIV/AIDS epidemic and the high prevalence of HIV risk behavior among rural migrants provide a window opportunity to investigate these issues. We will conduct the proposed research in Wuhan, China, a metropolitan city and provincial capital with a population of 8.1 million and one million rural migrants. The proposed research is highly significant and very innovative. Data for the proposed research will be collected using probability samples. The study samples will be selected using cost-effective methods supported by the GIS/GPS technology and a sample of 1200 rural migrants will be contrasted with the same number of non- migrant residents in the rural areas from where rural migrants originate and non-migrant residents in the urban areas where the rural migrants are currently living and working. In addition to survey data, sexually transmitted infections will also be assessed. We expected that findings from this research will advance our understanding of the migration-related HIV/AIDS transmission and provide needed data supporting our next step of research - devising and implementing innovative programs for HIV prevention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we propose to examine social capital and its relationship with HIV risk behavior and sexually transmitted infection among rural migrants in China using a random sample. This research is fully relevant to public health because the expected findings from this study will provide data supporting innovative HIV/AIDS prevention among Chinese rural migrants as well as migrants in general - a significant and global strategy in the era of frequent domestic and international population migration in response to globalization and the developmental disparities in the 21st century.

"Eating Disorders and Adolescent Body Image Among Boys and Sexual Minorities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To date, most research on eating disorders has focused on girls and women. However, with youth overweight and obesity rates reaching epidemic proportions, pressure to be thin and lean has likely contributed to an increased risk for all youth to engage in disordered dieting and exercise behaviors. Such behaviors not only increase the risk for developing eating disorders, but may also contribute to future weight gain and the development of comorbid psychopathology (e.g., depression). Inadequate focus, however, has been devoted to the experiences of men and of sexual minorities (gay/lesbian, bisexual), in spite of emerging evidence that their body image socialization processes may differ from those of heterosexual women, and that gender expression and sexual orientation may impact cognitive and behavioral reactions to negative body image. Such findings necessitate future studies focused on the processes that underlie gender and sexual orientation differences in disturbed dieting and exercise. To address these research imperatives, the program of research will focus on the following aims: (1) Utilize multi-wave longitudinal data on physical development, body image socialization, and dieting and exercise behaviors to elucidate the development of heterosexual and sexual minority boys and girls' body image socialization and disordered dieting and exercise behaviors. Analyses will examine the diversity in pathways to disordered dieting and exercise, and investigate how gender, sexual orientation, and the interactions between the two are linked to such developmental variability. (2) Elucidate factors that contribute to the development of boys' negative body image socialization and disordered dieting and exercise behaviors. In particular, the research will focus on pubertal development, gender expression (i.e., gender conformity), and the development of the muscularity ideal. (3) Identify unique and shared longitudinal predictors of eating disorder risk among the sexual minority subgroups, paying particular attention to gender, gender expression, level of identity disclosure (i.e., outness), identity-related distress, and sexual minority community involvement. Findings will help clarify how sexual orientation serves as both a risk and protective factor for disordered dieting and exercise behaviors. To fulfill these aims the research will utilize national data from the Growing Up Today Study, a nine-wave longitudinal cohort study begun in 1996 of over 16,000 youth who were recruited when they were between the ages of 9-14 and who are now in their mid 20s. A combination of longitudinal statistical methods (e.g., growth mixture modeling) will be used to examine diversity in the development of disordered dieting and exercise. The proposed research will be among the first to examine the confluence of physical development, body image socialization, and the emergence of disordered dieting and exercise among males and females of all sexual orientations. Findings will clarify key mechanisms of health risk and promotion as well as inform interventions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Eating disorders represent a tremendous cost to society, affecting productivity, physical health, social relationships, and well being. New research regarding gender and sexual orientation differences in the manifestation and prevalence of disturbed dieting and exercise suggest that boys and sexual minorities are understudied and underserved populations.

"CB1 Receptor PET Imaging Reveals Gender Differencesin PTSD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the widely acknowledged gender differences in the prevalence and clinical course of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), there exists a paucity of data on the neurobiological mechanisms that explain these reported gender disparities in PTSD; therefore, better understanding of neurobiological sex differences has the potential to provide understanding of the neurobiology of PTSD and will also lead to improving interventions and services for males and females.

"Sexual Orientation and Obesity:  Test of a Gendered Biopsychosocial Model    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant: Sexual Orientation and Obesity: Test of a Gendered Biopsychosocial Model Obesity is one of the most critical public health issues affecting the U.S. today. Racial and socioeconomic disparities in the determinants, distribution, and consequences of obesity are receiving increasing attention; however, one area that is only beginning to be recognized is the striking interplay of gender and sexual orientation in obesity disparities. It is now well-established that women of minority sexual orientation are disproportionately affected by the obesity epidemic, with nearly three-quarters of adult lesbians overweight or obese, compared to half of heterosexual women. In stark contrast, among men, heterosexual males have nearly double the risk of obesity compared to gay males. Despite clear evidence from descriptive epidemiologic research that sexual orientation and gender markedly pattern obesity disparities, there is almost no prospective, analytic epidemiologic research into the causes of these disparities. It will be impossible to develop evidence-based preventive interventions unless we first answer basic questions about causal pathways, as we plan to do. Our study has high potential for public health impact not only for sexual minorities but also for heterosexuals, as we seek to uncover how processes of gender socialization may exacerbate obesity risk in both sexual minority females and heterosexual males. In response to PA-07-409 ""Health Research with Diverse Populations,"" we will rigorously test our innovative gendered biopsychosocial model that is both multilevel and multisystem to explain observed sexual orientation disparities in obesity. We will use longitudinal, repeated measures survey data and also biological data from three youth cohorts: Growing Up Today Study (GUTS) 1 & 2 and National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), all ongoing prospective cohorts that together total over 47,000 youth living throughout the United States.        Obesity is one of the most critical public health issues affecting the U.S. today. Racial and socioeconomic disparities in obesity are receiving increasing attention; however, one area of disparities that is only beginning to be recognized is the striking interplay of gender and sexual orientation. Women of minority sexual orientation are disproportionately affected by the obesity epidemic, with nearly three-quarters of lesbians overweight or obese, compared to half of heterosexual women. In addition, heterosexual men have almost double the obesity risk as gay men. With both substantial burden and pronounced gender modification now documented, these disparities are of high public-health significance. In response to PA-07-409, we will rigorously test our innovative gendered biopsychosocial model to explain sexual orientation disparities in obesity with prospective, repeated measures survey data and biological data from three national youth cohorts.

"Social and structural context of HIV/STI risk among FSWs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this application is to use social epidemiological methods to prospectively evaluate the impact of social, environmental, and structural factors on partner-level sexual and drug risk patterns and HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence among FSWs and to assess the feasibility of a subsequent HIV/STI intervention targeting FSWs in public place-based settings (e.g. bars, streets). Despite growing evidence of the effectiveness of environmental-structural HIV/STI interventions targeting FSWs, this research has been largely derived from developing country settings and establishment-based venues, and there is limited prospective data on the social and structural context of HIV/STI risk among FSWs in North America. Given recent reports suggest a temporal shift from an injection to a sexually-driven HIV epidemic among street-involved populations in many North American settings, there is a crucial need for more prospective data on the contextual factors promoting and constraining partner-level sexual and drug risk patterns and HIV/STI acquisition. Vancouver, Canada is ideally suited for the proposed study for several reasons. First, due to the quasi-criminalized nature of sex work and large informal tolerance zones, we are in a unique position to evaluate the context of HIV/STI risk among FSWs, not currently feasible in most US cities. Second, unlike many urban environments where the FSW community is fragmented, the current social and legal context of sex work in Canada, our ability to harness strong community FSW support for this application, and new supportive housing models currently operating legally as quasi-brothels demonstrate significant innovation and strong potential for a subsequent intervention stemming from the results of this research. Herein we propose to create an open prospective cohort of 500 active FSWs working in public place-based settings, including interview administered questionnaires and HIV/STI screening at baseline and 6monthly follow-up over a five year period. To our knowledge this study is among the first prospective studies of public place-based sex work in North America and as such, we will be uniquely positioned to evaluate the risk environment and temporal trends in partner-level risks and HIV/STI acquisition among FSWs. This research will address several questions central to the urgent challenges facing HIV/STI prevention capacity in North America and will directly assess the feasibility of a subsequent intervention that will be of critical importance to other developed country settings.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While there is growing concern in many North American cities of a temporal shift from an injection to a sexually-driven HIV epidemic, there has been limited prospective evaluation of the broader risk environment and HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence among FSWs. Using social epidemiological methods, this research will address this gap by evaluating the impact of the physical and social environment, gender inequities, and structural factors on partner-level sexual and drug risk patterns and HIV/STI acquisition among an open cohort of 500 FSWs.

"An HIV Intervention Tailored for Black YMSM in the House Ball Community DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent HIV surveillance data show that men who have sex with men (MSM) are the only risk group in which the number of new infections rose annually from 2001-2006 (Hall et al., 2008). Among persons aged 13-24, Blacks are disproportionately affected by HIV infection accounting for 55% of all HIV infections reported (CDC, 2005). These racial disparities among MSM persist in the Chicago area, with the HIV prevalence rate among Black MSM (30.1%) more than twice that of White (11.3%) and Hispanic MSM (12.0%) (Chicago Department of Public Health, 2009). The racial disparity in HIV prevalence rate is even more striking among youth ages 18-24, with 24.2% among Black YMSM compared to 2.3% for White YMSM and 6.5% for Hispanic YMSM (CDPH, 2009). Despite the urgent need, there are no theoretically based, culturally appropriate behavioral interventions to reduce the risk of sexual acquisition or transmission of HIV among BYMSM. Furthermore, there are no HIV prevention interventions specifically targeting the House Ball community, an understudied and clandestine subculture of the Black gay community with high HIV prevalence (Sanchez et al., 2009; Marks et al., 2008; Murill et al., 2005). The d-up! Defend Yourself"" intervention, which has shown efficacy with BMSM (Jones et al., 2008), may be particularly well-suited for reaching BYMSM in the House Ball community. An adaptation of Kelly's Popular Opinion leader (POL) intervention ((Kelly et al., 1991,1992,1997,2006; Fernandez et al., 2003, 2005), d-up! Defend Yourself! utilizes opinion leaders from within the community to change social norms and perceptions of BMSM regarding safer sex practices (Jones et al., 2008). d-up! is delivered by members of the targeted community, thus providing ""intravention"", an approach most appropriate for insulated and marginalized communities such as the House Ball community (Bailey, 2009; Friedman et al., 2004). In this application, we propose to tailor the d-up! intervention for relevance with the Chicago House Ball community and then conduct a small, pilot trial to test for feasibility and acceptability. We will begin by conducting a series of focus groups in order to identify persuasive, culturally-appropriate messages and identify intervention targets. Based on focus group data, we will then tailor the intervention to be relevant for the Chicago House Ball community. We will then use Kelly and colleagues (2004) procedures for identifying popular opinion leaders from within the community and inviting them to participate in the study. We will implement a baseline community risk assessment by obtaining a convenience sample of approximately 150 youth attending the School of Opulence over three consecutive weeks. Then, opinion leaders will be trained on the tailored intervention over a period of four weeks. We will conduct four equally spaced (3, 6, 9, 12 months post-baseline) cross-sectional follow-up assessments of convenience samples of youth (i.e. approximately 150 youth at each time point) from the House Ball community. The follow-up assessments will include measures of sexual risk behavior in the past 3 months and exposure to the intervention through opinion leaders and marketing materials over the past 3 months. Opinion leaders will be asked to rate the acceptability of the intervention and the feasibility of communicating risk reduction messages within their social networks. Feasibility of the overall intervention will also be assessed by the number of opinion leaders recruited that agreed to be trained, the number of risk reduction conversations documented by opinion leaders, and retention of the opinion leaders over the project period.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: For this application, we will examine the feasibility and acceptability of a popular opinion leader intervention for use with Black, young men who have sex with men that participate in the House Ball community in Chicago. The aim of such an intervention is to decrease HIV infections in a community already disproportionately impacted by HIV. This intervention has great potential to directly impact the lives of young men who have sex with men in the House Ball community and to decrease HIV transmission to sexual partners inside and outside of the community.

"Syndemic Production among Emergent Adult Men  PROJECT SUMMARY: Recent trends in U.S. urban centers indicate a rise in the number of new HIV infections in the population of young men who have sex with men (YMSM). These trends suggest a high level of vulnerability to HIV seroconversion in YMSM through sexual behavior as they emerge into adulthood. In addition, acts of sexual risk taking in this population often function synergistically with illicit drug use, and mental health burden. Despite some success with HIV prevention in the MSM population during the last 25 years, these recent patterns suggest that a reexamination of our prevention strategies for this population, especially for YMSM of color, is needed. Given the interplay that exists between unprotected sexual behavior, illicit drug use, and mental health burden, all such efforts must consider how these overlapping epidemics (also known as syndemics) fuel each other in a cohort of YMSM as they emerge into adulthood. Thus, we will we will initiate a prospective longitudinal program of research to follow the development of syndemics in a racially/ethnically and economically diverse cohort of urban HIV-negative YMSM in New York City as they transition from adolescence into young adulthood, and apply, test, and further develop a theory of syndemic production to understand the development of both maladaptive and adaptive behavioral outcomes. Specifically we seek to (1) develop and test theoretically informed measurement models of the covariance of illicit drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and mental health burden among emergent adult HIV-negative YMSM within and across time, (2) assess whether patterns of behavior are continuous, discontinuous, or some combination of both; (3) delineate the risk and protective bases-physical factors (i.e., pubertal onset, HIV status), relational factors (i.e., family history of psychopathology, current romantic relationships, peer support, and characteristics of residential, social, and sex neighborhoods), and psychosocial factors (i.e., sexual identity, internalized homophobia, hypermasculinity, racial identity, racial devaluation, HIV optimism) that predict the development of syndemics, and (4) determine the extent to which the development of syndemics varies by race/ethnicity, social class, and homelessness/housing stability in a cohort of HIV-negative YMSM. Using multiple measurement modalities, which include biological assays, calendar based methods, and self-reports, we will follow the development of 675, 18-year-old HIV-negative YMSM. Participants will be recruited through venue-based and respondent driven sampling, as they emerge into adulthood, over seven waves of data collection within a 36-month time frame. We will utilize Structural Equation and Latent Growth Curve Analysis to answer our four main research questions.  RELEVANCE The goal of this project is to understand why a new generation of young men who have sex with other men place themselves at risk for HIV transmission. Knowledge which we will generate will help us understand how these young men emerge into adulthood, the choices they make about sexual behavior and illicit drug use, as well as how these two behaviors interact with their mental health. We seek to understand why some men exhibit risky behaviors as they emerge into adulthood while others do not. Working with community and municipal partners, we will draw from what we have learned from both groups to develop strategies for HIV prevention and intervention that are relevant to this current and developing generation who did not live through the devastation of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980's. In addition, we will add to the methodological literature based on our analysis of nested latent growth curve models.",Syndemic Production among Emergent Adult Men,8221011,R01DA025537,"['Accounting ',

"Evaluating a Structural and Behavioral HIV Risk Reduction Program for Black Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the MEN Count intervention, an HIV intervention and prevention program for heterosexual Black men. The MEN Count model integrates HIV risk reduction and gender-equity counseling with housing and employment case management via multiple one-on-one sessions delivered by a peer case manager over 60-90 day period. MEN Count was developed and pilot tested using a CBPR approach via funding from an NIH R21, in Boston, MA. Similar CBPR methods accompanied by a more rigorous evaluation design (i.e., a randomized controlled trial- RCT) will be used to test MEN Count in an employment training community service agency for Black men in Philadelphia (NCCF). Study participants (N=504) will be Black men reporting heterosexual risk for HIV [unprotected sex with a woman in the past 30 days and 2+ female sex partners in the past 6 months] and either current unemployment or homeless in the past 6 months. To evaluate the effectiveness of MEN Count, a two-armed RCT will be conducted in which participants will be randomized to receive either MEN Count or an attention comparison program similar to MEN Count in structure but focused on general men's health- nutrition, exercise and primary health care utilization. We will assess program impact on reduction in number of unprotected sex episodes and incident cases of STI (Chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis) via survey and STI testing, respectively, at baseline and 6 and 12 month follow-ups. Additionally, quality assurance and process evaluation efforts will be conducted to ensure high quality program adherence and delivery, as well as to support program replication should the model prove effective.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the MEN Count intervention, an HIV intervention and prevention program for heterosexual Black men.

"Sex Differences: Pathophysiology of Symptomatic Non-Obstructive Coronary Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K23 Career Development Award application has been designed to launch the academic research career of the candidate, Dr. Jennifer Tremmel. Dr. Tremmel is a Cardiologist at Stanford, trained in both preventive and interventional cardiology, whose career goals are to become an independent clinical investigator and thought leader in the fields of women's cardiovascular health and sex differences in cardiovascular disease. Her career development plan centers on the research question of whether or not there is a sex difference in the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease. Specifically, she asks if women presenting with symptoms suggestive of angina, but demonstrating no angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease, are more likely than similarly presenting men to have coronary endothelial dysfunction, coronary microvascular disease, and diffuse deposition of coronary atherosclerotic plaque. Her specific aims are: 1. To compare the incidence and severity of coronary endothelial dysfunction between women and men using intracoronary acetylcholine (Ach) and quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). 2. To compare the incidence and severity of coronary microvascular disease between women and men using the coronary pressure wire to measure coronary flow reserve (CFR) and the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR). 3. To compare the epicardial artery atherosclerotic burden and distribution between women and men using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Her development plan is designed around this research, focusing on development in four key areas: 1) Sex- Based Medicine, 2) Advanced Statistical Analysis and Data Interpretation, 3) Vascular Biology, and 4) Non- invasive techniques for assessing endothelial function and coronary pathophysiology. This development will allow her to successfully conduct her research proposal and will prepare her for the next phase of her career as an independent investigator. Dr. Tremmel will be conducting her research in a premier academic environment under the supervision of outstanding mentors and collaborators. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This research has a direct relevance to public health. The burden of cardiovascular disease is great and there is a growing body of evidence describing differences between the sexes. Continued investigation into these sex differences will add to our knowledge regarding sex-based outcome disparities and should prompt a change in our current approach to diagnosis and treatment, particularly among women.

"INITIATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF CONCURRENT PARTNERSHIPS: A LONGITUDINAL STUDY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Concurrent sexual partnerships-or partnerships which overlap in time-have been suggested as a significant contributing factor in STI/HIV transmission and acquisition. However, most studies of concurrency have utilized cross-sectional study designs with retrospective recall of behavior. As a result, little is known regarding factors associated with the initiation of concurrent partnerships, and very few studies have assessed the quality of concurrent sexual partnership data. Different motivations for initiating concurrent sexual partnerships have been associated with different degrees of STI/HIV risk. Retrospective recall is subject to known methodological challenges including memory failure and imprecision; as concurrency is typically defined by an overlap in self- reported dates of partnership, establishing the degree of reporting error in sexual partnership dates has important implications for the classification of concurrency in both research and public health practice. We will analyze data from a racially and ethnically diverse sample of young adults aged 18-30 and their sexual partners studied in the Project on Partner Dynamics (POPD) to examine to what extent: 1) a participant's belief that his/her partner has another sexual partner (perceived partner concurrency) predicts the participant's initiation of a concurrent partnership during the following 4 months; 2) sexual partners report the same dates for their first sexual intercourse (anal, oral, or vaginal) and for their last sexual intercourse; and 3) the observed association between perceived partner concurrency and subsequent concurrency initiation is affected by potential error in recall of dates. The POPD study recruited 537 persons from Los Angeles area community sites for a one-year study of heterosexual partnering, including interviewer-administered questionnaires about sexual risk perceptions, intentions, and behaviors at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. At 8- and 12-months, participants were invited to bring a sexual partner for interview. Index and partner respondents were interviewed separately and also jointly, to obtain couple-level answers on selected survey iteMs. We will use generalized estimating equations (GEE) to estimate the association between perceived partner concurrency and subsequent initiation of concurrent behavior over the following 4-months. We will compare reported dates of first and last sexual encounters within the partnership by examining partnership-level agreement, including percent agreement, weighted kappa, and the distribution of differences in reported dates. We will use the observed distribution of differences in a sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of potential reporting error on the classification of concurrency and on the observed association between perception of partner concurrency and subsequent initiation of concurrency. This information on the quality of concurrency measurement has important implications for STI research. Knowledge about predictors of concurrency initiation may provide insights into addressing STI disparities among racial/ethnic minorities.   The fellowship applicant will analyze data from a racially and ethnically diverse sample of young adults aged 18-30 years and their sexual partners, studied in the Project on Partner Dynamics (POPD), to examine to what extent: 1) a participant's belief that his/her partner has another sexual partner (perceived partner concurrency) predicts the participant's initiation of a concurrent partnership during the following 4 months; 2) participants accurately report the beginning and ending dates sexual partnerships; and 3) the impact of likely inaccuracy in reporting of partnership dates on the observed association between perceived partner concurrency and subsequent concurrency initiation.",INITIATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF CONCURRENT PARTNERSHIPS: A LONGITUDINAL STUDY,8257786,F31HD068126,"['Interview ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Literature ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Memory ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Questionnaires ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' Weight ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Measurement ', ' Respondent ', ' Knowledge ', ' Oral ', ' Equation ', ' Participant ', ' Agreement ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' age difference ', ' Reporting ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' risk perception ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' aged ', ' high risk ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' sexual encounter ', ' Affect ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Coitus ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Fellowship ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Interviewer ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2012,31082,0.0626873988101783
"STI/HIV Prevention: Sexual milieu of African American Collage Students    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Due to their enhanced risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV/AIDS, the need to target young African American men and women in college is substantial and there is a significant contribution to be made in designing risk reduction interventions that are specifically targeted to this group. Sixty-one percent of people under 25 diagnosed with HIV/AIDS during 2001-2004 were African American (CDC, 2007). The disproportionate number of cases among this group, combined with the high levels of sexual experimentation and prevalence of STIs among young people, suggests that African American college students are at higher risk and should be a programmatic AND research priority. For many students, the college environment provides a sense of new independence, self-determination, and peer pressure to engage in risky sexual behaviors. Therefore, this study will investigate a culturally grounded, multi-dimensional model of student sexual decision-making and behavior among African American students attending a historically Black institution in North Carolina. This model hypothesizes that sexual decision-making and behavior are shaped by psychosocial factors such as gender role identity, sociosexual orientation, and perceived mate availability. These factors are mediated by perceived vulnerability and social norms, and moderated by varying levels of perceived self- efficacy, spirituality/religiosity, and sensation-seeking. The study uses a three-phase, successive mixed-method approach. The qualitative data obtained from 96 students in Phase I (focus groups) will be used to operationalize the constructs used to inform the quantitative survey (320 students) in Phase II. Phase III (townhalls) is designed to function as an efficient way to disseminate the information to the student body with a goal of building a campuswide prevention initiative. A better understanding of factors associated with African American college students' risky and responsible sexual behavior is needed to help guide the development of strategies and interventions to reduce the rate of HIV infection in this population, and advance the translation of culturally grounded research into effective practice.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The disproportionate number of HIV/AIDS cases among African Americans, combined with the high levels of sexual experimentation and prevalence of STIs among young people, suggests that the sexual milieu of African American college students is an area where more culturally and ecologically appropriate research is necessary. For many students, the college environment provides a sense of new independence and self-determination, plus also peer pressure to engage in risky sexual behaviors. Given the extended latency period for developing observable HIV-related symptoms, it is likely that many adults with AIDS were infected when they were college students (Bazargan, Kelly, Stein, Husaini, & Bazargan, 2000), which is why studying this population is so important. Therefore, this study will investigate a culturally grounded, multi-dimensional model of student sexual decision-making and behavior among African American students attending a historically Black institution in North Carolina. This model hypothesizes that sexual decision-making and behavior are shaped by psychosocial factors such as gender role identity, sociosexual orientation, and perceived mate availability. These factors are mediated by perceived vulnerability and social norms, and moderated by varying levels of perceived self-efficacy, spirituality/religiosity, and sensation-seeking. The study uses a three-phase, successive mixed-method approach. A total of 416 students will be recruited during phases I and II.

"SEX EFFECTS ON CHEMOKINE MEDIATED CNS AUTOIMMUNITY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in the most common inflamatory disease of the nervous system, manifested by attacks of muscle weakness and loss of coordination, visual disturbances, bladder dysfunction and cognitive impairment. In the United States, MS is ranked as the second leading cause of neurologic disability among young adults, most notably women of childbearing age. For decades, it has been known that women are more susceptible than men to MS but the reasons for this health disparity are unclear. There is also plenty of clinical and experimental evidence that pregnancy lessens MS symptoms. However, women after childbirth suffer a worsening in disease severity. Also, women commonly exhibit the relapsing-remitting form of MS and have fluctuations in disease severity with their menstrual cycle. All this information suggest that female sexual hormones are deeply involved in MS onset and progession and understanding this component of MS is essential for the design of novel therapeutic strategies. Our lab, has found that normal human brain and mouse spinal cord tissues exhibit ablumenal localization of the chemokine CXCL12 at their vasculature. However, specimens from patients with MS and mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) exhibit relocation of CXCL12 to the lumenal surfaces of vessels. This alteration in CXCL12 expression has been shown to impact on the egress immune cells localized in spaces around microvasculature, enhancing disease severity during EAE. In preliminary studies, we have determined that the naive female SJL mouse, which may be induced to develop relapsing-remitting EAE via active immunization, exhibits lumenal CXCL12 expression within the white matter microvasculature, while the naove male SJL mouse, which does not develop relapsing-remitting EAE, exhibits ablumenal CXCL12 within all spinal cord regions. Microarray and corroborating quantitative PCR analysis comparing gray (cortical) and white (cerebellar) matter tissues from naove 10 week-old male and female SJL mice detected significantly 2-fold increased expression of the Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor 2 (S1PR2), also known as Edg-5, in the cerebella of female SJL mice compared with male SJL cerebella and with both male and female SJL cortices. S1PR2 is a member of a G protein-coupled receptor family of endothelial differentiation genes with 8 members. Agonists of S1P receptors have previously been shown to be effective targets for the treatment of EAE and MS, predominantly through immunosuppressive mechanisms. FTY720, an agonist of S1P receptors, is known to cause retention of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissue via the specific activation of S1PR1/Edg-3, inducing lymphopenia in vivo. Furthermore, suppression of S1PR1 signaling by FTY720 has negative effect on CXCR4-mediated lymph node egress. Our preliminary data, however, suggests that an alternative receptor, S1PR2, might be a more specific target for manipulation of BBB biology during brain and spinal cord autoimmunity. In addition, our data reveals that white matter expression of this receptor exhibits sexual dimorphism, which suggests that it might be relevant for the development of relapsing-remitting MS. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that sexually dimorphic expression of S1PR2/Edg-5 impacts on the polarity of CXCL12 expression at the BBB through effects on adherent junction integrity, which, in turn, impacts on sexually dimorphic patterns of disease expression during EAE.

However, many scientist in the field recognize the involvement of female sexual hormones in the initiation and progression of MS and understanding this component is essential for the design of novel therapeutic strategies.

Our lab, has found a protein called CXCL12 to play an important role in allowing inflammatory cells to get into the brain. The purpose of this research project is to elucidate the contribution of female sexual hormones in this process.",SEX EFFECTS ON CHEMOKINE MEDIATED CNS AUTOIMMUNITY,8261396,F32NS074824,"['Affect ', '

"Exploring an HIV Testing Intervention Model (TIM project)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exploring an HIV Testing Intervention Model (TIM project) Among Black Men Who Have Sex with Men Ages 18 to 30 The rate of new HIV infections across the U.S. remained relatively stable (approximately 50,000 per year) from 2006 to 2009; yet, the rate of new infections for young Black men who have sex with men (BMSM), those 13 to 29, actually increased. Thus, the impact of HIV/AIDS on Black/African American residents has been large in the U.S., and the state of California. Because of the elevated risk of infection and prevalence of new HIV infections among BMSM aged 18 to 29, it is critical to ensure that sexually active young BMSM get tested for HIV every 3-6 months. In addition to the known risk factors associated with HIV among young BMSM, recent findings suggest that poly-drug use (e.g., methamphetamine, cocaine) has increasingly become common among young BMSM. The synergy that exists between drug use, and the concentrated levels of HIV in the young BMSM population, makes the development of HIV prevention and intervention programs tailored for BMSM a priority for the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Hence, in-line with a priority of NIDA, reducing racial/ethnic disparities in HIV testing, access, and utilization of treatment and services, the proposed project seeks to increase HIV testing uptake among BMSM. The goal of this proposed research is to develop and pilot test an intervention to increase HIV testing among young BMSM. More specifically, findings from a recently completed formative research study will be used to inform the development of the HIV testing video intervention. Next, feedback will be received from focus groups with BMSM. Then, a randomized control pilot study will be conducted to examine the feasibility of using social networking to host discussions among the intervention group to enhance the intervention videos for increasing HIV testing. Participants will use Facebook ""Like"" feature, for discussions about HIV testing uptake and testing sites, drug use and sexual risk behavior, and view intervention videos. Findings from this study may offer new eHealth information, and support the use of using social networking to enhance HIV interventions, and encourage HIV testing uptake among young BMSM. Additionally, the intervention may be useful for reaching more BMSM who may not otherwise consider testing because of stigma or limited access to knowledge about the importance of HIV testing uptake.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Exploring an HIV Testing Intervention Model (TIM project) among Black Men who Have Sex with Men ages 18 to 30.

"Origin of Repeat Bacterial STIS Among Heterosexual Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent reports of an increase in possible treatment failure of azithromycin for Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) and Mycoplasma genitalium (Mg) call for a better understanding of the origin of these repeat infections, so that providers can more efficiently target their treatment approach. For example if treatment failure is the origin, better medications are needed; if re-exposure to an untreated partner, better partner treatment strategies are needed; if exposure to a new partner, rescreening is indicated. Our preliminary data showed that the likely source of repeat infections among heterosexual men with Ct is multi-causal and treatment failure was substantial. These classifications, however, were based on self-reported sexual histories which may have over- estimated treatment failure. Genotyping data could provide a more objective method for classifying, but methodological issues with genotype-informed studies have made the origins of repeat infections difficult to interpret. We focus on heterosexual men, not just because their repeat infection rates are high, but because of their influence on women's health. Several decades of female-targeted interventions have failed to reduce the Ct epidemic. Clearly, interventions must also target men, particularly those with repeated infections, who may be core transmitters. We will also examine Mg, since there is mounting evidence that it is an important source of reproductive health morbidity and high rates of repeat infection have been documented. The goal of the study is to reduce early repeat infections with Ct and/or Mg among heterosexual men. Aim 1: To quantify the likely origins of early repeat infections with Ct and/or Mg among heterosexual men - We will combine data from electronic sexual diaries, test of cure computer assisted interviews and state-of-the-art genotyping of Ct and/or Mg to calculate the most likely source of repeat infection at test-of-cure. We hypothesize that there are multiple origins of repeat infection and that treatment failure is substantial (i.e. > 6%), which requires a re-evaluation of the present treatment guidelines. Aim 2: To conduct in-depth exploration of the origins of repeat Ct and/or Mg infections and explore adaptations of EPT and/or rescreening among heterosexual men. In-depth interviews will be conducted with men who do (n=30) and do not (n=30) have repeat Ct and/or Mg infections to enhance our understanding of the subtle, nuanced aspects of risk behaviors and contexts that lead or do not lead to repeat infections. These data will allow for the development of more gender appropriate counseling and interventions to reduce repeat infections among heterosexual men. To achieve these aims, we extend work started in our R56. Men attending two urban STD clinics (n=4777) will be screened for Ct/ Mg. Men with either organisms (~2327), will complete a weekly electronic sexual diaries, and return for a test of cure screening and interview 4 weeks post baseline. Specimens from men with repeat Ct and/or Mg infections (200 for each) will be genotyped. This research fits well within NIAID's goals of reducing health disparities/providing more effective STD treatment.          Recent reports indicate substantial treatment failure of single dose azithromycin for Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) and Mycoplasma genitalium (Mg). A better understanding of the origin of these repeat infections is needed, particularly among men with repeat infections who may be core transmitters, so that providers can more efficiently target their treatment approach. Genotype-informed quantitative and qualitative methods will more accurately evaluate the origins of these repeat infections and help to determine if treatment failure is a key source of repeat infections to inform treatment guidelines.

"A Stress Process Model of Depression and Sexual Risk Among HIV Seropositive MSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award for Individual Predoctoral Fellows in Nursing Research is to provide Aubrey Florom-Smith, a second year BSN to PhD doctoral student, with a rich and varied training experience during her dissertation period. Two years of funding are requested affording the applicant, through the proposed training plan, a hands-on experience conducting a quantitative study and increased mentorship and guidance from talented sponsors and co-mentors experienced in every facet of the proposed study. Field experiences with nationally recognized research teams and health care providers experienced in HIV/AIDS and health care issues affecting men who have sex with men living with HIV/AIDS (MLWHA) will enhance the applicant's experience. Additional graduate level coursework will further augment her knowledge of HIV/AIDS as a social, cultural, political and behavioral health issue. Further, she will enhance her career development by acquiring valuable contacts for future endeavors and disseminating her findings through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at local, national and international conferences.  The proposed cross-sectional, observational study, testing alternate stress process models predicting depression and sexual risk among MLWHA, is predicated upon the concept that stressors, in the form of gay- related or HIV-related discrimination, may impact health-related behaviors and mental health, depression and high risk sexual behavior, and that the effect of stressors can be influenced by intervening chronic strains, such as internalized homophobia and internalized HIV-related stigma. Alternate models will examine whether the intervening variables are statistical moderators or mediators. Because the chronic strains (internalized homophobia and internalized HIV-related stigma) are conceptualized as emerging from the stressors (discrimination), negative life events and social support will be explored to place these stressors within the context of the individual's stress process. Demographic variables will be examined as control variables to ensure they do not mask the effects of interest. An investigation of the pathways linking these factors may result in increased opportunities for more efficacious HIV prevention intervention development with this population.  The University of Miami School of Nursing and Health Studies, which contains the NCMHD-funded Center of Excellence for Health Disparities Research: El Centro, and which has close ties to outstanding scholars and both physical and community resources, provides an ideal setting for the proposed training plan. An NRSA would provide a solid foundation upon which the applicant could base her future efforts as a nurse scientist, educator and advocate to help reduce new HIV infections and enhance the mental and physical wellbeing of MLWHA.         Gay and bisexual men compose the group of individuals at greatest risk of acquiring HIV, as members of the at-risk group that has experienced increases in HIV infections steadily over the past several decades (CDC, 2010b). Because gay and bisexual men living with HIV or AIDS remain subject to ongoing discrimination due to HIV infection and sexual minority status, and because these factors may be related to depression and high risk sexual behavior, a better understanding of the important links between discrimination, depression and high risk sexual behavior is needed. The knowledge gained from the proposed study may be used to develop programs delivered within community or health organizations to reduce the negative effects of discrimination, and ultimately reduce the number of new HIV infections among this group of highly at-risk men.

"Social Contexts, Sexual Networks, and Racial-Ethnic Disparities in STDs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research component of this project explores how racial-ethnic segregation and inequality shape sexual networks and the spread of sexually transmitted disease (STD). Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health), I will explore how racial- ethnic segregation and inequality at the school- and neighborhood-levels influence the formation of sexual partnerships. Applying parameter estimates from the Add Health to simulated sexual networks, I will then assess how sexual networks and disease diffusion may progress differently in settings with varying population compositions and patterns of racial-ethnic inequality. Informed by structural sociological theory, this research takes an interdisciplinary approach and applies testable social science hypotheses to problems of infectious disease epidemiology. Through relationships with mentors and advisors, coursework, and participation in professional seminars, the training component of this project would allow me to expand my work on health disparities to include (i) greater attention to social contexts and networks as determinants of health, and (ii) new types of contagious health outcomes. There are three career development objectives for the proposed project: (i) obtain skills and expertise in infectious disease epidemiology and network analysis; (ii) conduct original research on racial-ethnic STD disparities in the U.S.; and (iii) prepare a major grant to support an independent research program in social networks, health disparities, and infectious disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are large racial-ethnic disparities in sexually transmitted diseases in the United States. This project explores how racial-ethnic segregation and inequality across schools and neighborhoods shape the structure of sexual networks, and how differences in sexual networks may lead to different epidemic outcomes in communities with varying racial-ethnic and socioeconomic make-ups.

"Sexual Partnerships Among African American Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although young people ages 15 to 24 years represent only a quarter of the sexually experienced population, they represent nearly half of all new sexually transmitted diseases (STD). This group is at increased risk for HIV and STD acquisition due to biological, behavioral, and cultural factors. Literature indicates that women, compared to men, are significantly more likely to report a partner having concurrent sexual partnerships, 17% versus 8% respectively. With the alarmingly disproportionate prevalence of HIV and AIDS cases among African American women, recent research points towards the impact of concurrency to address this racial and gender disparity. Having concurrent sexual partnerships increases the likelihood of STD transmission among partners. Having sex within a network of partners with high STD and HIV rates further increases the risk of STD transmission. The goal of this research is to explore and understand the context of having multiple, or concurrent, sex partners among young African American women aged 18 to 25 in heterosexual partnerships. This study is grounded in the theory of gender and power and outcome expectancies, or incentives, as described in the social cognitive theory. The Specific Aims are to 1) understand the reasons young adults engage in concurrent sexual partnerships, 2) identify and understand condom use in the context of concurrent sexual partnerships, and 3) propose a framework for understanding the context of and factors related to concurrency among African American young women. Women will be selected from an ongoing study and invited to participate in the present study. The study will recruit African American young women (n=40) aged 18 to 25 years to participate in semi-structured interviews lasting 45 to 60 minutes. Interview transcripts will be coded using Nvivo 8.0 software, calculating inter-rater agreement and using thematic coding for themes that emerge. Quantitative data will be collected after completing the semi- structured interviews and will recruit a new sample (n=250) of African American women. The computerized survey includes measures of self-reported STD history, sexual history, self-reported sexual behaviors, as well as beliefs and attitudes related to sexual partnerships, concurrency, partner variables, drug and alcohol use, depression, education, and income. The study will propose a path model based on factors significantly predictive of concurrency. This study will contribute to the literature by examining additional factors based on the theory of gender and power and social cognitive theory.

"A systems science approach to understanding sexual risk behavior in young women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young women are at disproportionate risk of STIs and their consequences, with the highest rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea, as well as outcomes such as pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility and cervical cancer. This disease burden has a disparate on some groups of young women, such as racial/ethnic minorities and women of low socio-economic status. To date, most research and prevention programs have focused on individual- level predictors of sexual risk behavior measured at a single time point (e.g., behavioral intentions, attitudes). However, individuals' intentions to engage in risky or protective behaviors may vary across contexts and over the course of relationships. By applying a cutting-edge analytic technique to richly detailed, intensive longitudinal data, we will extend research on sexual risk behavior to address the relationship dynamics that influence these behaviors. This project will make use of data collected weekly from nearly 1,000 young women over 2.5 years, including detailed information about their relationships, sexual behavior, contraceptive use, attitudes and intentions. We will apply a novel analytic technique, the time-varying effect model, to understand women's sexual risk behavior over the course of the relationship with a sexual partner. This project has three specific aims. First, we will model patterns of young women's non-use of condoms over the course of sexual partnerships. Second, we will examine how women's intentions to use condoms differentially predict condom non-use over the course of sexual partnerships. Finally, we will delve into sources of disparities in sexual health outcomes by examining how these patterns of sexual risk behavior may differ by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic factors and urbanicity. By modeling how sexual risk behavior evolves over the course of a relationship, the proposed project will inform the creation of more effective prevention programs that are targeted to high risk populations and relationships contexts.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will allow us to understand how sexual risk behavior evolves over the course of a sexual partnership, and how this evolution may help explain disparities in outcomes for minority and low-SES young women. By applying cutting-edge techniques to richly detailed intensive longitudinal data, we will reveal patterns of sexual risk behavior that will allow us to build prevention programs tailored to address the specific needs of high-risk populations and relationship contexts. Ultimately, this will reduce STI-related morbidity and mortality.            ",A systems science approach to understanding sexual risk behavior in young women,8564970,R03HD077011,"['Accounting ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' Decision Making ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Evolution ', ' Future ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' unable to bear children ', ' infertile ', ' Difficulty conceiving ', ' Cannot achieve a pregnancy ', ' Infertility ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Pelvic Pain ', ' extrauterine pregnancy ', ' Ectopic Pregnancy ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' European ', ' sexually active ', ' Pelvic Inflammatory Disease ', ' Logistics ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' condoms ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' protective behavior ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' young woman ', ' ']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2013,62850,0.06857565815395972

"Social-Structural Stressors, Resilience and Sexual Risk Behaviors Among Black Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to exact a severe toll on Black men in the U.S. Although they represent just 14% of the male population, Black men accounted for 47% of HIV cases among men in 2009. The association between disproportionately high rates of HIV/AIDS in Black communities and social-structural factors such as poverty, neighborhood instability, and incarceration are well documented. Despite increasing advocacy for more social-structural approaches to HIV prevention however, considerable gaps in knowledge exist about how social structural stressors at the population-level and sociodemographic stressors at the individual-level (e.g., individual socioeconomic status, perceptions of racial discrimination) are associated with Black men's sexual HIV risk behaviors. There is also a dearth of knowledge about how resilience at both the neighborhood and individual-level may protect against Black men's sexual HIV risk behaviors. We propose a 5-year cross-sectional multiphase mixed methods study in Philadelphia, PA, in which we use geospatial analysis, qualitative methods, and multilevel quantitative modeling to refine and test a conceptual model of neighborhood-level social-structural stressors, individual-level sociodemographic stressors, psychological risk factors, neighborhood-level and individual-level resilience, and Black men's sexual HIV risk and protective behaviors. The study has 3 phases. Phase I includes focus groups to explore neighborhood-level social- structural stressors and resilience and to inform spatial data analyses of social-structural stressors (e.g., neighborhood poverty, neighborhood instability, crime) that may be associated with Black men's sexual HIV risk behaviors. Phase II involves the multilevel modeling of social-structural and sociodemographic stressors (e.g., individual SES), psychological risk factors, resilience, and sexual HIV risk and protective behaviors with a probability sample of 700 Black men between the ages of 18 and 44, of all sexual orientations, recruited from 100 Census block-groups. Phase III involves the integration of the study's results with spatial data visualization and culturally grounded explanations based on interviews with 30 Black men, followed by focus groups to confirm the study's interpretations. The expected outcome of this innovative study is that it will guide the development of structural interventions to reduce HIV incidence in Black men and their sexual partners regardless of the partners' gender. The overall positive impact of the research is that it will advance empirical knowledge about the multilevel social-structural stressors and resilience of Black men's lives with implications for reducing HIV incidence and other health disparities prevalent among Black men. The proposed study is highly responsive to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy's stated goals of reducing HIV incidence in Black men and women.          The disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS among Black men makes the development of innovative HIV prevention research that can inform structural interventions for this population, a top public health priority. The proposed research is highly relevant to public health HIV prevention initiatives in general, and in particular to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy's stated goals of reducing HIV incidence in Black men and women.                    ","Social-Structural Stressors, Resilience and Sexual Risk Behaviors Among Black Men",8656010,R01MH100022,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Poverty ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Testing ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Advocacy ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' psychological stressor ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Phase ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Individual ', ' Knowledge ', ' stressor ', ' Prevention Research ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Population Intervention ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' unstably housed ', ' unstable housing ', ' instably housed ', ' housing instability ', ' protective behavior ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health priorities ', ' ']",NIMH,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,650131,0.07812067388634635

"Tobacco Use and Cardiovascular Disease in Sexual Minority Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco use, in particular cigarette smoking, is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States.1 In addition to lung cancer and respiratory illness, tobacco use is responsible for increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and is a primary causal factor for two specific types of CVD: coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke.1,2 More than eighty-one million persons in the United States have at least one form of CVD, and CHD and stroke rank as the first and third leading causes of death, respectively.3,4 Recent research indicates lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) individuals have the highest rates of tobacco use.9,10 Within this group, sexual minority men (i.e., men who identify as gay, bisexual, or who engage in same sex sexual behavior) have one of the largest smoking disparities, with a smoking rate of more than twice that of their heterosexual counterparts.9 Yet, we know almost nothing about tobacco use in sexual minority men or the extent to which tobacco use may be responsible for increased CVD in this population. Accordingly, the proposed study will utilize both nationally representative and clinic-based data to examine the relationship between the prevalence and patterns of tobacco use among sexual minority men and potential disparities in CVD. In addition the proposed project will also investigate the role of HIV infection as a potential effect measure modifier in the relationship between tobacco use and CVD. These objectives are consistent with the goals of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and relate to NIDA's strategic plan to foster research on health conditions that may inform, influence or interact with drug abuse and addiction, to decrease health disparities related to drug addiction and its consequences, and to decrease the health disparities associated with HIV/AIDS. With access to the resources of Saint Louis University and the Fenway Center for Population Research in LGBT Health, a well-crafted and carefully designed research training plan, and the support of an excellent mentoring team, the applicant is ideally suited to carry out the proposed research. The multi- disciplinary mentoring team brings expertise in the areas of epidemiologic outcomes research, psychiatric epidemiology, LGBT population research, cardiology, and biostatistics, and is fully committed to supporting the applicant throughout the training period. The long term goal of the applicant is to obtain a faculty position and develop an independent research career in the areas of chronic disease epidemiology and LGBT population health, and as such, the proposed research will play a key role in developing the applicant's potential for a promising research career.        This project will enhance our understanding of disparities in tobacco use among sexual minority men and the potential contribution of these disparities to increased cardiovascular disease among this population. This information is necessary to identify and address potential disparities in cardiovascular disease for sexual minority men, and may ultimately lead to a reduction in cardiovascular disease and death.

"Prostate Cancer Detection Decision-Making for Low-Income African American Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excess mortality due to prostate cancer among African American men is one of the most intractable cancer disparities. In the San Francisco Bay Area, incidence in this group is 40 percent higher and mortality is more than twice that for non-Hispanic White men. Research to increase early detection in this high risk group has stalled due to controversies surrounding the efficacy of the PSA test and even though the equivocal studies that tested the PSA did not include adequate samples of African American men. Resulting national guidelines emphasize shared decision-making (SDM) prior to PSA testing, a process to elucidate a patient's values and preferences and to foster his understanding of the limitations of the test. Because disproportionately more African American men have low literacy skills, it is not clear whether SDM is feasible or commonly practiced in settings where low-income men and/or those of low educational attainment access cancer screening such as health fairs and public health clinics. We propose first to ascertain current and best possible pre-screening SDM communication practices in these settings. Second, because the PSA debate is largely due to over-treatment of low-risk disease and since approximately 95 percent of PSA test results are normal, we will explore the feasibility of shifting the focus of SDM from screenin to pre-biopsy counseling for the 5 percent of men with elevated PSAs. For this community-based participatory and mixed methods study, our specific aims are: 1. To document current practices in shared decision-making for PSA testing where uninsured, low-income and/or low-literacy African American men obtain screening, and to explore the potential for effective SDM communication in these settings.  a. conduct in-depth interviews with 20 clinicians, 20 staff, and 20 patients regarding SDM and screening to  ascertain key concepts, barriers, and facilitators, and to inform survey questions;  b. conduct observations of 200 men at community screenings to document SDM in these settings;  c. measure PSA test and SDM practices, preferences and confidence regarding SDM, barriers to SDM,  and tailoring by race/ethnicity and health literacy in a survey of 150 providers with practices of at least 10 percent  African American patients. 2. To assess the feasibility of pre-biopsy counseling (PBC) for African American men with an elevated PSA by pilot testing a theory-based PBC protocol with 40 men with a recent abnormal test.                PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study addresses one of the most intractable cancer disparities, the excess mortality due to prostate cancer experienced by African American men. Efforts to increase early detection in this population have stalled due to the controversies surround efficacy of the PSA test and concerns regarding over-treatment of early stage disease. Experts recommend that all men engage in ""informed decision-making"" (consideration of benefits, harms, risks and how these factors fit with individual values), usually in conversation with their doctor. Our study will assess the viability of this process in settings where low-income men obtain care, and the feasibility of decision-making prior to biopsy among men whose PSA test results are abnormal.            ",Prostate Cancer Detection Decision-Making for Low-Income African American Men,8411716,R21CA171953,"['Anthropology ', ' Biopsy ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Counseling ', ' Decision Making ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Fairs ', ' Incidence ', ' Influentials ', ' Interview ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urology ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Decision Aid ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Uninsured ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Radiation Oncology ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Staging ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Test Result ', ' preference ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Provider ', ' Commit ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Health Communication ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Communication Research ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Process ', ' health literacy ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' safety net ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' community based participatory research ', ' PSA test ', ' PSA screening ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2013,170511,-0.07886069467270346
"CB1 Receptor PET Imaging Reveals Gender Differencesin PTSD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the widely acknowledged gender differences in the prevalence and clinical course of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), there exists a paucity of data on the neurobiological mechanisms that explain these reported gender disparities in PTSD; therefore, better understanding of neurobiological sex differences has the potential to provide understanding of the neurobiology of PTSD and will also lead to improving interventions and services for males and females. We propose to recruit N=12 medication-free female patients with civilian PTSD, measure their CB1 receptor-selective radioligand [11C]OMAR volumes of distribution (VT), an equivalent of CB1 receptor expression using PET and compare them with 12 men with PTSD, as well as individually age, gender and BMI-matched controls with (TC, N=24) and without (HC, N=24) trauma history.

"PROMOTING UPTAKE OF A USUAL SOURCE OF CARE AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men experience disproportionately poorer health outcomes compared to most other demographic and racial groups. For example, compared to all other males, African American men have a higher incidence of uncontrolled hypertension, higher death rate from heart disease, and a higher incidence of most of the major cancers. They die on average 5 to 10 years earlier than men and women of most other racial and ethnic groups. One factor recognized as a contributor to these disparities is lack of a usual source of health care. Having a usual provider is particularly beneficial to the health of African American men because consistent providers can establish trust, provide regular preventive care, and better manage care on a long- term basis for improved outcomes. Yet public health interventions aimed at promoting a usual source of care among African American men have not been widely disseminated. One approach that has been used successfully in public health campaigns to influence different subgroups within a population is health marketing. The health marketing approach is a multi-step research strategy by which individuals comprising a given population (e.g., African American men) are meaningfully classified into distinct subgroups whose members share a constellation of characteristics relevant to a criterion (e.g., having a usual source of care). Using this strategy, health communications are custom tailored for each identified subgroup in a health- promoting intervention. The goals of the proposed study are (a) to apply health marketing strategies to identify and characterize distinctive subgroups of African American men with respect to having a usual source of care, and (b) to explore preferences within subgroups for message content and communication channels that will be most effective in promoting uptake of a usual source of care among these men. The research plan of the project consists of two phases. First, statistical classification techniques will be used to identiy specific subgroups of African American men according to relationships between selected predictor variables (e.g., medical mistrust, various facets of masculinity) and behaviors related to having a usual source of care. Second, focus groups will be formed from men in the identified subgroups in order to better understand factors associated with African American men's having a usual source of care and to explore preferences for health communications approaches that might be most informative and motivating within the different subgroups. Using this health marketing approach, health communications can then be custom tailored for each particular subgroup in a future health-promoting intervention. Results of the proposed study will enhance the success of future tailored interventions designed to increase the uptake of a usual source of healthcare among vulnerable African American men.          African American men are less likely than most other demographic and racial groups to have a usual source of health care. Having a usual provider or site of care is important to the health of African American men because sustained continuity can result in increased trust, improved receipt of preventive care, and better health-related outcomes. This project aims to identify and characterize distinctive subgroups of African American men who do not have a usual source of care, and to explore preferences within subgroups for message content and communication channels that will be most effective in promoting uptake of a usual source of care among these men.

"Reducing Risk of HIV/STD Infection Among African American Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The high rates of sexually transmitted disease (STD), including HIV, among African American (AA) men who reside in urban areas are a major public health problem. In addition, the most common route of HIV transmission among AA women is heterosexual exposure. Yet, little research has focused on gender-specific strategies to dissuade heterosexually active AA men from engaging in high HIV/STD transmission risk behaviors. Accordingly, the broad, long-term objective of this research is to develop such strategies. The Specific Aims include testing the efficacy of a theory-based, gender-specific contextually appropriate HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention in increasing consistent condom use, identifying theoretical mediators that account for the intervention's effects, and testing a strategy to increase the longevity of the intervention's effects. This research will utilize a randomized controlled trial design with 360 inner-city AA men 18 to 45 years who report recent unprotected vaginal or anal intercourse with a woman. Men will be randomly allocated to one of two small-group interventions specially designed for AA men: (a) a HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention or (b) a health promotion control intervention on healthful diet and physical activity. To evaluate a strategy to increase the longevity of intervention effects, the men also will be randomized to receive or not receive individually tailored mailings to reinforce the intervention's message. The approach draws on social cognitive theory, the theory of planned behavior, and the applicant's Preliminary Studies with AA men. The primary outcome is self-reported consistent condom use during vaginal and heterosexual anal intercourse in the previous 3 months collected at baseline and 6 and 12 months post-intervention via audio-computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI). Secondary outcomes include other sexual behaviors and theoretical variables hypothesized to mediate intervention efficacy. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) and random effects models will be employed to address the Specific Aims.               RELEVANCE: This research may provide an urgently needed intervention to reduce the risk of STDs, including HIV, in African American men, one of the highest risk populations in the US. Moreover, African American women have 20 times the rate of HIV seen in White women, with over 75% of the cases are tied to sexual relations with men. However, few trials have tested gender-specific HIV/STD risk-reduction interventions for heterosexually active men.",Reducing Risk of HIV/STD Infection Among African American Men,8390437,R01MD004075,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Mails ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Planning Theory ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' Woman ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Physical activity ', ' infectious disease transmission ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' disease transmission ', ' Native Americans ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Life ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Route ', ' behavior change ', ' Equation ', ' inner city ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' trial design ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' cost ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' high risk ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' consistent condom use ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2013,370259,0.00770674393320103
"A Culture Centered Narrative Approach for Health Promotion     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latina adolescents experience high rates of birth, HIV infection, and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), both nationwide and in Holyoke.1 Latinas have the highest teen birth rate of any major ethnic/racial minority in the U.S. at 70.1/1000 births, in comparison to an overall teen birth rate of 39.1/1000.2 Among all racial/ethnic groups, Latinos rank second for all adult and adolescent HIV diagnoses.3 In 2009, U.S. Latinas ages 15-19 had rates of Chlamydia at 21.9/1000, in comparison to 11.37/1000 for their white peers.4 Behavioral interventions that seek to promote safer sex among Latino/a youth often fail to address the cultural values that can drive individual's decisions and actions. As a result, they are often ineffective.5 There is a clear imperative to identify, disseminate, and implement culturally specific narrative-based interventions.  Interventions that engage youth participants in arts- and narrative-based processes, 6-8 while also acknowledging their everyday realities and the variability in meanings of sexuality, including a positive sexuality perspective, 9, and 10 may be effective for promoting sexual health and wellbeing. By foregrounding the voices of young Latinas to articulate their own meanings of health, and considering these perspectives in the development of health promotion programs,11 culture-centered approaches can effectively promote positive sexual health outcomes.12,13 While culturally centered content has been linked to sexual health promotion among young Latinas, with culture-centric health promotion messages evaluated for their overall effectiveness,13,19,20 the narrative process itself has not been well tested for the way that it works as a mechanism of health promotion. Our multidisciplinary project team proposes to use a ""young person-driven, researcher-facilitated"" narrative methodology21 to address this research gap.  The proposed project takes a narrative approach, using digital storytelling (DST) to rigorously map the mechanisms by which participants form culturally specific meanings of sexuality, sexual health, and wellbeing. Resulting culturally specific data will be used to inform the future development of culturally centered sexual health interventions. The impact of the process will result in increased levels in self-esteem and clarity of personal sexual values, increases in sexual decision-making and communication skills, and an increase in perceived choices in one's actions among participants. The specific aims of this project are to (1) Identify cultural paradigms of sexual health among three groups of adolescent Puerto Rican Latinas; (2) Assess the effects of the process of creating digital stories on participants' sexual attitudes/values, self-determination, and use of protective behaviors; and (3) Explore the perceived value of produced digital stories for workshop participants, to inform the choice of resonant digital stories for use in a larger scale promotion effort in the next phase of research.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Latina adolescents experience high rates of birth, HIV infection, and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), both nationwide and in Holyoke, the proposed site for this exploratory project.

The core elements of the intervention (i.e., the digital storytelling process) will be generalizable to other cultural group, while other important features (i.e., the digital stories themselves) will be adaptable, thereby increasing the utilization of findings.            ",A Culture Centered Narrative Approach for Health Promotion,8583835,R21HD075081,"['Accounting ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Arts ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Birth Rate ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Elements ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Maps ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Music ', ' Persons ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Self Determination ', ' self esteem ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Sexuality ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Phase ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' computer imaging ', ' digital imaging ', ' experience ', ' fluidity ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' cultural values ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' protective behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' teen birth ', ' migration ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' trial comparing ', ' safer sex ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R21,2013,207505,0.007239368656377615
"Health Promotion for Positives: A Randomized Trial with HIV Positive Black Men  PROJECT SUMMARY:      This application is in response to RFA-MD-12-001, ""NIMHD Health Disparities Research (R01)."" African  American men who are infected with HIV are living longer and are being impacted by the same chronic  diseases that affect the general population of African American men over 40.  To be sure, African American  men, in general, have disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, kidney  disease, and cancer, particularly prostate and colon cancer.  However, HIV infection is associated with an  increased risk for co-morbidity from chronic diseases.  This increased risk is heightened by HIV infection, but  also its treatment with certain agents used in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) combinations.  Many  of these chronic illnesses have behavioral components-risk is influenced by what people do and don't do,  their diet, and the amount of physical activity they get.  Although the high risk for multiple behavior-linked  chronic diseases among HIV-positive individuals has been recognized, there is a lack of evidence-based  intervention specifically tailored to their needs. Hence, the broad objective is to reduce the risk of chronic  diseases among HIV positive African American men.  The Specific Aims are to test the efficacy of a theory- based, contextually appropriate health promotion intervention in inducing positive changes in behaviors linked  to risk of chronic diseases among HIV positive African American men age 40 years or older and to identify the  theoretical variables that mediate its efficacy.  The study will utilize a randomized controlled trial.  The  participants will be 384 African American HIV positive men age 40 or older who are receiving HAART for HIV.   The men will be randomized to a theory-based contextually appropriate health promotion intervention that  involves three, 3-hour weekly intervention sessions or an attention-control group.  The health promotion  intervention will be an adaptation of an intervention based on social cognitive theory integrated with formative  research and found to be efficacious in increasing adherence to 5-a-Day diet and physical activity guidelines  and prostate cancer screening guidelines in the applicants' preliminary studies.  Data will be collected at  baseline, immediately post, 3, 6 and 12 months post intervention, which will permit assessment of the short- term and long-term effects of the intervention and whether the intervention's efficacy varies over time.  Audio  computer-assisted self-interviewing will be used to assess self-reported adherence to physical activity  guidelines, 5-a-Day fruit and vegetable guidelines, prostate screening guidelines, and colon cancer screening  guidelines and theoretical mediators of behavior change.  Objective outcomes will include health-related fitness  (6-minute walk test, 1-minute push-up test, 1-minute sit-up test, sit-and-reach test), physiological variables  (blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-hip ratio), and prostate and colon cancer  screening based on medical record review.       8.  PROJECT NARRATIVE     Highly activity antiretroviral treatment (HAART) for HIV has caused dramatic decreases in HIV-related  opportunistic infections and mortality~ hence, people are living longer with HIV.  Aging is associated with  increased risk of chronic diseases, but HIV infection and HAART also heighten these risks.  Even in the  absence of HIV, African American men are at disproportionately high risk for chronic disease morbidity and  mortality.

"Aging, Stress & Health among Gay-Identified Men: Linking Past and Present     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The AIDS epidemic and the growing social enfranchisement of sexual minorities over the past three to four decades has had a profound impact on the lives of the current cohort of midlife and older gay-identified men (hereinafter, gay men), yet little is known about how the general health status of these men has developed over this time. The proposed exploratory study (a) will analyze 27 years of health and psychosocial data from an existing sample of HIV- and HIV+ midlife and older gay men (b) in conjunction with new data from this sample to be collected with the ""Aging, Stress, and Health among Gay Men"" (ASH-GM) survey. The sample is the original cohort of the Los Angeles (LA) site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS, current N = 400; mean age=57, range=43-79). Begun in 1984, the MACS are one of the longest running natural history studies of HIV/AIDS. These data are especially valuable because multiple biopsychosocial domains have been measured biannually since the study's inception, providing a unique data repository that serves as the foundation for innovatively studying aging processes among gay men from a life course perspective. We propose to further develop and test a novel ""life course and sexual minority aging stress model"", integrating (I) the life course perspective (e.g., trajectories, transition, turning points); (ii) the general stress process model (e.g., financial strain, psychosocial resources); (iii) the minority stress model (e.g., stigmatization); and (iv) aging-related stressor (e.g., independence concerns). A key feature of this conceptual model is the intersection of history with individual biography. The life course concept of trajectories will be operationalized as a latent class mixture model to create clusters of similar trajectories with the 27 years of longitudinal data for two prototypes: health (depressive symptoms, cardiovascular disease) and psychosocial resources (having a confidant). The test of the theoretical model first examines the impact of the types of stressors listed above with current health status, along with the mediating and moderating role of psychosocial resources. This conventional approach is then innovatively elaborated by examining the main and interactive effects of the trajectories to test whether the impact of current conditions on health is conditional upon the past. Due to the dearth of longitudinal data on sexual minorities, research using a life course perspective to study aging among this population will necessarily rely on retrospective data. We will innovatively evaluate such retrospective reports by exploiting the longitudinal design of the MACS to compare reports made at the time to new retrospective reports of the same constructs collected with the ASH-GM. Our specific aims are to: (1) design and implement the ASH-GM; (2) analyze 27-year trajectories with existing MACS-LA data; (3) test the novel theoretical model using both sets of data; and 4) evaluate the use of retrospective reports to study the life course of midlife and olde gay men. Findings will be informative to emergent research on aging among these men, and will provide preliminary data for an RO1 application that will longitudinally expand this exploratory study to all four MACS sites.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The population of midlife and older gay men is increasing exponentially as the baby boomer generation comes of age. The AIDS epidemic and growing social enfranchisement of sexual minorities have transitioned over the past three decades, but little is known about how the general health status of gay men has developed over this unprecedented historical period. The proposed study explores 27 years of health and psychosocial data from an existing sample of midlife and older gay men and concatenates these longitudinal data with new data regarding contemporary stress and aging processes to investigate ways of characterizing and explaining health disparities among these men.            ","Aging, Stress & Health among Gay-Identified Men: Linking Past and Present",8446268,R21AG042036,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Age Reporting ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Baltimore ', ' Biography ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Chicago ', ' Cognition ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Data Collection ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Epidemic ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hybrids ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Marriage ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Running ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Identity ', ' Social Identification ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Typology ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Mediating ', ' TimeLine ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Natural History ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Gays ', ' Case Fatality Rates ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Life ', ' Route ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Population Study ', ' Social status ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' social stress ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Legal ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Aging Process ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' longitudinal design ', ' sexual minority ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2013,176056,0.02408683520437502
"Exploring an HIV Testing Intervention Model (TIM project)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exploring an HIV Testing Intervention Model (TIM project) Among Black Men Who Have Sex with Men Ages 18 to 30 The rate of new HIV infections across the U.S. remained relatively stable (approximately 50,000 per year) from 2006 to 2009; yet, the rate of new infections for young Black men who have sex with men (BMSM), those 13 to 29, actually increased. Thus, the impact of HIV/AIDS on Black/African American residents has been large in the U.S., and the state of California. Because of the elevated risk of infection and prevalence of new HIV infections among BMSM aged 18 to 29, it is critical to ensure that sexually active young BMSM get tested for HIV every 3-6 months. In addition to the known risk factors associated with HIV among young BMSM, recent findings suggest that poly-drug use (e.g., methamphetamine, cocaine) has increasingly become common among young BMSM. The synergy that exists between drug use, and the concentrated levels of HIV in the young BMSM population, makes the development of HIV prevention and intervention programs tailored for BMSM a priority for the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Hence, in-line with a priority of NIDA, reducing racial/ethnic disparities in HIV testing, access, and utilization of treatment and services, the proposed project seeks to increase HIV testing uptake among BMSM. The goal of this proposed research is to develop and pilot test an intervention to increase HIV testing among young BMSM. More specifically, findings from a recently completed formative research study will be used to inform the development of the HIV testing video intervention. Next, feedback will be received from focus groups with BMSM. Then, a randomized control pilot study will be conducted to examine the feasibility of using social networking to host discussions among the intervention group to enhance the intervention videos for increasing HIV testing. Participants will use Facebook ""Like"" feature, for discussions about HIV testing uptake and testing sites, drug use and sexual risk behavior, and view intervention videos. Findings from this study may offer new eHealth information, and support the use of using social networking to enhance HIV interventions, and encourage HIV testing uptake among young BMSM. Additionally, the intervention may be useful for reaching more BMSM who may not otherwise consider testing because of stigma or limited access to knowledge about the importance of HIV testing uptake.          Exploring an HIV Testing Intervention Model (TIM project) among Black Men who Have Sex with Men ages 18 to 30. The goal of this proposed research, Exploring an HIV Testing Intervention Model (TIM project), is to develop and pilot test an intervention to increase HIV testing among young Black men who have sex with men (BMSM). Participants will use Facebook ""Like"" feature for discussions about HIV testing uptake and testing sites, drug use and sexual risk behavior, and view intervention videos.

"Sex Differences: Pathophysiology of Symptomatic Non-Obstructive Coronary Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K23 Career Development Award application has been designed to launch the academic research career of the candidate, Dr. Jennifer Tremmel. Dr. Tremmel is a Cardiologist at Stanford, trained in both preventive and interventional cardiology, whose career goals are to become an independent clinical investigator and thought leader in the fields of women's cardiovascular health and sex differences in cardiovascular disease. Her career development plan centers on the research question of whether or not there is a sex difference in the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease. Specifically, she asks if women presenting with symptoms suggestive of angina, but demonstrating no angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease, are more likely than similarly presenting men to have coronary endothelial dysfunction, coronary microvascular disease, and diffuse deposition of coronary atherosclerotic plaque. Her specific aims are: 1. To compare the incidence and severity of coronary endothelial dysfunction between women and men using intracoronary acetylcholine (Ach) and quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). 2. To compare the incidence and severity of coronary microvascular disease between women and men using the coronary pressure wire to measure coronary flow reserve (CFR) and the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR). 3. To compare the epicardial artery atherosclerotic burden and distribution between women and men using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Her development plan is designed around this research, focusing on development in four key areas: 1) Sex- Based Medicine, 2) Advanced Statistical Analysis and Data Interpretation, 3) Vascular Biology, and 4) Non- invasive techniques for assessing endothelial function and coronary pathophysiology. This development will allow her to successfully conduct her research proposal and will prepare her for the next phase of her career as an independent investigator. Dr. Tremmel will be conducting her research in a premier academic environment under the supervision of outstanding mentors and collaborators. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This research has a direct relevance to public health. The burden of cardiovascular disease is great and there is a growing body of evidence describing differences between the sexes. Continued investigation into these sex differences will add to our knowledge regarding sex-based outcome disparities and should prompt a change in our current approach to diagnosis and treatment, particularly among women.

"Computer-based HIV Prevention for Seropositive Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexual transmission is the predominant route of HIV infection in the United States, and it is men who are primarily spreading the virus. Male-to-male sexual contact accounts for 72% of all new HIV infections in men while heterosexual contact accounts for 83% of all new HIV infections in women. Extrapolating this incidence data reveals that 75% of all new HIV cases result from high risk sexual activity by men. These new infections are also not evenly distributed throughout the population. African Americans comprise only 14% of the US population, but account for 44% of the new infections. Black men, in particular, are disproportionately burdened, accounting for 70% of new HIV cases among African Americans. In addition, African Americans tend to have sex with people of the same race. As the prevalence of HIV increases within this community, the risk of infection concomitantly increases with each new sexual encounter. Given this epidemiological reality, reducing sexual risk behaviors among African American HIV+ men who have sex with men (MSM), with women (MSW), and with both men and women (MSM/W) is a prevention imperative. To address this, we intend to develop and test Positively tHrIVing, an HIV behavioral intervention based on modules 2 and 3 of the Healthy Living Project (HLP; a ""best evidence"" CDC intervention), and then tailored it to fit the unique needs of HIV+ African American men (both MSM and MSW). This will include a focus on the distinctive challenges faced by all men independent of race (e.g., the influence of gender roles on sexual risk behaviors), faced by African-Americans living in the United States (e.g., discrimination, socioeconomic issues), and the intersection of these factors with the gender of sexual partners (e.g., managing power inequalities in heterosexual relationships v. facing homophobia and cultural issues). Additionally, Positively tHrIVing will adopt a pro-health point of view so that it will be perceived as supportive and nonstigmatizing. Finally, Positively tHrIVing will be computer-based to further increase acceptability among patients and physicians, reduce staff time, lower costs, increase fidelity of treatment delivery, and enhance the probability of widespread dissemination. The results of Phase I strongly support the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the program - far exceeding the three usability benchmarks established in the Phase I proposal. In Phase II we will complete development of the Positively tHrIVing program and test its effectiveness in a pretest-posttest experimental design. 240 HIV+ African American men will be randomly assigned to receive either the computer-based Positively tHrIVing program or flash-enabled STD CDC fact sheets. Before, and at two points after random assignment, participants' sexual transmission risk behavior, medication adherence, disclosure, health behaviors, and substance use will be assessed through an online survey-questionnaire.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to develop a computer-based HIV behavioral intervention for HIV+ African American men. For clinics, this will allow them to provide an empirically validated HIV prevention intervention to their clients without creating additional demands on their already overburdened staff. For HIV+ African American men, the skills contained in this program will help them reduce risk behaviors and, ultimately, prevent the spread of HIV.            ",Computer-based HIV Prevention for Seropositive Men,8542209,R44MH103800,"['Test Result ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' meetings ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' sexual encounter ', ' injection drug use ', ' Accounting ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Consultations ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Gender Role ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Probability ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Route ', ' ']",NIMH,"ISA ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2013,578663,0.06835719573481122
"Probability-based survey of HIV risk among transmen using a novel sampling method     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study seeks to address two pressing scientific needs: 1) to improve ways to sample and recruit hard-to-reach minority populations for inclusion in research and 2) to fill a gap in our knowledge of the health problems faced by female-to-male transgender persons (transmen). Minority populations unduly suffer from many diseases and mental health conditions; sexual minorities bear a particularly heavy burden of the HIV epidemic. We are seeing warning signs that transmen may be an overlooked minority population at high risk for HIV, with documented AIDS and STD cases, sex partners who are gay men and male-to-female transgender persons (transwomen) and low condom use. Transmen also appear to face discrimination and have high levels of drug and alcohol use, depression and suicide. However, reliable data are lacking to guide prevention and care programs. This exploratory study will develop and test a novel strategy to sample and recruit transmen for a survey of HIV prevalence and health risks, beginning with outreach to public places where transmen are found followed by referral of their peers. Although this study focuses on transmen, our research will invent and validate a new sampling method applicable to diverse populations affected by HIV and other health issues worldwide.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Transmen may be at high risk for HIV infection yet there is an extreme paucity of accurate data from representative samples. The primary significance of this proposed R21 is that it will develop and apply a new sampling method to obtain more representative health data on transmen. Our strategy is to assess the theoretical assumptions underlying venue-outreach and peer-referral sampling methods and combine their advantages in the field. We anticipate findings of this exploratory study will be immediately applicable to advocate for HIV prevention resources, develop appropriate new interventions and guide future research on this marginalized population. Our study also stands to enhance the inclusion and representation of other minority populations in research and provide more rigorous data from groups experiencing diverse health disparities.                    ",Probability-based survey of HIV risk among transmen using a novel sampling method,8539255,R21HD071765,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Behavior ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Hybrids ', ' male ', ' Maps ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Population Sizes ', ' Probability ', ' Records ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' seed ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Seeds ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Societies ', ' sea star ', ' Asteroidea ', ' Starfish ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Diffuse ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Gays ', ' Respondent ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' transsexual ', ' transgender ', ' experience ', ' condoms ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Categories ', ' outreach ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' Behavioral ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' time use ', ' Minority ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Guide prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' stem ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' sexual minority ', ' ']",NICHD,SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R21,2013,140827,0.012517234686482692
"Syndemic Development and HIV Risk Among Vulnerable Young Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the number of new HIV infections has been relatively stable since late 1990s, the face of the infection has changed. Half of all new infections now occur among youth and substantial disparities exist based on sexual orientation. Recent data from the National HIV/AIDS Reporting System indicate that male-to-male sexual contact accounts for 76-79% of HIV diagnoses among 16-19 year old males, although less is known about the actual prevalence of HIV and related health issues in this population. Disparities also exist in preparedness to prevent HIV among young men who have sex with men (YMSM), with no proven intervention for adolescents in this vulnerable group. The epidemic of HIV among YMSM does not exist in a vacuum. Instead, YMSM experience multiple psychosocial health disparities, including elevated rates of illicit drug use, exposure to violence, and mental health problems such as suicidality. Recent evidence indicates that these health issues represent intertwined epidemics that each contribute to HIV risk among YMSM, a situation referred to as a syndemic. Building on our own research with YMSM, as well as other high risk youth, we are proposing to investigate a syndemic of psychosocial health issues linked to HIV among YMSM ages 16-20. This syndemic includes HIV risk, drug use, internalizing mental health problems, and violence exposure. The overarching goals of this study are twofold: 1) to provide much-needed epidemiological data on the prevalence of HIV and related health issues in order to inform public health priorities; and 2) to collect vital information on risk and protective factors to inform the development of an intervention targeting this vulnerable population. We will accomplish these goals with three primary specific aims: (1) Ascertain the prevalence and clustering of a syndemic of biopsychosocial health problems among YMSM. We will: (a) Recruit a representative sample of 450 ethnically diverse YMSM using Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS); (b) Assess the syndemic components using state-of-the-art approaches; (c) Use the RDS model to calculate unbiased estimators of the prevalence of syndemic components; (d) Test for the clustering of syndemic components. (2) Characterize multiple trajectories of syndemic development by following our YMSM sample longitudinally over a two year period. We will: (a) Assess youth every 6 months during the transition from late adolescence to emerging adulthood, to explore the natural history of syndemic development. (b) Use growth-mixture modeling to characterize groups of youth with different trajectory classes of syndemic development in order to allow for early identification of youth most at risk of HIV acquisition. (3) Determine the importance of YMSM-specific factors in syndemic development so as to guide the development of culturally-relevant HIV prevention interventions for our target population. We will: (a) Test the value of YMSM-specific factors as predictors of trajectory class; (b) Test the incremental value of our theoretical syndemic model for predicting HIV-related sexual risk relative to the IMB model.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) are at elevated risk for a syndemic of biopsychosocial health problems. This syndemic includes HIV risk, substance use, internalizing mental health problems, and violence exposure. The overarching goal of this study is to collect information on YMSM-specific risk and protective factors, which can then be used to inform the development of an intervention targeting this vulnerable population.

"Syndemic Production among Emergent Adult Men  PROJECT SUMMARY: Recent trends in U.S. urban centers indicate a rise in the number of new HIV infections in the population of young men who have sex with men (YMSM). These trends suggest a high level of vulnerability to HIV seroconversion in YMSM through sexual behavior as they emerge into adulthood. In addition, acts of sexual risk taking in this population often function synergistically with illicit drug use, and mental health burden. Despite some success with HIV prevention in the MSM population during the last 25 years, these recent patterns suggest that a reexamination of our prevention strategies for this population, especially for YMSM of color, is needed. Given the interplay that exists between unprotected sexual behavior, illicit drug use, and mental health burden, all such efforts must consider how these overlapping epidemics (also known as syndemics) fuel each other in a cohort of YMSM as they emerge into adulthood. Thus, we will we will initiate a prospective longitudinal program of research to follow the development of syndemics in a racially/ethnically and economically diverse cohort of urban HIV-negative YMSM in New York City as they transition from adolescence into young adulthood, and apply, test, and further develop a theory of syndemic production to understand the development of both maladaptive and adaptive behavioral outcomes. Specifically we seek to (1) develop and test theoretically informed measurement models of the covariance of illicit drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and mental health burden among emergent adult HIV-negative YMSM within and across time, (2) assess whether patterns of behavior are continuous, discontinuous, or some combination of both; (3) delineate the risk and protective bases-physical factors (i.e., pubertal onset, HIV status), relational factors (i.e., family history of psychopathology, current romantic relationships, peer support, and characteristics of residential, social, and sex neighborhoods), and psychosocial factors (i.e., sexual identity, internalized homophobia, hypermasculinity, racial identity, racial devaluation, HIV optimism) that predict the development of syndemics, and (4) determine the extent to which the development of syndemics varies by race/ethnicity, social class, and homelessness/housing stability in a cohort of HIV-negative YMSM. Using multiple measurement modalities, which include biological assays, calendar based methods, and self-reports, we will follow the development of 675, 18-year-old HIV-negative YMSM. Participants will be recruited through venue-based and respondent driven sampling, as they emerge into adulthood, over seven waves of data collection within a 36-month time frame. We will utilize Structural Equation and Latent Growth Curve Analysis to answer our four main research questions.  RELEVANCE The goal of this project is to understand why a new generation of young men who have sex with other men place themselves at risk for HIV transmission. Knowledge which we will generate will help us understand how these young men emerge into adulthood, the choices they make about sexual behavior and illicit drug use, as well as how these two behaviors interact with their mental health. We seek to understand why some men exhibit risky behaviors as they emerge into adulthood while others do not. Working with community and municipal partners, we will draw from what we have learned from both groups to develop strategies for HIV prevention and intervention that are relevant to this current and developing generation who did not live through the devastation of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980's. In addition, we will add to the methodological literature based on our analysis of nested latent growth curve models.",Syndemic Production among Emergent Adult Men,8657517,R01DA025537,"['Accounting ',

"Evaluating a Structural and Behavioral HIV Risk Reduction Program for Black Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the MEN Count intervention, an HIV intervention and prevention program for heterosexual Black men. The MEN Count model integrates HIV risk reduction and gender-equity counseling with housing and employment case management via multiple one-on-one sessions delivered by a peer case manager over 60-90 day period. MEN Count was developed and pilot tested using a CBPR approach via funding from an NIH R21, in Boston, MA. Similar CBPR methods accompanied by a more rigorous evaluation design (i.e., a randomized controlled trial- RCT) will be used to test MEN Count in an employment training community service agency for Black men in Philadelphia (NCCF). Study participants (N=504) will be Black men reporting heterosexual risk for HIV [unprotected sex with a woman in the past 30 days and 2+ female sex partners in the past 6 months] and either current unemployment or homeless in the past 6 months. To evaluate the effectiveness of MEN Count, a two-armed RCT will be conducted in which participants will be randomized to receive either MEN Count or an attention comparison program similar to MEN Count in structure but focused on general men's health- nutrition, exercise and primary health care utilization. We will assess program impact on reduction in number of unprotected sex episodes and incident cases of STI (Chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis) via survey and STI testing, respectively, at baseline and 6 and 12 month follow-ups. Additionally, quality assurance and process evaluation efforts will be conducted to ensure high quality program adherence and delivery, as well as to support program replication should the model prove effective.          The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the MEN Count intervention, an HIV intervention and prevention program for heterosexual Black men. The MEN Count model integrates HIV risk reduction and gender-equity counseling with housing and employment case management via three one-on-one sessions delivered by a peer case manager over 60-90 day period. A two armed randomized controlled trial will be used to evaluate the impact of MEN Count, relative to an attention comparison condition focused on diet and exercise, on reduction in unprotected sex and incident STI, as measured via computerized survey and STI tests at baseline and 6 and 12 month follow-ups.

"Male Incarceration, the Health Care Service Environment and Sexual Health Project Summary/Abstract Compared to areas with low rates of incarceration, areas with higher rates of incarceration have higher and increasing rates of sexually transmitted infections (hereafter STIs).[1,2] One study also found a statistically significant association between rates of male incarceration and rates of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).[1] Few studies have examined these relationships and even fewer studies have been conducted to explore the reasons for these higher rates.  This proposed mixed-method study will use the Social Cognitive Theory and the Social Ecological Model to fill this critical gap. The following three research aims seek to look beyond the individual and consider environmental contextual factors: Aim 1: Using qualitative methods, examine and compare the processes through which male: female sex ratios influence sexual networks and partnership formation and maintenance among heterosexual African-American women living in two types of census tracts: a tract that has higher male incarceration rates and a tract that has lower male incarceration rates; Aim 2: Investigate the relationship between male incarceration rates and rates of HIV and other STIs in Atlanta census tracts over time (2005- 2010); Aim 3: Explore health care service availability as a moderator of the relationship between rates of male incarceration and rates of HIV and other STIs. The long term objective of this study is to gain a greater understanding of how male incarceration rates and the health care service environment influence individuallevel sexual and reproductive health. The information gained by achieving the aims of this study could be used to inform the development of programs and policies aimed at mitigating the adverse impact of rates of male incarceration on the transmission of HIV and other STIs.  The principal investigator (hereafter PI) will use qualitative methods to achieve Aim 1 and quantitative methods to achieve Aims 2 and 3. Qualitative methods are best suited to address Aim 1 because these methods are particularly useful for understanding contextual influences and also for discovery,[3-5] both of which are important for emerging research on the macro-social determinants of STIs and HIV. The PI will interview women from two Atlanta, GA census tracts, one that has a high male incarceration rate and a low male: female sex ratio, and the other that has a low male incarceration rate and a male: female sex ratio close to 1.00. Interviews will focus on sexual networks and romantic partnership formation and maintenance. To achieve Aims 2 and 3, U.S. decennial data, STI and HIV/AIDS surveillance data, incarceration data and an inventory of health care service locations will be used to analyze the relationship between incarceration rates and STI/HIV rates in Atlanta GA census tracts, and to investigate whether spatial access to healthcare moderates these relationships. Geographic Information Software (GIS), PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS) and Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) software will be used in these analyses. Rates of HIV and other STIs are at epidemic proportions in African American populations in the U.S.[6,7] There have been calls in the literature, from the CDC and from the White House's National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States report for future studies to examine (1) how incarceration within African American communities affects HIV-risk behaviors among the sexual partners and sexual networks of those left behind and in the community at large;[8-10] (2) health care availability and sexual networks in relation to HIV and other STI health disparities.[11] The information obtained from this study could be used to inform the development of programs and policies aimed at mitigating the adverse impact of rates of male incarceration on the transmission of HIV and other STIs.","Male Incarceration, the Health Care Service Environment and Sexual Health",8414011,F31MH096630,"['abstracting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Censuses ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' LAV-2 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 2 ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type IV ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 2 ', ' HTLV-IV ', ' HIV2 ', ' HIV-II ', ' HIV-2 ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Linear Models ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Prisons ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Sex Ratio ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Life ', ' Location ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' experience ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Jail ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' surveillance data ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' ']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2013,30912,0.04976314505099253
"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Fall Risk and Bone Strength Among Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The changing shape of the U.S. population age structure will dramatically increase the number of osteoporotic fractures in the elderly; the increase will disproportionately affect minorities and men. It is therefore important to understand the epidemiology of osteoporosis in these populations. While there are clear racial/ethnic differences in fracture rates, their origins are not understood. The proposed study will be a comprehensive effort to further our understanding of the fundamental causes of racial/ethnic disparities in fracture rates by focusing on markers of two primary `upstream' determinants of fracture: falls and bone fragility. The Boston Area Community Health/Bone (BACH/Bone) Survey is a study of skeletal health in a randomly selected group of 1,219 black, Hispanic, and white men between 29-80 y. BACH/Bone staff have been very productive, producing over 10 papers for peer-reviewed journals. We propose a second wave of data collection on ~825 men to begin ~6.5 y after baseline, when the cohort will be between 35-86 y. The Specific Aims of the proposed study are to, in a racially/ethnically diverse, population-based sample of men: 1) Estimate longitudinal changes in markers of bone strength and fall risk, with and without adjustment for known risk factors; 2) Determine the relative contributions of social factors, individual risk behaviors and health status, and physiological influences to racial/ethnic differences in markers of fall risk and bone strength; 3) Establish the first age- and racial/ethnic group-specific, population-based estimates of bone microarchitecture, and identify determinants of observed age and racial/ethnic differences; 4) Determine whether there are age and racial/ethnic differences in the ratio of bone loads to bone strength (the `factor of risk'); 5) Examine whether genetic ancestry contributes to variations in markers of fall risk and bone strength beyond that attributable to self-identified race/ethnicity. The representativeness and racial/ethnic diversity of the BACH/Bone cohort are unique, and, as such, the potential impact of the study is enormous. By focusing upstream on markers of fall risk and bone strength with state-of-the-art measures, it will make landmark contributions to our understanding of the elusive mechanisms underlying racial/ethnic differences in bone fragility.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Boston Area Community Health/Bone Survey is an observational research study examining the complex relationships between aging, social structure, health and lifestyle, hormones, genetic factors, and markers of fall risk as well as bone strength in a population-based sample of racially/ethnically diverse aging men. Findings will continue to inform our understanding of bone fragility, bone loss, and osteoporosis.

"Syndemic Production among Emergent Adult Men  PROJECT SUMMARY: Recent trends in U.S. urban centers indicate a rise in the number of new HIV infections in the population of young men who have sex with men (YMSM). These trends suggest a high level of vulnerability to HIV seroconversion in YMSM through sexual behavior as they emerge into adulthood. In addition, acts of sexual risk taking in this population often function synergistically with illicit drug use, and mental health burden. Despite some success with HIV prevention in the MSM population during the last 25 years, these recent patterns suggest that a reexamination of our prevention strategies for this population, especially for YMSM of color, is needed. Given the interplay that exists between unprotected sexual behavior, illicit drug use, and mental health burden, all such efforts must consider how these overlapping epidemics (also known as syndemics) fuel each other in a cohort of YMSM as they emerge into adulthood. Thus, we will we will initiate a prospective longitudinal program of research to follow the development of syndemics in a racially/ethnically and economically diverse cohort of urban HIV-negative YMSM in New York City as they transition from adolescence into young adulthood, and apply, test, and further develop a theory of syndemic production to understand the development of both maladaptive and adaptive behavioral outcomes. Specifically we seek to (1) develop and test theoretically informed measurement models of the covariance of illicit drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and mental health burden among emergent adult HIV-negative YMSM within and across time, (2) assess whether patterns of behavior are continuous, discontinuous, or some combination of both; (3) delineate the risk and protective bases-physical factors (i.e., pubertal onset, HIV status), relational factors (i.e., family history of psychopathology, current romantic relationships, peer support, and characteristics of residential, social, and sex neighborhoods), and psychosocial factors (i.e., sexual identity, internalized homophobia, hypermasculinity, racial identity, racial devaluation, HIV optimism) that predict the development of syndemics, and (4) determine the extent to which the development of syndemics varies by race/ethnicity, social class, and homelessness/housing stability in a cohort of HIV-negative YMSM. Using multiple measurement modalities, which include biological assays, calendar based methods, and self-reports, we will follow the development of 675, 18-year-old HIV-negative YMSM. Participants will be recruited through venue-based and respondent driven sampling, as they emerge into adulthood, over seven waves of data collection within a 36-month time frame. We will utilize Structural Equation and Latent Growth Curve Analysis to answer our four main research questions.  RELEVANCE The goal of this project is to understand why a new generation of young men who have sex with other men place themselves at risk for HIV transmission. Knowledge which we will generate will help us understand how these young men emerge into adulthood, the choices they make about sexual behavior and illicit drug use, as well as how these two behaviors interact with their mental health. We seek to understand why some men exhibit risky behaviors as they emerge into adulthood while others do not. Working with community and municipal partners, we will draw from what we have learned from both groups to develop strategies for HIV prevention and intervention that are relevant to this current and developing generation who did not live through the devastation of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980's. In addition, we will add to the methodological literature based on our analysis of nested latent growth curve models.",Syndemic Production among Emergent Adult Men,8432881,R01DA025537,"['Accounting ',

"The Hampton University regional Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hampton University, as the lead institution for the Hampton University (HU)-Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Transdisiplinary Collaborative Center (TCC) for research on men's health, will take a comprehensive approach to narrowing the gender gap of health disparities by harnessing the resources and expertise of eight historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to collaborate in implementing and advancing innovative transdisciplinary research that includes intervention components of research, education and outreach, and training to effectively reduce health disparities in minority men. The primary objective of the HU-HBCU TCC will be to reduce selected health disparities in minority men. It will be achieved through four specific aims: (1) Create a transparent and full participatory coalition of partners to collaboratively design, implement, evaluate and disseminate innovative transdisciplinary programs to reduce health disparities in men; (2) establish four cores and a pilot project program (Administrative, Collaborations and Partnerships, Research, Pilot Projects and Intervention Implementation) to support proposed subprojects and pilot projects, as well as, future research activities;(3) implement a sustainable and transferrable collaborative research model in six areas (cancer; cardiovascular disease, violence prevention and diabetes, obesity, melanoma) to positively influence and health outcomes of minority men; and (4) evaluate research, implementation, and dissemination activities to promote optimal use of the TCCs resources by HBCUs, government, community partners and other vital stakeholders. The potential impact of activities resulting from the HU-HBCU TCC will address the NIH Health Disparities Strategic Plan 2009-2013 as it will harness the resources and expertise of HBCUs to collaborate in implementing and advancing innovative transdisciplinary research. In addition, the proposed research that will be conducted by the HU-HBCU TCC is especially relevant to public health as its major focus includes intervention components of research, education and outreach, and training to effectively and efficiently reduce health disparities in minority men. The interdisciplinary research design and methods to achieve the goal and specific aims involve bringing together, scientists, researchers and community representatives to positively impact the health and well-being of minority men by establishing and implementing sub-projects and pilot projects with a regional focus. This proposed coordinated transdisciplinary approach to reduce and ultimately eliminate health disparities will also enable the participating partners to leverage resources and enhance collaboration.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed HU-HBCU TCC Project is especially relevant as it proposes to develop research models that will be both sustainable and transferable across communities, regions in the nation. While the preponderance of research efforts to improve health outcomes has tended to focus on research and treatment for education and awareness, we are confident that our innovative comprehensive approach will be more effective and efficient.                      ",The Hampton University regional Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center,8616466,U54MD008621,"['Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' melanoma ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Universities ', ' Gender ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' prevent violence ', ' violence prevention ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' implementation research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', "" men's health "", ' male health ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIMHD,HAMPTON UNIVERSITY,U54,2013,1500000,0.038848821088834314
"Health-Seeking Behaviors among Men with Criminal Justice and Substance Abuse Hist The proposed training program will focus on cancer risks, screening behaviors and preventive health care among men returning to the community after incarceration. Individuals who have extensive criminal justice histories have disproportionately high rates of smoking, greater burden of viral infections associated with cancer (e.g., hepatitis, HPV, HIV) and greater barriers to establishing and obtaining routine health care. Although efforts are underway to connect people to health care settings upon release, there is an absence of evidence about men's health-seeking behaviors after returning to the community. Little is known about men's motivations and intentions to participate in screening, prevention or treatment, or about contextual factors that affect their health behavior.    A five year research and training program is proposed to prepare the principal investigator for a career in cancer-health disparities and participatory health services research focused on socially-marginalized, at-risk groups, such as former prisoners. The candidate's long-term goals are to advance her skills in community-partnered research, research design and psychometric development of measures. This program will build upon her strong background in HIV/AIDS, community practice and qualitative research, by providing a deeper understanding of factors that foster cancer-related health disparities among men with histories of criminal justice and substance abuse problems. Specific training objectives are: 1) to become proficient in the development, design, and use of psychometrically-sound instruments to measure health-seeking behavior among high-risk, socioeconomically disadvantaged men; 2) to gain experience with participatory research methods, in order to maximize former offenders' involvement in research and engagement in interventions to increase their use of needed health services; 3) to learn about the design of multilevel health services interventions, in order to create a program focusing on ethnic minority men with extensive criminal justice and substance abuse histories, and; 4) to develop an understanding of the ethical issues that enter into health services research among people recently released from the criminal justice system.    Structured training activities involve coursework in methodology, psychometrics/scale development, biostatistics, epidemiology, bioethics, advanced data analysis, and correctional health research. Mentors and advisors will provide additional readings, research supervision and consultation. The research and training activities will be pursued through the Division of Community Collaboration and Implementation Science in the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine with senior researchers in a number of institutions including Columbia University and the University of Michigan. This training will provide an important foundation for collaborative planning of evidence-based community health services for this population.    The proposed research will examine the health-related needs and health-seeking behaviors of 300 men ages 35-64 that have criminal justice and substance abuse histories in New York City. Specific aims are: 1) to explore unmet health and psychosocial needs and quality of life among ethnic minority men who have extensive criminal justice and substance histories; 2) to assess health-seeking behaviors among these men, including influences on their decisions to participate in cancer screening, prevention and treatment; 3) to describe contextual barriers and facilitators that affect men's use of services; and 4) to evaluate the reliability and validity of instruments developed or adapted for use with men with criminal justice and substance use histories. In addition to characterizing men's health concerns, this study will describe barriers and facilitators to seeking care and treatment as well as the complex set of circumstances (e.g. health/illness, parenting, vocational skills, housing stability, employment, and social support) that may impede men's ability to prioritize their health care needs.    Research and training activities described in this proposal are intended to develop the community connections, preliminary data and research skills necessary for the candidate to launch an independent program of community intervention research, designed to improve health and well-being and reduce cancer burden among vulnerable and largely disenfranchised segments of our society. Public Health Relevance. The proposed K01 Research Scientist Development Award title, ""Health Seeking among Men with Criminal Justice and Substance Abuse Histories"" has serious relevance to public health agenda and priorities. Of the 7.3 million adults who are under some form of correctional supervision (e.g., probation, parole, prison and jail inmates), ethnic minority men are four times as likely than whites and nearly 2.5 times as likely to be under correctional supervision[40]. Nationwide, many states are recognizing that chronic and infectious diseases are concentrated in correctional populations and the punitive responses to nonviolent offenders are no longer a viable, economical option. Once these men return to the community, men who have extensive  criminal justice and substance abuse histories often have unequal or lack access to health care services and fail to continue treatments that were initiated during incarceration[42]. Not only do ex-offenders report a wide array of problems and unmet health needs, but cancer-health disparities also exist. The proposed study contributes to the area of cancer-health disparities research and is consistent with NCI's strategic plan to chart the risk trajectories that may contribute to cancer and other adverse health  conditions among vulnerable and disadvantaged populations.",Health-Seeking Behaviors among Men with Criminal Justice and Substance Abuse Hist,8532660,K01CA154861,"['adulthood ', '

"Exploring Patterns of Concurrency Among Urban African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed K-01 career development award explores patterns of concurrent sexual partnerships, or partnerships that overlap in time, among urban African Americans in Philadelphia. I am an Assistant Professor of Medicine (Research) in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Brown University Medical School. I hope to use the K-01 award to transition from health policy to behavioral and social science research in HIV/AIDS prevention. My long-term career goals are to pursue an academic career in order to conduct behavioral and sociological research in the field of HIV/AIDS, to publish articles in the peer- reviewed literature, and conduct HIV/AIDS research that influences public policy. I hope to use the K01 award to learn how to conduct community-based participatory research (CPBR), develop new quantitative skills for behavioral science research, acquire expertise in behavioral research for HIV prevention and HIV intervention research, and gain expertise in health disparities research and ethical conduct of research in underserved populations. The research components of my application follow: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches will be employed to explore 32-40 African American community leaders' opinions and knowledge about sexual concurrency and other factors contributing to HIV health disparities among urban African Americans. CBPR will also be used to examine African American community leaders' interest in developing and piloting novel interventions to address concurrent sexual relationships and other factors contributing to HIV health disparities among African Americans. Subsequently, differential rates of sexual concurrency and other factors that may contribute to racial disparities in HIV rates among African Americans testing for HIV in Philadelphia will be explored. This analysis will rely on secondary survey data collected during Philadelphia's rapid testing campaign, which tests approximately 6,000 people annually. The beliefs, attitudes, practices, patterns and causes of concurrent sexual partnerships will then be explored through 80 in-depth qualitative interviews among HIV- negative African American men and women testing for HIV in Philadelphia. In keeping with the CBPR framework guiding this study, the findings of each of the aforementioned research projects will be shared and explored with African American community leaders and the Philadelphia community at large. Community input about the study findings, appropriate interpretations, interventions, and public policy suggestions will be solicited. The findings from the aforementioned studies will then be used to design an R01 grant application proposing an HIV prevention intervention. The intervention will combine behavioral and social interventions to address concurrent sexual partnerships, and may aim to increase condom use rates with main and non-main partners, reduce concurrent sexual partners, or address other factors contributing to HIV health disparities among HIV-negative African Americans.

The intervention will combine behavioral and social interventions to address concurrent sexual partnerships, and may aim to increase condom use rates with main and non-main partners, reduce concurrent sexual partners, or address other factors contributing to HIV health disparities among HIV-negative African Americans.",Exploring Patterns of Concurrency Among Urban African Americans,8499170,K01AA020228,"['Age ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Belief ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Marriage ', ' Medicine ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Motivation ', ' Peer Review ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Public Policy ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Suggestion ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Businesses ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' career ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Trust ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Review Literature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' professor ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Behavioral ', ' sexual relationship ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' aged ', ' community based participatory research ', ' social science research ', ' ']",NIAAA,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,K01,2013,130523,0.05072977739918974
"Ectopic adiposity in black men with high type 2 diabetes risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) disproportionately affect black individuals. Generalized obesity and other established risk factors do not explain the racial disparity in T2D, and this is particularly evident among men. Emerging evidence indicates that fat accumulation in non-adipose tissues (referred to as ectopic adiposity) may be associated with T2D, independent of general obesity. Compared to white men, both obese and lean black men have less visceral and liver adiposity, while in contrast, they paradoxically have more skeletal muscle adiposity. Skeletal muscle is crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis, and thus, skeletal muscle adiposity may be the key adipose tissue depot contributing to increased T2D risk in blacks. However, much remains to be learned about the epidemiology of skeletal muscle adiposity, particularly among high-risk black populations. Through the K01 (DK083029) and R03 (DK092348) funded pilot studies for new investigators, the applicant has begun to investigate the epidemiology of skeletal muscle adiposity and other ectopic adipose tissue depots in a well-characterized, large cohort of black men from the Tobago Health Study. This cohort offers a unique opportunity to study a black population with low levels of total adiposity, and low prevalence of other potential confounding variables, but with a high prevalence of T2D, especially among non- obese men. We are proposing to continue and expand upon our preliminary research on ectopic adiposity in this cohort. We will take advantage of our unique resource of archived computed tomography (CT) scan image files from over 1500 black men, aged 40 years and above, to analyze skeletal muscle adiposity changes over an average of nearly 7 years, and characterize the natural history of skeletal muscle adiposity changes with aging in black men, and the temporal relationship of these changes with glucose and insulin homeostasis. We will also use archived biological specimens to measure physiologic markers of potential importance for skeletal muscle adiposity, and test several compelling hypotheses about the etiology and consequences of skeletal muscle adiposity. In addition, we will obtain new CT measures of visceral, liver, abdominal muscle and pericardial adiposity, and will test for an association of abdominal skeletal muscle adiposity with measures of glucose and insulin homeostasis, and determine if these associations are independent of liver, visceral and pericardial adiposity. The proposed study will greatly advance our understanding of ectopic adiposity and its role in T2D among high risk black men.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are escalating at alarming rates and disproportionately affect black individuals. Generalized obesity and other established risk factors do not explain the racial disparity in T2D, and this is particularly evident among men Emerging evidence indicates that fat accumulation in non-adipose tissues (referred to as ectopic adiposity) may be associated with T2D, independent of generalized obesity. In particular, skeletal muscle adiposity may be the key adipose tissue depot contributing to increased T2D risk in blacks. However, many important questions about the epidemiology of skeletal muscle adiposity remain unanswered, particularly among high-risk black men.

"INITIATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF CONCURRENT PARTNERSHIPS: A LONGITUDINAL STUDY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Concurrent sexual partnerships-or partnerships which overlap in time-have been suggested as a significant contributing factor in STI/HIV transmission and acquisition. However, most studies of concurrency have utilized cross-sectional study designs with retrospective recall of behavior. As a result, little is known regarding factors associated with the initiation of concurrent partnerships, and very few studies have assessed the quality of concurrent sexual partnership data. Different motivations for initiating concurrent sexual partnerships have been associated with different degrees of STI/HIV risk. Retrospective recall is subject to known methodological challenges including memory failure and imprecision; as concurrency is typically defined by an overlap in self- reported dates of partnership, establishing the degree of reporting error in sexual partnership dates has important implications for the classification of concurrency in both research and public health practice. We will analyze data from a racially and ethnically diverse sample of young adults aged 18-30 and their sexual partners studied in the Project on Partner Dynamics (POPD) to examine to what extent: 1) a participant's belief that his/her partner has another sexual partner (perceived partner concurrency) predicts the participant's initiation of a concurrent partnership during the following 4 months; 2) sexual partners report the same dates for their first sexual intercourse (anal, oral, or vaginal) and for their last sexual intercourse; and 3) the observed association between perceived partner concurrency and subsequent concurrency initiation is affected by potential error in recall of dates. The POPD study recruited 537 persons from Los Angeles area community sites for a one-year study of heterosexual partnering, including interviewer-administered questionnaires about sexual risk perceptions, intentions, and behaviors at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. At 8- and 12-months, participants were invited to bring a sexual partner for interview. Index and partner respondents were interviewed separately and also jointly, to obtain couple-level answers on selected survey iteMs. We will use generalized estimating equations (GEE) to estimate the association between perceived partner concurrency and subsequent initiation of concurrent behavior over the following 4-months. We will compare reported dates of first and last sexual encounters within the partnership by examining partnership-level agreement, including percent agreement, weighted kappa, and the distribution of differences in reported dates. We will use the observed distribution of differences in a sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of potential reporting error on the classification of concurrency and on the observed association between perception of partner concurrency and subsequent initiation of concurrency. This information on the quality of concurrency measurement has important implications for STI research. Knowledge about predictors of concurrency initiation may provide insights into addressing STI disparities among racial/ethnic minorities.   The fellowship applicant will analyze data from a racially and ethnically diverse sample of young adults aged 18-30 years and their sexual partners, studied in the Project on Partner Dynamics (POPD), to examine to what extent: 1) a participant's belief that his/her partner has another sexual partner (perceived partner concurrency) predicts the participant's initiation of a concurrent partnership during the following 4 months; 2) participants accurately report the beginning and ending dates sexual partnerships; and 3) the impact of likely inaccuracy in reporting of partnership dates on the observed association between perceived partner concurrency and subsequent concurrency initiation.",INITIATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF CONCURRENT PARTNERSHIPS: A LONGITUDINAL STUDY,8476155,F31HD068126,"['Affect ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Coitus ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Fellowship ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Interviewer ', ' Interview ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Literature ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Memory ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Questionnaires ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' Weight ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Measurement ', ' Respondent ', ' Knowledge ', ' Oral ', ' Equation ', ' Participant ', ' Agreement ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' age difference ', ' Reporting ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' risk perception ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' aged ', ' high risk ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' sexual encounter ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2013,31082,0.0626873988101783
"Sexual Orientation and Obesity:  Test of a Gendered Biopsychosocial Model    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant: Sexual Orientation and Obesity: Test of a Gendered Biopsychosocial Model Obesity is one of the most critical public health issues affecting the U.S. today. Racial and socioeconomic disparities in the determinants, distribution, and consequences of obesity are receiving increasing attention; however, one area that is only beginning to be recognized is the striking interplay of gender and sexual orientation in obesity disparities. It is now well-established that women of minority sexual orientation are disproportionately affected by the obesity epidemic, with nearly three-quarters of adult lesbians overweight or obese, compared to half of heterosexual women. In stark contrast, among men, heterosexual males have nearly double the risk of obesity compared to gay males. Despite clear evidence from descriptive epidemiologic research that sexual orientation and gender markedly pattern obesity disparities, there is almost no prospective, analytic epidemiologic research into the causes of these disparities. It will be impossible to develop evidence-based preventive interventions unless we first answer basic questions about causal pathways, as we plan to do. Our study has high potential for public health impact not only for sexual minorities but also for heterosexuals, as we seek to uncover how processes of gender socialization may exacerbate obesity risk in both sexual minority females and heterosexual males. In response to PA-07-409 ""Health Research with Diverse Populations,"" we will rigorously test our innovative gendered biopsychosocial model that is both multilevel and multisystem to explain observed sexual orientation disparities in obesity. We will use longitudinal, repeated measures survey data and also biological data from three youth cohorts: Growing Up Today Study (GUTS) 1 & 2 and National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), all ongoing prospective cohorts that together total over 47,000 youth living throughout the United States.

"Community Mobilization to Improve the HIV/AIDS Continuum of Care Among Black Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV rates are at catastrophic levels among young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). A study in 21 US cities found that 21% of YBMSM aged 18-29 were HIV+, compared to 9% of Latino and 7% of white young MSM (YMSM), and these disparities are worsening. YBMSM are more likely to be HIV-infected, less likely to be aware of their HIV-infection, and less likely to disclose that they are HIV-infected, relative to men of other ethnic/racial groups. HIV+ YBMSM are also less likely than white MSM to be in treatment for HIV and to have undetectable viral loads (VLs). When HIV+ individuals achieve an undetectable VL, their own health improves, and they are also less infectious to others. Getting to that point, however, requires that HIV+ individuals: (1) know their HIV status; (2) link to HIV care; (3) stay in care over time; (4) begin appropriate treatment; and (5) adhere to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We refer to these steps as engagement in the HIV Care Continuum (CC). While these approaches have great potential to reduce HIV incidence, it is estimated that only 25% of HIV+ people in the US have engaged in the CC to the point of having undetectable VLs. Research suggests that HIV+ YBMSM engage in the CC far less than others. A community-level intervention (CLI) to build and mobilize communities of YBMSM to support HIV+ men to engage in the CC, decrease psychosocial barriers and increase psychosocial facilitators to engage in the CC within those communities may be an efficacious approach to prevent HIV transmission and improve health outcomes for YBMSM. This proposal will test the efficacy of such a CLI model, called United Black Element+ (UBE+). UBE+ will be an adaptation of a current CLI, called UBE. UBE has already engaged hundreds of YBMSM in Dallas TX, and it diffuses support for HIV prevention and creates positive social norms around reducing rates of unprotected sex and increasing regular HIV testing by building an empowered, mobilized YBMSM community. UBE+ will be an adaptation and extension of UBE designed to increase YBMSM's engagement in the CC. The aims of this project are: (1) To adapt and expand UBE into UBE+, a multilevel intervention that includes a new focus on increasing engagement in the CC among HIV+YBMSM, including targeting psychosocial barriers and facilitators to engaging in the CC that are experienced in this community (e.g., HIV stigma and social support); (2) To implement UBE+ in Dallas for 3 years in collaboration with a local AIDS Service Organization currently implementing UBE, the Dallas County Health Department, and the Texas Department of State Health Services' (TDSHS) HIV-STD Program; and (3) To evaluate the efficacy of UBE+ in increasing engagement in the CC in Dallas (utilizing Houston as a control community) using 2 independent methods: (a) a longitudinal cohort of HIV+ YBMSM providing data on engagement in care, and experiences of psychosocial and logistic barriers and facilitators to engagement in care; and (b) public health data that the TDSHS independently collects on HIV+ YBMSM's engagement in the CC.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) are contracting HIV at alarmingly high rates that far exceed other ethnic/racial groups. These disparities are not due to increased risk behavior among YBMSM, but seem to result because YBMSM who are sexually active are more likely to encounter infectious partners. YBMSM are more likely to be HIV+, and less likely to be on treatment for HIV, and to have undetectable HIV viral loads (VLs). When HIV+ men achieve an undetectable VL, their own health improves, and they are also less infectious to others. Getting to that point requires that HIV+ individuals go through a number of steps of engaging in the continuum of care (CC), such as obtaining health care for HIV, and taking medications as prescribed. The goal of this project is to develop, implement, and test a community-level intervention to build and mobilize communities of YBMSM (ages 18-29) to support HIV+ men about engaging in the CC. The intervention is called United Black Element+.

"Behavioral and Manufacturing Science to Commercially Develop Fitted Condoms     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A policy statement by the World Health Organization notes that, ""the male latex condom is the single, most efficient, available technology to reduce the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections."" Unfortunately, despite decades of condom promotion efforts, condoms usage rates remain disappointingly low. Between one-third and one-half of men report poor condom fit, and these men are more likely to forego condom use. TheyFit LLC seeks to address this by manufacturing 'custom-fitted' condoms, with 95 different sizes available based on user-determined length and circumference measurements. Currently, only a narrow range of condom sizes are available in the United States due to regulatory guidelines governing manufacturing and testing procedures that require burst tests designed for a narrow range of condom sizes. We seek to conduct laboratory condom testing to increase the evidence base for adopting new draft international standards that establish a model of burst test standards allowing a broader range of condom sizes to be tested. Adoption of expanded testing standards is critical to enabling a wider range of condom sizes to be available in the United States. We also seek to improve upon traditional self-report mechanisms of penis measurement by validating the TheyFit measuring tool. This would address an important research question regarding validated measures and supply information on whether users have sufficient proficiency to accurately determine their custom condom size. To provide reference data for a future clinical trial, we will analyze data, previously collected from a national sample of men who have sex with men, to establish condom breakage rates for anal sex. This analysis will provide innovation by allowing further research to move condoms towards being regulated medical devices for anal sex. On both grants, TheyFit will work in collaboration with faculty in Emory University's Department of Epidemiology, who have extensive expertise conducting research regarding HIV/AIDS among sexual minority populations. The proposed research has potential to inform efforts aimed at reducing HIV-related disparities and reducing new HIV infections, meeting two priority areas identified in the Strategic Plan of the NIH Office of AIDS Research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Condoms are the most efficient and available technology for preventing HIV transmission, but many men don't use condoms and report problems with poorly fitting condoms. The proposed research seeks to contribute to tools and standards development that would allow for a larger range of condom sizes to be available to men in the United States. Having an expanded range of condom sizes made available is a promising strategy in increasing condom usage, particularly in high-risk populations.                ",Behavioral and Manufacturing Science to Commercially Develop Fitted Condoms,8603309,R43HD078154,"['Adoption ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' European Community ', ' European Union ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Industry ', ' Laboratories ', ' Latex ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', ' Medical Device ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' penis ', ' pressure ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sales ', ' Science ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Standardization ', ' great pox ', ' Syphilis ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time Study ', ' United States ', ' USFDA ', ' Food and Drug Administration ', ' United States Food and Drug Administration ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Anal Sex ', ' tool ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Adopted ', ' Width ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' condoms ', ' novel ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Agreement ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' International ', ' NIH Office of AIDS Research ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' sexual minority ', ' ']",NICHD,"THEYFIT, LLC",R43,2013,215058,0.03709137867952833
"Relationship Disruption during Incarceration and HIV Risk in African American Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men released from prison face disproportionate HIV risk. Preventing HIV sexual risk behavior and drug use in this group is critical to reducing the race disparity in HIV. However, research on the factors that drive and protect against HIV risk among African American male releasees is limited. Returning to a committed partner after release may be an important protective factor against HIV risk among African American male releasees during reentry. However, incarceration destabilizes committed relationships. Though 50-80% of men enter prison in a committed relationship, we estimate that half of these relationships end by the time of release. Upon release, loss of a partner may lead men to seek multiple, new partners to meet companionship needs or may lead to distress and, in turn, self-medication with drugs or sex. No prior study has evaluated the degree to which partner loss during incarceration influences post-release HIV risk. The present mixed method study is designed to address this gap in the current field of HIV prevention science. This study seeks to examine the hypothesis that dissolution of stable intimate relationships during incarceration elevates sexual risk behavior and drug use among inmates upon their release. The specific aims are: Primary Quantitative Aims: Aim 1. Among African American men in relationships at the time of prison entry, to describe the associations between dissolution of relationships during incarceration and HIV sexual risk behavior (unprotected sex; multiple sex partnerships; buying sex for money or drugs) and drug use (crack use; binge drinking). Aim 2. To assess whether diminished mental health (low coping; increased depression; increased anxiety) due to dissolution of relationships during incarceration results in HIV sexual risk behavior and drug use. Aim 3. To evaluate whether the association between dissolution of relationships during incarceration and HIV sexual risk behavior and drug use varies by respondent and relationship characteristics. Qualitative Aim: To qualitatively explore the social context of post-release and men's perceptions of the factors and processes driving post-release sexual risk behavior and drug use. To accomplish these study aims, we propose to recruit 400 African American male inmates who are scheduled to be released from prison and who were in stable intimate heterosexual relationships at the time of prison entry. Our pilot work suggests that ~50% of relationships will have ended during the incarceration. We will follow men after their release to assess whether post-release sexual risk behavior and drug use are higher among men whose relationships ended during incarceration versus men whose relationships remained intact. The proposed study is designed to inform development of policies and interventions that minimize the destabilizing effects of criminal justice involvement on relationships and health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Since more than 800,000 African American men are incarcerated in prison at any given time, and hundreds of thousands return home to their communities each year, policies and programs that are effective in reducing HIV risk in this group would prevent substantial numbers of new infections among African American men and members of their sexual networks annually. This research will determine whether dissolution of committed relationships during incarceration is a risk factor for post-release HIV sexual risk behavior and drug use among African American male releasees and will describe the pathways through which relationship dissolution may work to influence HIV risk. Study findings may highlight the need for implementation of criminal justice policies that reduce network disruption and may inform HIV prevention interventions, including in-prison programs for inmates and their partners that foster communication and prevent relationship dissolution, and pre-release HIV prevention education for men who have lost a committed partner during incarceration.

"Social and structural context of HIV/STI risk among FSWs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this application is to use social epidemiological methods to prospectively evaluate the impact of social, environmental, and structural factors on partner-level sexual and drug risk patterns and HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence among FSWs and to assess the feasibility of a subsequent HIV/STI intervention targeting FSWs in public place-based settings (e.g. bars, streets). Despite growing evidence of the effectiveness of environmental-structural HIV/STI interventions targeting FSWs, this research has been largely derived from developing country settings and establishment-based venues, and there is limited prospective data on the social and structural context of HIV/STI risk among FSWs in North America. Given recent reports suggest a temporal shift from an injection to a sexually-driven HIV epidemic among street-involved populations in many North American settings, there is a crucial need for more prospective data on the contextual factors promoting and constraining partner-level sexual and drug risk patterns and HIV/STI acquisition. Vancouver, Canada is ideally suited for the proposed study for several reasons. First, due to the quasi-criminalized nature of sex work and large informal tolerance zones, we are in a unique position to evaluate the context of HIV/STI risk among FSWs, not currently feasible in most US cities. Second, unlike many urban environments where the FSW community is fragmented, the current social and legal context of sex work in Canada, our ability to harness strong community FSW support for this application, and new supportive housing models currently operating legally as quasi-brothels demonstrate significant innovation and strong potential for a subsequent intervention stemming from the results of this research. Herein we propose to create an open prospective cohort of 500 active FSWs working in public place-based settings, including interview administered questionnaires and HIV/STI screening at baseline and 6monthly follow-up over a five year period. To our knowledge this study is among the first prospective studies of public place-based sex work in North America and as such, we will be uniquely positioned to evaluate the risk environment and temporal trends in partner-level risks and HIV/STI acquisition among FSWs. This research will address several questions central to the urgent challenges facing HIV/STI prevention capacity in North America and will directly assess the feasibility of a subsequent intervention that will be of critical importance to other developed country settings.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While there is growing concern in many North American cities of a temporal shift from an injection to a sexually-driven HIV epidemic, there has been limited prospective evaluation of the broader risk environment and HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence among FSWs. Using social epidemiological methods, this research will address this gap by evaluating the impact of the physical and social environment, gender inequities, and structural factors on partner-level sexual and drug risk patterns and HIV/STI acquisition among an open cohort of 500 FSWs.

"Exploring Patterns of Concurrency Among Urban African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed K-01 career development award explores patterns of concurrent sexual partnerships, or partnerships that overlap in time, among urban African Americans in Philadelphia. I am an Assistant Professor of Medicine (Research) in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Brown University Medical School. I hope to use the K-01 award to transition from health policy to behavioral and social science research in HIV/AIDS prevention. My long-term career goals are to pursue an academic career in order to conduct behavioral and sociological research in the field of HIV/AIDS, to publish articles in the peer- reviewed literature, and conduct HIV/AIDS research that influences public policy. I hope to use the K01 award to learn how to conduct community-based participatory research (CPBR), develop new quantitative skills for behavioral science research, acquire expertise in behavioral research for HIV prevention and HIV intervention research, and gain expertise in health disparities research and ethical conduct of research in underserved populations. The research components of my application follow: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches will be employed to explore 32-40 African American community leaders' opinions and knowledge about sexual concurrency and other factors contributing to HIV health disparities among urban African Americans. CBPR will also be used to examine African American community leaders' interest in developing and piloting novel interventions to address concurrent sexual relationships and other factors contributing to HIV health disparities among African Americans. Subsequently, differential rates of sexual concurrency and other factors that may contribute to racial disparities in HIV rates among African Americans testing for HIV in Philadelphia will be explored. This analysis will rely on secondary survey data collected during Philadelphia's rapid testing campaign, which tests approximately 6,000 people annually. The beliefs, attitudes, practices, patterns and causes of concurrent sexual partnerships will then be explored through 80 in-depth qualitative interviews among HIV- negative African American men and women testing for HIV in Philadelphia. In keeping with the CBPR framework guiding this study, the findings of each of the aforementioned research projects will be shared and explored with African American community leaders and the Philadelphia community at large. Community input about the study findings, appropriate interpretations, interventions, and public policy suggestions will be solicited. The findings from the aforementioned studies will then be used to design an R01 grant application proposing an HIV prevention intervention. The intervention will combine behavioral and social interventions to address concurrent sexual partnerships, and may aim to increase condom use rates with main and non-main partners, reduce concurrent sexual partners, or address other factors contributing to HIV health disparities among HIV-negative African Americans.

"Development of the vaginal microbiome in young Black women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this research is to understand the developmental composition, function, and correlates of the vaginal microbiome in young Black women. This focus is justified because of the substantial sexual health and reproductive health disparities of Black women compared to women of other racial/ethnic groups. No research traces the evolution of the vaginal microbiome of Black women from adolescence into young adulthood. This is a developmental interval characterized by new vaginal hygiene practices (e.g., douching, tampon/pad use), changes in diet and physical activity, partnered sexual activity, hormonal and barrier contraceptive use, and sexually transmitted infections. The potential impact of the project would be to inform public health interventions intended to reduce sexual and reproductive health disparities among Black women.  We propose to assemble a prospective cohort of 180 healthy Black, post-menarchal 14 year-old adolescent women. Vaginal swabs will be self-obtained monthly for up to 24 months. Vaginal microbiome composition will be assessed by phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences. Vaginal microbiome function will be assessed by periodic assessment of vaginal pH and Nugent score, as well as quantification of salivary estrogen and vaginal glycogen. Nutritional correlates will be assessed with measurement of plasma 25- hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) status. Sexual behavior and reproductive health correlates of the vaginal microbiome will be assessed using electronic daily diaries. STI correlates will be diagnosed prospectively with nucleic acid amplifications tests. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The knowledge gained from this study addresses sexual and reproductive health disparities of Black women, including sexually transmitted infections, human immunodeficiency virus infections, and low birth weight. The research will fill gaps in existing knowledge, will bring a missing developmental focus to understanding of the vaginal microbiome, and will guide new clinical and public health approaches to the sexual and reproductive health of Black women.",Development of the vaginal microbiome in young Black women,8898465,R56AI108775,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Coitus ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Electronics ', ' Environment ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17-diol (17beta)- ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estradiol ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogenic Compounds ', ' Estrogenic Agents ', ' Estrogens ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Evolution ', ' Glycogen ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hygiene ', ' low birthweight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birth weight ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' Lactobacillus ', ' Menarche ', ' Persons ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' preservation ', ' Biologic Preservation ', ' Biological Preservation ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Ribosomal RNA Genes ', ' rRNA Genes ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Tampons ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Woman ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' base ', ' Nucleic Acid Testing ', ' Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests ', ' Vaginal Lavage ', ' Vaginal Irrigation ', ' Douching ', ' Vaginal Douching ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Physical activity ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Measurement ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Lubricants ', ' Knowledge ', ' diaries ', ' Oral ', ' Salivary ', ' Pattern ', ' Hormonal ', ' 25-hydroxyvitamin D ', ' psychosocial ', ' urogenital system (genital part) ', ' Genital ', ' Genital system ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Swab ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' microbiome ', ' Human Microbiome ', ' comparison group ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' fourteen year old ', ' age 14 years ', ' 14 year old ', ' microbial community ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' young woman ', ' ']",NIAID,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R56,2014,772643,0.013817065488180512

However, current research has shown that post-rape services are not reaching young unmarried women between the ages 15 to 24 in the region. Young women of this age are highly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, particularly after a traumatic event such as an incident of SGBV. This study will investigate how microfinance affects the mental health and HIV sexual risk behavior of young unmarried women within an existing study.  Research participants will be asked to self-report HIV sexual risk behavior in a series of survey questions. Risk behaviors such as multiple sexual partners and condom usage will be measured at baseline, and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-baseline. A secondary data analysis will be conducted comparing HIV sexual risk behavior with demographic and mental health measures over time. Although sexual risk behavior data will be collected for 500 women in both the microfinance intervention group (n=250) compared to the delayed control group (n=250), this study will focus on the effects of microfinance on HIV sexual risk behaviors of young unmarried women between the ages of 15-24. It is hypothesized that young unmarried women in the intervention group will report fewer sexual risk behaviors than women in the delayed control group.  In-depth qualitative interviews with a subsample of young unmarried women (n=50, five from each of the ten villages) will explore reasons behind status of health, mental health, and HIV sexual risk behavior. Of particular interest in these interviews is the relationship between conflict-setting and SGBV trauma, a microfinance intervention, and sexual risk behavioral outcomes. Interviews will be conducted at baseline and 18 months post-intervention to compare the types of responses and evaluate the impact of microfinance in the lives of young unmarried women with regards to coping with traumatic experiences and impact on HIV sexual risk behaviors. Collaboration between the study investigator and local Congolese experts trained in sensitive (to SGBV survivors) research methods will explore how trauma survivors view microfinance and if microfinance has affected their sexual risk behaviors. Acknowledging safety concerns for participants and researchers in this conflict setting, every precaution will be taken through the complex safety system that Congolese partners have developed over the past fifteen years of successfully working in this conflict setting. Interviews will take place in a safe participant-selected setting for 90 minutes, asking open-ended questions, and only exploring what young women are comfortable with.           This study investigates how microfinance affects the mental health outcomes and HIV/AIDS sexual risk behaviors of young unmarried women participating in an existing research study in the post-conflict setting of Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Mixed-methods (quantitative and qualitative) research will explore how young female trauma survivors are affected by a microfinance intervention and the intervention's impact on sexual risk behaviors.

"Community Mobilization to Improve the HIV/AIDS Continuum of Care Among Black Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV rates are at catastrophic levels among young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). A study in 21 US cities found that 21% of YBMSM aged 18-29 were HIV+, compared to 9% of Latino and 7% of white young MSM (YMSM), and these disparities are worsening. YBMSM are more likely to be HIV-infected, less likely to be aware of their HIV-infection, and less likely to disclose that they are HIV-infected, relative to men of other ethnic/racial groups. HIV+ YBMSM are also less likely than white MSM to be in treatment for HIV and to have undetectable viral loads (VLs). When HIV+ individuals achieve an undetectable VL, their own health improves, and they are also less infectious to others. Getting to that point, however, requires that HIV+ individuals: (1) know their HIV status; (2) link to HIV care; (3) stay in care over time; (4) begin appropriate treatment; and (5) adhere to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We refer to these steps as engagement in the HIV Care Continuum (CC). While these approaches have great potential to reduce HIV incidence, it is estimated that only 25% of HIV+ people in the US have engaged in the CC to the point of having undetectable VLs. Research suggests that HIV+ YBMSM engage in the CC far less than others. A community-level intervention (CLI) to build and mobilize communities of YBMSM to support HIV+ men to engage in the CC, decrease psychosocial barriers and increase psychosocial facilitators to engage in the CC within those communities may be an efficacious approach to prevent HIV transmission and improve health outcomes for YBMSM. This proposal will test the efficacy of such a CLI model, called United Black Element+ (UBE+). UBE+ will be an adaptation of a current CLI, called UBE. UBE has already engaged hundreds of YBMSM in Dallas TX, and it diffuses support for HIV prevention and creates positive social norms around reducing rates of unprotected sex and increasing regular HIV testing by building an empowered, mobilized YBMSM community. UBE+ will be an adaptation and extension of UBE designed to increase YBMSM's engagement in the CC. The aims of this project are: (1) To adapt and expand UBE into UBE+, a multilevel intervention that includes a new focus on increasing engagement in the CC among HIV+YBMSM, including targeting psychosocial barriers and facilitators to engaging in the CC that are experienced in this community (e.g., HIV stigma and social support); (2) To implement UBE+ in Dallas for 3 years in collaboration with a local AIDS Service Organization currently implementing UBE, the Dallas County Health Department, and the Texas Department of State Health Services' (TDSHS) HIV-STD Program; and (3) To evaluate the efficacy of UBE+ in increasing engagement in the CC in Dallas (utilizing Houston as a control community) using 2 independent methods: (a) a longitudinal cohort of HIV+ YBMSM providing data on engagement in care, and experiences of psychosocial and logistic barriers and facilitators to engagement in care; and (b) public health data that the TDSHS independently collects on HIV+ YBMSM's engagement in the CC.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) are contracting HIV at alarmingly high rates that far exceed other ethnic/racial groups. These disparities are not due to increased risk behavior among YBMSM, but seem to result because YBMSM who are sexually active are more likely to encounter infectious partners. YBMSM are more likely to be HIV+, and less likely to be on treatment for HIV, and to have undetectable HIV viral loads (VLs). When HIV+ men achieve an undetectable VL, their own health improves, and they are also less infectious to others. Getting to that point requires that HIV+ individuals go through a number of steps of engaging in the continuum of care (CC), such as obtaining health care for HIV, and taking medications as prescribed. The goal of this project is to develop, implement, and test a community-level intervention to build and mobilize communities of YBMSM (ages 18-29) to support HIV+ men about engaging in the CC. The intervention is called United Black Element+. The study is being conducted in Dallas and Houston, Texas.

"Probability-based survey of HIV risk among transmen using a novel sampling method     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study seeks to address two pressing scientific needs: 1) to improve ways to sample and recruit hard-to-reach minority populations for inclusion in research and 2) to fill a gap in our knowledge of the health problems faced by female-to-male transgender persons (transmen). Minority populations unduly suffer from many diseases and mental health conditions; sexual minorities bear a particularly heavy burden of the HIV epidemic. We are seeing warning signs that transmen may be an overlooked minority population at high risk for HIV, with documented AIDS and STD cases, sex partners who are gay men and male-to-female transgender persons (transwomen) and low condom use. Transmen also appear to face discrimination and have high levels of drug and alcohol use, depression and suicide. However, reliable data are lacking to guide prevention and care programs. This exploratory study will develop and test a novel strategy to sample and recruit transmen for a survey of HIV prevalence and health risks, beginning with outreach to public places where transmen are found followed by referral of their peers. Although this study focuses on transmen, our research will invent and validate a new sampling method applicable to diverse populations affected by HIV and other health issues worldwide.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Transmen may be at high risk for HIV infection yet there is an extreme paucity of accurate data from representative samples. The primary significance of this proposed R21 is that it will develop and apply a new sampling method to obtain more representative health data on transmen. Our strategy is to assess the theoretical assumptions underlying venue-outreach and peer-referral sampling methods and combine their advantages in the field. We anticipate findings of this exploratory study will be immediately applicable to advocate for HIV prevention resources, develop appropriate new interventions and guide future research on this marginalized population. Our study also stands to enhance the inclusion and representation of other minority populations in research and provide more rigorous data from groups experiencing diverse health disparities.                    ",Probability-based survey of HIV risk among transmen using a novel sampling method,8643814,R21HD071765,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Behavior ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Hybrids ', ' male ', ' Maps ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Population Sizes ', ' Probability ', ' Records ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' seed ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Seeds ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Societies ', ' sea star ', ' Asteroidea ', ' Starfish ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Diffuse ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Gays ', ' Respondent ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' transsexual ', ' transgender ', ' experience ', ' condoms ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Categories ', ' outreach ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' Behavioral ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' time use ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Guide prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' stem ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' sexual minority ', ' LGBTI ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex ', ' ']",NICHD,SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R21,2014,162313,0.012517234686482692
"CB1 Receptor PET Imaging Reveals Gender Differencesin PTSD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the widely acknowledged gender differences in the prevalence and clinical course of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), there exists a paucity of data on the neurobiological mechanisms that explain these reported gender disparities in PTSD; therefore, better understanding of neurobiological sex differences has the potential to provide understanding of the neurobiology of PTSD and will also lead to improving interventions and services for males and females. We propose to recruit N=12 medication-free female patients with civilian PTSD, measure their CB1 receptor-selective radioligand [11C]OMAR volumes of distribution (VT), an equivalent of CB1 receptor expression using PET and compare them with 12 men with PTSD, as well as individually age, gender and BMI-matched controls with (TC, N=24) and without (HC, N=24) trauma history.

"Gender Disparities in High-Risk PITC: The Role of Policy on Provider Practices     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed fellowship will prepare the applicant for a research career focused on HIV policies and their implementation in practice. A comprehensive training plan accompanies the proposed study and has the following objectives: (1) develop knowledge of both HIV policies and the implementation of HIV testing protocols in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA); (2) increase methodological capacity in surveys, in-depth interviews, and policy discourse analysis; and (3) publish and present research findings. The specific focus of the proposed study is to examine men's underutilization of HIV testing, and thus life-prolonging treatment. Men constitute the majority of AIDS-related morbidity and mortality in SSA even though they are less likely than women to be infected. A primary contributor to men's high rate of AIDS-related mortality is their failure to access HIV testing: in Malawi, where the study will be conducted, men comprise only 33% those tested for HIV. A common explanation is that men are more reluctant than women to learn their HIV status due to concerns that a positive status would compromise their masculinity. A plausible additional explanation is structural rather than individual: as a result of feminized policies that emphasize women's excess vulnerability to HIV, healthcare providers offer fewer HIV testing services to men than women. In Malawi, virtually all women seeking antenatal care are tested for HIV, but men must specifically request testing. Yet even in venues where all clients should be offered HIV testing, as is the case for Malawians with TB or sexually transmitted infections (STIs), men are less likely to be tested. A possible explanation could be that feminized HIV policies affect how providers interact with male versus female clients. Although studies in high-income countries show that feminized sexual health policies can lead providers to offer fewer health services to men than women, there are no equivalent studies in the high HIV-prevalence countries of SSA. The proposed study in Malawi will be the first to examine if HIV policy influences providers' perceptions of gender and HIV, and whether this affects providers' implementation of HIV testing protocols for TB and STI clients. The study has three aims: (1) To use policy discourse analysis to examine how men and women are portrayed in HIV policy, using as texts both national policies and provider-training materials; (2) To collect and analyze data from in-depth interviews with healthcare providers to assess whether there are differences in their perceptions of male and female clients; (3) To collect and analyze data from exit surveys with TB and STI clients to test whether providers offer HIV testing differently to male versus female clients. Findings from the three aims will be examined together through mixed methods analysis in order to explore the relationship between HIV policy, provider perceptions, and provider implementation of HIV testing protocols. Findings will have implications for HIV policies and can inform interventions designed to increase men's use of HIV services. The project aligns with the mission and objectives of NIMH by addressing the causes of disparities in HIV service utilization among high-risk groups.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project has the potential to improve public health by addressing a likely structural barrier to men's use of HIV testing, and thus their access to life-prolonging treatment. By examining the unintended consequences of HIV policy on the implementation HIV testing protocols, the project will inform policy recommendations for increasing men's use of testing, which has implications for both HIV prevention and AIDS treatment. The project will also provide insight into how provider perceptions affect their implementation of policy, information that can inform the development of future provider-training materials.            ",Gender Disparities in High-Risk PITC: The Role of Policy on Provider Practices,8789975,F31MH103078,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Client ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Fellowship ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Nyasaland ', ' Malawi ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Health Policy ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Postnatal Care ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Training ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' HIV risk ', ' Regulation ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Consequences of HIV ', ' International ', ' Policy Research ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' implementation research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' service utilization ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' tuberculosis therapy ', ' TB treatment ', ' TB therapy ', ' tuberculosis treatment ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,F31,2014,34351,0.07635485947563606
"Social Contexts, Sexual Networks, and Racial-Ethnic Disparities in STDs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research component of this project explores how racial-ethnic segregation and inequality shape sexual networks and the spread of sexually transmitted disease (STD). Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health), I will explore how racial- ethnic segregation and inequality at the school- and neighborhood-levels influence the formation of sexual partnerships. Applying parameter estimates from the Add Health to simulated sexual networks, I will then assess how sexual networks and disease diffusion may progress differently in settings with varying population compositions and patterns of racial-ethnic inequality. Informed by structural sociological theory, this research takes an interdisciplinary approach and applies testable social science hypotheses to problems of infectious disease epidemiology. Through relationships with mentors and advisors, coursework, and participation in professional seminars, the training component of this project would allow me to expand my work on health disparities to include (i) greater attention to social contexts and networks as determinants of health, and (ii) new types of contagious health outcomes. There are three career development objectives for the proposed project: (i) obtain skills and expertise in infectious disease epidemiology and network analysis; (ii) conduct original research on racial-ethnic STD disparities in the U.S.; and (iii) prepare a major grant to support an independent research program in social networks, health disparities, and infectious disease.           There are large racial-ethnic disparities in sexually transmitted diseases in the United States. This project explores how racial-ethnic segregation and inequality across schools and neighborhoods shape the structure of sexual networks, and how differences in sexual networks may lead to different epidemic outcomes in communities with varying racial-ethnic and socioeconomic make-ups.

"The Hampton University regional Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hampton University, as the lead institution for the Hampton University (HU)-Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Transdisiplinary Collaborative Center (TCC) for research on men's health, will take a comprehensive approach to narrowing the gender gap of health disparities by harnessing the resources and expertise of eight historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to collaborate in implementing and advancing innovative transdisciplinary research that includes intervention components of research, education and outreach, and training to effectively reduce health disparities in minority men. The primary objective of the HU-HBCU TCC will be to reduce selected health disparities in minority men. It will be achieved through four specific aims: (1) Create a transparent and full participatory coalition of partners to collaboratively design, implement, evaluate and disseminate innovative transdisciplinary programs to reduce health disparities in men; (2) establish four cores and a pilot project program (Administrative, Collaborations and Partnerships, Research, Pilot Projects and Intervention Implementation) to support proposed subprojects and pilot projects, as well as, future research activities;(3) implement a sustainable and transferrable collaborative research model in six areas (cancer; cardiovascular disease, violence prevention and diabetes, obesity, melanoma) to positively influence and health outcomes of minority men; and (4) evaluate research, implementation, and dissemination activities to promote optimal use of the TCCs resources by HBCUs, government, community partners and other vital stakeholders. The potential impact of activities resulting from the HU-HBCU TCC will address the NIH Health Disparities Strategic Plan 2009-2013 as it will harness the resources and expertise of HBCUs to collaborate in implementing and advancing innovative transdisciplinary research. In addition, the proposed research that will be conducted by the HU-HBCU TCC is especially relevant to public health as its major focus includes intervention components of research, education and outreach, and training to effectively and efficiently reduce health disparities in minority men. The interdisciplinary research design and methods to achieve the goal and specific aims involve bringing together, scientists, researchers and community representatives to positively impact the health and well-being of minority men by establishing and implementing sub-projects and pilot projects with a regional focus. This proposed coordinated transdisciplinary approach to reduce and ultimately eliminate health disparities will also enable the participating partners to leverage resources and enhance collaboration.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed HU-HBCU TCC Project is especially relevant as it proposes to develop research models that will be both sustainable and transferable across communities, regions in the nation. While the preponderance of research efforts to improve health outcomes has tended to focus on research and treatment for education and awareness, we are confident that our innovative comprehensive approach will be more effective and efficient.                      ",The Hampton University regional Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center,8699834,U54MD008621,"['Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' melanoma ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Universities ', ' Gender ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' prevent violence ', ' violence prevention ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' implementation research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', "" men's health "", ' male health ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIMHD,HAMPTON UNIVERSITY,U54,2014,3048084,0.038848821088834314
"Male Incarceration, the Health Care Service Environment and Sexual Health Project Summary/Abstract Compared to areas with low rates of incarceration, areas with higher rates of incarceration have higher and increasing rates of sexually transmitted infections (hereafter STIs).[1,2] One study also found a statistically significant association between rates of male incarceration and rates of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).[1] Few studies have examined these relationships and even fewer studies have been conducted to explore the reasons for these higher rates.  This proposed mixed-method study will use the Social Cognitive Theory and the Social Ecological Model to fill this critical gap. The following three research aims seek to look beyond the individual and consider environmental contextual factors: Aim 1: Using qualitative methods, examine and compare the processes through which male: female sex ratios influence sexual networks and partnership formation and maintenance among heterosexual African-American women living in two types of census tracts: a tract that has higher male incarceration rates and a tract that has lower male incarceration rates; Aim 2: Investigate the relationship between male incarceration rates and rates of HIV and other STIs in Atlanta census tracts over time (2005- 2010); Aim 3: Explore health care service availability as a moderator of the relationship between rates of male incarceration and rates of HIV and other STIs. The long term objective of this study is to gain a greater understanding of how male incarceration rates and the health care service environment influence individuallevel sexual and reproductive health. The information gained by achieving the aims of this study could be used to inform the development of programs and policies aimed at mitigating the adverse impact of rates of male incarceration on the transmission of HIV and other STIs.  The principal investigator (hereafter PI) will use qualitative methods to achieve Aim 1 and quantitative methods to achieve Aims 2 and 3. Qualitative methods are best suited to address Aim 1 because these methods are particularly useful for understanding contextual influences and also for discovery,[3-5] both of which are important for emerging research on the macro-social determinants of STIs and HIV. The PI will interview women from two Atlanta, GA census tracts, one that has a high male incarceration rate and a low male: female sex ratio, and the other that has a low male incarceration rate and a male: female sex ratio close to 1.00. Interviews will focus on sexual networks and romantic partnership formation and maintenance. To achieve Aims 2 and 3, U.S. decennial data, STI and HIV/AIDS surveillance data, incarceration data and an inventory of health care service locations will be used to analyze the relationship between incarceration rates and STI/HIV rates in Atlanta GA census tracts, and to investigate whether spatial access to healthcare moderates these relationships. Geographic Information Software (GIS), PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS) and Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) software will be used in these analyses. Rates of HIV and other STIs are at epidemic proportions in African American populations in the U.S.[6,7] There have been calls in the literature, from the CDC and from the White House's National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States report for future studies to examine (1) how incarceration within African American communities affects HIV-risk behaviors among the sexual partners and sexual networks of those left behind and in the community at large;[8-10] (2) health care availability and sexual networks in relation to HIV and other STI health disparities.[11] The information obtained from this study could be used to inform the development of programs and policies aimed at mitigating the adverse impact of rates of male incarceration on the transmission of HIV and other STIs.","Male Incarceration, the Health Care Service Environment and Sexual Health",8611971,F31MH096630,"['abstracting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Censuses ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' LAV-2 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 2 ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type IV ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 2 ', ' HTLV-IV ', ' HIV2 ', ' HIV-II ', ' HIV-2 ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Linear Models ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Prisons ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Sex Ratio ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Life ', ' Location ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' experience ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Jail ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' surveillance data ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' ']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2014,18056,0.04976314505099253
"Health-Seeking Behaviors among Men with Criminal Justice and Substance Abuse Hist The proposed training program will focus on cancer risks, screening behaviors and preventive health care among men returning to the community after incarceration. Individuals who have extensive criminal justice histories have disproportionately high rates of smoking, greater burden of viral infections associated with cancer (e.g., hepatitis, HPV, HIV) and greater barriers to establishing and obtaining routine health care. Although efforts are underway to connect people to health care settings upon release, there is an absence of evidence about men's health-seeking behaviors after returning to the community. Little is known about men's motivations and intentions to participate in screening, prevention or treatment, or about contextual factors that affect their health behavior.    A five year research and training program is proposed to prepare the principal investigator for a career in cancer-health disparities and participatory health services research focused on socially-marginalized, at-risk groups, such as former prisoners. The candidate's long-term goals are to advance her skills in community-partnered research, research design and psychometric development of measures. This program will build upon her strong background in HIV/AIDS, community practice and qualitative research, by providing a deeper understanding of factors that foster cancer-related health disparities among men with histories of criminal justice and substance abuse problems. Specific training objectives are: 1) to become proficient in the development, design, and use of psychometrically-sound instruments to measure health-seeking behavior among high-risk, socioeconomically disadvantaged men; 2) to gain experience with participatory research methods, in order to maximize former offenders' involvement in research and engagement in interventions to increase their use of needed health services; 3) to learn about the design of multilevel health services interventions, in order to create a program focusing on ethnic minority men with extensive criminal justice and substance abuse histories, and; 4) to develop an understanding of the ethical issues that enter into health services research among people recently released from the criminal justice system.    Structured training activities involve coursework in methodology, psychometrics/scale development, biostatistics, epidemiology, bioethics, advanced data analysis, and correctional health research. Mentors and advisors will provide additional readings, research supervision and consultation. The research and training activities will be pursued through the Division of Community Collaboration and Implementation Science in the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine with senior researchers in a number of institutions including Columbia University and the University of Michigan. This training will provide an important foundation for collaborative planning of evidence-based community health services for this population.    The proposed research will examine the health-related needs and health-seeking behaviors of 300 men ages 35-64 that have criminal justice and substance abuse histories in New York City. Specific aims are: 1) to explore unmet health and psychosocial needs and quality of life among ethnic minority men who have extensive criminal justice and substance histories; 2) to assess health-seeking behaviors among these men, including influences on their decisions to participate in cancer screening, prevention and treatment; 3) to describe contextual barriers and facilitators that affect men's use of services; and 4) to evaluate the reliability and validity of instruments developed or adapted for use with men with criminal justice and substance use histories. In addition to characterizing men's health concerns, this study will describe barriers and facilitators to seeking care and treatment as well as the complex set of circumstances (e.g. health/illness, parenting, vocational skills, housing stability, employment, and social support) that may impede men's ability to prioritize their health care needs.    Research and training activities described in this proposal are intended to develop the community connections, preliminary data and research skills necessary for the candidate to launch an independent program of community intervention research, designed to improve health and well-being and reduce cancer burden among vulnerable and largely disenfranchised segments of our society. Public Health Relevance. The proposed K01 Research Scientist Development Award title, ""Health Seeking among Men with Criminal Justice and Substance Abuse Histories"" has serious relevance to public health agenda and priorities. Of the 7.3 million adults who are under some form of correctional supervision (e.g., probation, parole, prison and jail inmates), ethnic minority men are four times as likely than whites and nearly 2.5 times as likely to be under correctional supervision[40]. Nationwide, many states are recognizing that chronic and infectious diseases are concentrated in correctional populations and the punitive responses to nonviolent offenders are no longer a viable, economical option. Once these men return to the community, men who have extensive  criminal justice and substance abuse histories often have unequal or lack access to health care services and fail to continue treatments that were initiated during incarceration[42]. Not only do ex-offenders report a wide array of problems and unmet health needs, but cancer-health disparities also exist. The proposed study contributes to the area of cancer-health disparities research and is consistent with NCI's strategic plan to chart the risk trajectories that may contribute to cancer and other adverse health  conditions among vulnerable and disadvantaged populations.",Health-Seeking Behaviors among Men with Criminal Justice and Substance Abuse Hist,8698341,K01CA154861,"['adulthood ', '

"Ectopic adiposity in black men with high type 2 diabetes risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) disproportionately affect black individuals. Generalized obesity and other established risk factors do not explain the racial disparity in T2D, and this is particularly evident among men. Emerging evidence indicates that fat accumulation in non-adipose tissues (referred to as ectopic adiposity) may be associated with T2D, independent of general obesity. Compared to white men, both obese and lean black men have less visceral and liver adiposity, while in contrast, they paradoxically have more skeletal muscle adiposity. Skeletal muscle is crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis, and thus, skeletal muscle adiposity may be the key adipose tissue depot contributing to increased T2D risk in blacks. However, much remains to be learned about the epidemiology of skeletal muscle adiposity, particularly among high-risk black populations. Through the K01 (DK083029) and R03 (DK092348) funded pilot studies for new investigators, the applicant has begun to investigate the epidemiology of skeletal muscle adiposity and other ectopic adipose tissue depots in a well-characterized, large cohort of black men from the Tobago Health Study. This cohort offers a unique opportunity to study a black population with low levels of total adiposity, and low prevalence of other potential confounding variables, but with a high prevalence of T2D, especially among non- obese men. We are proposing to continue and expand upon our preliminary research on ectopic adiposity in this cohort. We will take advantage of our unique resource of archived computed tomography (CT) scan image files from over 1500 black men, aged 40 years and above, to analyze skeletal muscle adiposity changes over an average of nearly 7 years, and characterize the natural history of skeletal muscle adiposity changes with aging in black men, and the temporal relationship of these changes with glucose and insulin homeostasis. We will also use archived biological specimens to measure physiologic markers of potential importance for skeletal muscle adiposity, and test several compelling hypotheses about the etiology and consequences of skeletal muscle adiposity. In addition, we will obtain new CT measures of visceral, liver, abdominal muscle and pericardial adiposity, and will test for an association of abdominal skeletal muscle adiposity with measures of glucose and insulin homeostasis, and determine if these associations are independent of liver, visceral and pericardial adiposity. The proposed study will greatly advance our understanding of ectopic adiposity and its role in T2D among high risk black men.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are escalating at alarming rates and disproportionately affect black individuals. Generalized obesity and other established risk factors do not explain the racial disparity in T2D, and this is particularly evident among men Emerging evidence indicates that fat accumulation in non-adipose tissues (referred to as ectopic adiposity) may be associated with T2D, independent of generalized obesity. In particular, skeletal muscle adiposity may be the key adipose tissue depot contributing to increased T2D risk in blacks. However, many important questions about the epidemiology of skeletal muscle adiposity remain unanswered, particularly among high-risk black men. We are proposing to continue and expand our research in a large, well-characterized high-risk cohort of black men, and address the following aims: characterize the natural history of skeletal muscle adiposity changes with aging in black men, and the temporal relationship of these changes with glucose and insulin homeostasis; test several compelling hypotheses about the etiology and consequences of skeletal muscle adiposity; and test for an association of abdominal skeletal muscle adiposity with measures of glucose and insulin homeostasis, independent of other ectopic adipose tissue depots.

"Computer-based HIV Prevention for Seropositive Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexual transmission is the predominant route of HIV infection in the United States, and it is men who are primarily spreading the virus. Male-to-male sexual contact accounts for 72% of all new HIV infections in men while heterosexual contact accounts for 83% of all new HIV infections in women. Extrapolating this incidence data reveals that 75% of all new HIV cases result from high risk sexual activity by men. These new infections are also not evenly distributed throughout the population. African Americans comprise only 14% of the US population, but account for 44% of the new infections. Black men, in particular, are disproportionately burdened, accounting for 70% of new HIV cases among African Americans. In addition, African Americans tend to have sex with people of the same race. As the prevalence of HIV increases within this community, the risk of infection concomitantly increases with each new sexual encounter. Given this epidemiological reality, reducing sexual risk behaviors among African American HIV+ men who have sex with men (MSM), with women (MSW), and with both men and women (MSM/W) is a prevention imperative. To address this, we intend to develop and test Positively tHrIVing, an HIV behavioral intervention based on modules 2 and 3 of the Healthy Living Project (HLP; a ""best evidence"" CDC intervention), and then tailored it to fit the unique needs of HIV+ African American men (both MSM and MSW). This will include a focus on the distinctive challenges faced by all men independent of race (e.g., the influence of gender roles on sexual risk behaviors), faced by African-Americans living in the United States (e.g., discrimination, socioeconomic issues), and the intersection of these factors with the gender of sexual partners (e.g., managing power inequalities in heterosexual relationships v. facing homophobia and cultural issues). Additionally, Positively tHrIVing will adopt a pro-health point of view so that it will be perceived as supportive and nonstigmatizing. Finally, Positively tHrIVing will be computer-based to further increase acceptability among patients and physicians, reduce staff time, lower costs, increase fidelity of treatment delivery, and enhance the probability of widespread dissemination. The results of Phase I strongly support the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the program - far exceeding the three usability benchmarks established in the Phase I proposal. In Phase II we will complete development of the Positively tHrIVing program and test its effectiveness in a pretest-posttest experimental design. 240 HIV+ African American men will be randomly assigned to receive either the computer-based Positively tHrIVing program or flash-enabled STD CDC fact sheets. Before, and at two points after random assignment, participants' sexual transmission risk behavior, medication adherence, disclosure, health behaviors, and substance use will be assessed through an online survey-questionnaire.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to develop a computer-based HIV behavioral intervention for HIV+ African American men. For clinics, this will allow them to provide an empirically validated HIV prevention intervention to their clients without creating additional demands on their already overburdened staff. For HIV+ African American men, the skills contained in this program will help them reduce risk behaviors and, ultimately, prevent the spread of HIV.

"Health Promotion for Positives: A Randomized Trial with HIV Positive Black Men  PROJECT SUMMARY:      This application is in response to RFA-MD-12-001, ""NIMHD Health Disparities Research (R01)."" African  American men who are infected with HIV are living longer and are being impacted by the same chronic  diseases that affect the general population of African American men over 40.  To be sure, African American  men, in general, have disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, kidney  disease, and cancer, particularly prostate and colon cancer.  However, HIV infection is associated with an  increased risk for co-morbidity from chronic diseases.  This increased risk is heightened by HIV infection, but  also its treatment with certain agents used in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) combinations.  Many  of these chronic illnesses have behavioral components-risk is influenced by what people do and don't do,  their diet, and the amount of physical activity they get.  Although the high risk for multiple behavior-linked  chronic diseases among HIV-positive individuals has been recognized, there is a lack of evidence-based  intervention specifically tailored to their needs. Hence, the broad objective is to reduce the risk of chronic  diseases among HIV positive African American men.  The Specific Aims are to test the efficacy of a theory- based, contextually appropriate health promotion intervention in inducing positive changes in behaviors linked  to risk of chronic diseases among HIV positive African American men age 40 years or older and to identify the  theoretical variables that mediate its efficacy.  The study will utilize a randomized controlled trial.  The  participants will be 384 African American HIV positive men age 40 or older who are receiving HAART for HIV.   The men will be randomized to a theory-based contextually appropriate health promotion intervention that  involves three, 3-hour weekly intervention sessions or an attention-control group.  The health promotion  intervention will be an adaptation of an intervention based on social cognitive theory integrated with formative  research and found to be efficacious in increasing adherence to 5-a-Day diet and physical activity guidelines  and prostate cancer screening guidelines in the applicants' preliminary studies.  Data will be collected at  baseline, immediately post, 3, 6 and 12 months post intervention, which will permit assessment of the short- term and long-term effects of the intervention and whether the intervention's efficacy varies over time.  Audio  computer-assisted self-interviewing will be used to assess self-reported adherence to physical activity  guidelines, 5-a-Day fruit and vegetable guidelines, prostate screening guidelines, and colon cancer screening  guidelines and theoretical mediators of behavior change.  Objective outcomes will include health-related fitness  (6-minute walk test, 1-minute push-up test, 1-minute sit-up test, sit-and-reach test), physiological variables  (blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-hip ratio), and prostate and colon cancer  screening based on medical record review.       8.  PROJECT NARRATIVE     Highly activity antiretroviral treatment (HAART) for HIV has caused dramatic decreases in HIV-related  opportunistic infections and mortality~ hence, people are living longer with HIV.  Aging is associated with  increased risk of chronic diseases, but HIV infection and HAART also heighten these risks.  Even in the  absence of HIV, African American men are at disproportionately high risk for chronic disease morbidity and  mortality.  This research, then, responds to the urgent need for interventions to reduce the risk of non-HIV  related chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes in HIV positive African  American men age 40 and older.

"A Culture Centered Narrative Approach for Health Promotion     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latina adolescents experience high rates of birth, HIV infection, and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), both nationwide and in Holyoke.1 Latinas have the highest teen birth rate of any major ethnic/racial minority in the U.S. at 70.1/1000 births, in comparison to an overall teen birth rate of 39.1/1000.2 Among all racial/ethnic groups, Latinos rank second for all adult and adolescent HIV diagnoses.3 In 2009, U.S. Latinas ages 15-19 had rates of Chlamydia at 21.9/1000, in comparison to 11.37/1000 for their white peers.4 Behavioral interventions that seek to promote safer sex among Latino/a youth often fail to address the cultural values that can drive individual's decisions and actions. As a result, they are often ineffective.5 There is a clear imperative to identify, disseminate, and implement culturally specific narrative-based interventions.  Interventions that engage youth participants in arts- and narrative-based processes, 6-8 while also acknowledging their everyday realities and the variability in meanings of sexuality, including a positive sexuality perspective, 9, and 10 may be effective for promoting sexual health and wellbeing. By foregrounding the voices of young Latinas to articulate their own meanings of health, and considering these perspectives in the development of health promotion programs,11 culture-centered approaches can effectively promote positive sexual health outcomes.12,13 While culturally centered content has been linked to sexual health promotion among young Latinas, with culture-centric health promotion messages evaluated for their overall effectiveness,13,19,20 the narrative process itself has not been well tested for the way that it works as a mechanism of health promotion. Our multidisciplinary project team proposes to use a ""young person-driven, researcher-facilitated"" narrative methodology21 to address this research gap.  The proposed project takes a narrative approach, using digital storytelling (DST) to rigorously map the mechanisms by which participants form culturally specific meanings of sexuality, sexual health, and wellbeing. Resulting culturally specific data will be used to inform the future development of culturally centered sexual health interventions. The impact of the process will result in increased levels in self-esteem and clarity of personal sexual values, increases in sexual decision-making and communication skills, and an increase in perceived choices in one's actions among participants. The specific aims of this project are to (1) Identify cultural paradigms of sexual health among three groups of adolescent Puerto Rican Latinas; (2) Assess the effects of the process of creating digital stories on participants' sexual attitudes/values, self-determination, and use of protective behaviors; and (3) Explore the perceived value of produced digital stories for workshop participants, to inform the choice of resonant digital stories for use in a larger scale promotion effort in the next phase of research.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Latina adolescents experience high rates of birth, HIV infection, and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), both nationwide and in Holyoke, the proposed site for this exploratory project.

"Sexual Orientation and Obesity:  Test of a Gendered Biopsychosocial Model    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant: Sexual Orientation and Obesity: Test of a Gendered Biopsychosocial Model Obesity is one of the most critical public health issues affecting the U.S. today. Racial and socioeconomic disparities in the determinants, distribution, and consequences of obesity are receiving increasing attention; however, one area that is only beginning to be recognized is the striking interplay of gender and sexual orientation in obesity disparities. It is now well-established that women of minority sexual orientation are disproportionately affected by the obesity epidemic, with nearly three-quarters of adult lesbians overweight or obese, compared to half of heterosexual women. In stark contrast, among men, heterosexual males have nearly double the risk of obesity compared to gay males. Despite clear evidence from descriptive epidemiologic research that sexual orientation and gender markedly pattern obesity disparities, there is almost no prospective, analytic epidemiologic research into the causes of these disparities. It will be impossible to develop evidence-based preventive interventions unless we first answer basic questions about causal pathways, as we plan to do. Our study has high potential for public health impact not only for sexual minorities but also for heterosexuals, as we seek to uncover how processes of gender socialization may exacerbate obesity risk in both sexual minority females and heterosexual males. In response to PA-07-409 ""Health Research with Diverse Populations,"" we will rigorously test our innovative gendered biopsychosocial model that is both multilevel and multisystem to explain observed sexual orientation disparities in obesity. We will use longitudinal, repeated measures survey data and also biological data from three youth cohorts: Growing Up Today Study (GUTS) 1 & 2 and National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), all ongoing prospective cohorts that together total over 47,000 youth living throughout the United States.

"Translating the Diabetes Prevention Program to Engage Men in Disadvantaged Areas     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rising epidemic of type 2 diabetes is a major cause of disability and death. With an estimated cost of $245 billion in 2012, diabetes also represents a significant burden to the U.S. health care system. Following the successful trial of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in 2002, the translation of this lifestyle intervention to community settings has been a major public health focus, with significant support from the CDC through the National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP). Although the NDPP has been shown to be effective for enrolled participants, resulting in weight loss of 5-7%, independent of setting and population group, there are striking disparities in engagement. Participation rates for men are particularly low (often <30% of a class); participation rates for Black and Latino men are even lower (<20%). Men generally have poorer health outcomes and lower life expectancies than women. Men of color, who are more likely than their white counterparts to face significant disadvantage, experience higher rates of diabetes-related complications, such as cardiovascular disease and end-stage renal disease. Given the disproportionate burden of diabetes and its complications for disadvantaged groups, targeted diabetes prevention programming is a crucial component of public health planning. This proposal is for a translational, cluster randomized trial of the NDPP in 16 sites for the main study, tailored to recruit, engage and retain men from disadvantaged communities in type 2 diabetes prevention. The proposed tailored program, the NDPPB, will first be pilot tested with 30 men in 2 sites before being implemented in 8 NYC Parks and Recreation Department (REC) sites in disadvantaged communities in each of the 5 boroughs of NYC, with 8 standard NDPP REC sites for comparison. Working in collaboration with a stakeholder Advisory Panel of community leaders and academic experts, we will conduct focused outreach to the target population. We will implement the evidence-based NDPP curriculum, with tailoring to promote increased engagement of men. For our proposal, ""engagement"" encompasses recruitment, group participation, and retention. We propose having male-only coaches and groups members, adaptations to the dietary messaging, and increased emphasis on physical activity. For comparison, the standard mixed-gender groups will be implemented at eight separate REC sites, matched by NYC borough, using the standard NDPP curriculum. In the main study, we will enroll a total of 830 participants (age 18 and older) across the 16 REC sites. The specific aims of the proposed study are: 1) to assess the effectiveness of the NDPPB with respect to reductions in BMI (primary outcome) compared to the standard NDPP model. We hypothesize that men engaged in the NDPPB will have reductions in BMI at 16 weeks at least equivalent to those in the standard NDPP; 2) to examine the extent to which recruitment/enrollment, intervention and retention strategies tailored for men at risk for type 2 diabetes in disadvantaged communities are associated with improved engagement of the target population (secondary outcomes). We hypothesize that implementation of the NDPPB will proceed with more rapid recruitment and enrollment of men than in the standard NDPP; 3) to identify demographic, psychosocial, neighborhood, and REC site characteristics associated with differential recruitment and intervention effects; and 4) to provide estimates of incremental costs of the NDPPB in comparison to the standard community-based NDPP programs and relative to the primary outcome of change in BMI. Strengths of our proposal include: rigorous design and analytic methodologies, with randomization by site, a participatory approach and an adaptive process for development of our intervention with the NYC REC sites, along with a strong community and expert Advisory Panel. If our hypotheses are supported, this study will inform real-world implementation of the NDPP program in community settings for high-risk men and make a significant contribution to reducing the diabetes burden in these populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health relevance of this proposal is that although the National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) has been shown to be effective in preventing or delaying type 2 diabetes for enrolled participants, there are disparities in enrollment and engagement by men, especially those from disadvantaged communities. If our hypotheses are supported, this study with its recruitment strategies and adapted curriculum will inform real- world implementation of the NDPP program in accessible community settings for men and will make a significant contribution to reducing the diabetes burden in these high-risk populations.            ",Translating the Diabetes Prevention Program to Engage Men in Disadvantaged Areas,8755373,R18DK102080,"['Age ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' foot ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Planning ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Recreation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Collaborations ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' programs ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Leg ', ' Population Group ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NIDDK,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R18,2014,211958,0.046267384318112795
"A study to improve the fit of HIV prevention methods ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A policy statement by the World Health Organization notes that,  the male latex condom is the single, most efficient, available technology to reduce the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.  Unfortunately, despite decades of condom promotion efforts, condoms usage rates remain disappointingly low. Between one-third and one-half of men report poor condom fit, and these men are more likely to forego condom use. TheyFit LLC seeks to address this problem by manufacturing fitted condoms, with 95 different sizes available. Potential users can objectively determine their fitted condom size by using a paper measurement tool to determine their length and circumference measurements, thereby personalizing the condom sizing process. The proposed research will involve conducting a clinical trial to inform understanding of fitted condom safety performance (i.e. condom breakage and slippage), as well as addressing whether users perceive that fitted condoms enhance pleasure. This blinded trial will be conducted among diverse populations, allowing for assessment of condom performance for both anal and vaginal sex outcomes. This proposal will provide innovation by providing additional data to move condoms towards being regulated medical devices for anal sex. Additionally, this will be the first condom trial, to our knowledge, to explicitly assess pleasure as a primary endpoint. To maximize the public health benefits of increased condom options, we also propose to develop a mobile phone application (app) for automating the determination of fitted condom size. TheyFit will work in collaboration with faculty in Emory University's Departments of Epidemiology and Behavioral Sciences and Health Education, who have extensive expertise conducting clinical trial and related epidemiological research regarding HIV/AIDS among diverse populations. The proposed research has potential to inform efforts aimed at reducing HIV-related disparities and reducing new HIV infections, meeting two priority areas identified in the Strategic Plan of the NIH Office of AIDS Research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Condoms are the most efficient and available technology for preventing HIV transmission, but many men don't use condoms and report problems with poorly fitting condoms. The goal of this project is to allow potential users to select their best condom size, and to see if these condoms increase pleasure and performance. Having an expanded range of condom sizes made available is a promising strategy in increasing condom usage, particularly in high-risk populations.                ",A study to improve the fit of HIV prevention methods,8846451,R44HD078154,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Lasers ', ' Latex ', ' male ', ' Medical Device ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Paper ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' penis ', ' Perception ', ' pressure ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' Sales ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' falls ', ' Businesses ', ' Health Benefit ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Blinded ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Custom ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' European ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Anal Sex ', ' tool ', ' Scanning ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Width ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Performance ', ' condoms ', ' pleasure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' NIH Office of AIDS Research ', ' Resolution ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' male group ', "" men's group "", ' commercialization ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' FDA approved ', ' high standard ', ' randomized trial ', ' phase II study ', ' phase 2 study ', ' ']",NICHD,"THEYFIT, LLC",R44,2014,721744,0.008642944338489528
"Evaluating a Structural and Behavioral HIV Risk Reduction Program for Black Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the MEN Count intervention, an HIV intervention and prevention program for heterosexual Black men. The MEN Count model integrates HIV risk reduction and gender-equity counseling with housing and employment case management via multiple one-on-one sessions delivered by a peer case manager over 60-90 day period. MEN Count was developed and pilot tested using a CBPR approach via funding from an NIH R21, in Boston, MA. Similar CBPR methods accompanied by a more rigorous evaluation design (i.e., a randomized controlled trial- RCT) will be used to test MEN Count in an employment training community service agency for Black men in Philadelphia (NCCF). Study participants (N=504) will be Black men reporting heterosexual risk for HIV [unprotected sex with a woman in the past 30 days and 2+ female sex partners in the past 6 months] and either current unemployment or homeless in the past 6 months. To evaluate the effectiveness of MEN Count, a two-armed RCT will be conducted in which participants will be randomized to receive either MEN Count or an attention comparison program similar to MEN Count in structure but focused on general men's health- nutrition, exercise and primary health care utilization. We will assess program impact on reduction in number of unprotected sex episodes and incident cases of STI (Chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis) via survey and STI testing, respectively, at baseline and 6 and 12 month follow-ups. Additionally, quality assurance and process evaluation efforts will be conducted to ensure high quality program adherence and delivery, as well as to support program replication should the model prove effective.          The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the MEN Count intervention, an HIV intervention and prevention program for heterosexual Black men. The MEN Count model integrates HIV risk reduction and gender-equity counseling with housing and employment case management via three one-on-one sessions delivered by a peer case manager over 60-90 day period. A two armed randomized controlled trial will be used to evaluate the impact of MEN Count, relative to an attention comparison condition focused on diet and exercise, on reduction in unprotected sex and incident STI, as measured via computerized survey and STI tests at baseline and 6 and 12 month follow-ups.

"Relationship Disruption during Incarceration and HIV Risk in African American Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African American men released from prison face disproportionate HIV risk. Preventing HIV sexual risk behavior and drug use in this group is critical to reducing the race disparity in HIV. However, research on the factors that drive and protect against HIV risk among African American male releasees is limited. Returning to a committed partner after release may be an important protective factor against HIV risk among African American male releasees during reentry. However, incarceration destabilizes committed relationships. Though 50-80% of men enter prison in a committed relationship, we estimate that half of these relationships end by the time of release. Upon release, loss of a partner may lead men to seek multiple, new partners to meet companionship needs or may lead to distress and, in turn, self-medication with drugs or sex. No prior study has evaluated the degree to which partner loss during incarceration influences post-release HIV risk. The present mixed method study is designed to address this gap in the current field of HIV prevention science. This study seeks to examine the hypothesis that dissolution of stable intimate relationships during incarceration elevates sexual risk behavior and drug use among inmates upon their release. The specific aims are: Primary Quantitative Aims: Aim 1. Among African American men in relationships at the time of prison entry, to describe the associations between dissolution of relationships during incarceration and HIV sexual risk behavior (unprotected sex; multiple sex partnerships; buying sex for money or drugs) and drug use (crack use; binge drinking). Aim 2. To assess whether diminished mental health (low coping; increased depression; increased anxiety) due to dissolution of relationships during incarceration results in HIV sexual risk behavior and drug use. Aim 3. To evaluate whether the association between dissolution of relationships during incarceration and HIV sexual risk behavior and drug use varies by respondent and relationship characteristics. Qualitative Aim: To qualitatively explore the social context of post-release and men's perceptions of the factors and processes driving post-release sexual risk behavior and drug use. To accomplish these study aims, we propose to recruit 400 African American male inmates who are scheduled to be released from prison and who were in stable intimate heterosexual relationships at the time of prison entry. Our pilot work suggests that ~50% of relationships will have ended during the incarceration. We will follow men after their release to assess whether post-release sexual risk behavior and drug use are higher among men whose relationships ended during incarceration versus men whose relationships remained intact. The proposed study is designed to inform development of policies and interventions that minimize the destabilizing effects of criminal justice involvement on relationships and health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Since more than 800,000 African American men are incarcerated in prison at any given time, and hundreds of thousands return home to their communities each year, policies and programs that are effective in reducing HIV risk in this group would prevent substantial numbers of new infections among African American men and members of their sexual networks annually. This research will determine whether dissolution of committed relationships during incarceration is a risk factor for post-release HIV sexual risk behavior and drug use among African American male releasees and will describe the pathways through which relationship dissolution may work to influence HIV risk. Study findings may highlight the need for implementation of criminal justice policies that reduce network disruption and may inform HIV prevention interventions, including in-prison programs for inmates and their partners that foster communication and prevent relationship dissolution, and pre-release HIV prevention education for men who have lost a committed partner during incarceration.

"A systems science approach to understanding sexual risk behavior in young women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young women are at disproportionate risk of STIs and their consequences, with the highest rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea, as well as outcomes such as pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility and cervical cancer. This disease burden has a disparate on some groups of young women, such as racial/ethnic minorities and women of low socio-economic status. To date, most research and prevention programs have focused on individual- level predictors of sexual risk behavior measured at a single time point (e.g., behavioral intentions, attitudes). However, individuals' intentions to engage in risky or protective behaviors may vary across contexts and over the course of relationships. By applying a cutting-edge analytic technique to richly detailed, intensive longitudinal data, we will extend research on sexual risk behavior to address the relationship dynamics that influence these behaviors. This project will make use of data collected weekly from nearly 1,000 young women over 2.5 years, including detailed information about their relationships, sexual behavior, contraceptive use, attitudes and intentions. We will apply a novel analytic technique, the time-varying effect model, to understand women's sexual risk behavior over the course of the relationship with a sexual partner. This project has three specific aims. First, we will model patterns of young women's non-use of condoms over the course of sexual partnerships. Second, we will examine how women's intentions to use condoms differentially predict condom non-use over the course of sexual partnerships. Finally, we will delve into sources of disparities in sexual health outcomes by examining how these patterns of sexual risk behavior may differ by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic factors and urbanicity. By modeling how sexual risk behavior evolves over the course of a relationship, the proposed project will inform the creation of more effective prevention programs that are targeted to high risk populations and relationships contexts.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will allow us to understand how sexual risk behavior evolves over the course of a sexual partnership, and how this evolution may help explain disparities in outcomes for minority and low-SES young women. By applying cutting-edge techniques to richly detailed intensive longitudinal data, we will reveal patterns of sexual risk behavior that will allow us to build prevention programs tailored to address the specific needs of high-risk populations and relationship contexts. Ultimately, this will reduce STI-related morbidity and mortality.

"Social determinants of male-male sexual violence victimization and perpetration a     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A recent population-based, household survey of South African men found that nearly 1 in 10 men reported having been sexually assaulted by another man during their lifetime.1 Further examination of this figure uncovers a significant disparity in sexual violence victimization risk: men who report a history of (consensual) sex with men (MSM) are over four times more likely than non-MSM to report male-male sexual violence victimization (34.4% versus 8.1%, p=0.00) as well as perpetration (10.9% versus 2.6%, p=0.00).1  A growing body of public health research and prevention work has emerged to address high rates of sexual violence victimization among South African women, yet the sexual violence risks faced by MSM and other men remain largely unexamined, and the corresponding prevention needs of men have been overwhelmingly neglected. Further, evidence of hypothesized linkages between experiences of male-male sexual violence, sexual risk behaviors, and sexually transmitted infections remains limited in this setting.  The study presented here is an initial effort to examine potential risk and protective factors for male- male sexual violence victimization and perpetration among South African MSM. The study holds the following set of specific aims: Aim 1: To determine the 12-month and lifetime prevalence rates of male-male sexual violence victimization and perpetration among a clinic-based sample of 500 MSM; Aim 2: To evaluate a proposed conceptual model of male-male sexual violence victimization, adapted from the Theory of Gender & Power, using structural equation modeling; Aim 3: To evaluate a proposed conceptual model of male-male sexual violence perpetration, adapted from the Confluence Model of Sexual Aggression, using structural equation modeling; and Aim 4: To compare key sexual health behaviors and outcomes, including clinical measures of STI infections, practice of unprotected anal and vaginal sex, and sexual partner concurrency by history of sexual violence victimization and perpetration.  To accomplish these aims, the study will recruit a sample of 500 MSM, at least 18 years old, from two public men's sexual health clinics in Cape Town, South Africa. Participants will be asked to complete a computer-administered questionnaire and undergo syphilis and HIV rapid testing. Questionnaire topics include: community norms, relationships, and social life; gender; conflict and violence; sexual behaviors; and alcohol use. Binomial logistic regression and structural equation modeling will be used during data analysis.  The study extends the application of a gender-based social theory commonly applied in studies of female rape victimization and builds on the existing psychological model that has predominately been used to study sexual aggression. The study findings will have significant implications for clinical practice, public health theory, and the development of interventions to prevent and mitigate the impact of male-male sexual violence.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study offers a novel in-depth analysis of male-male sexual violence among South African MSM, thereby addressing a poorly understood but highly prevalent public health issue within a population that has been identified at high risk.1 This study explores how interactions between social structures and social norms may contribute to the sexual violence experiences of MSM, and explores linkages between violent experiences, sexual risk behaviors, and sexually transmitted infections. The findings from this research may be used to inform clinical and community practice to reach MSM sexual violence victims in South Africa and link them to appropriate physical health and psychosocial support services.

"Understanding the Effects of Prostate Cancer on Gay and Bisexual Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to PA-12-113, Research on the Health of LGBTI Populations, which ""encourages researchers to investigate new questions related to LGBTI health"" with ""high priority placed on research on interventions for [LGBTI] individuals."" Survivorship of prostate cancer (PCa) is one such area. Across the lifespan, 1-in-6 gay and bisexual men (GBM) and 1-in-3 male couples will be diagnosed with PCa, making PCa the most common cancer affecting GBM. Yet, almost no research has examined the effects of PCa treatment on GBM's sexual functioning. Sexual dysfunction is the major sequela of PCa treatment, which is deeply distressing in itself, and negatively impacts quality of life post-treatment, resulting in serious negative mental health outcomes. Recent studies indicate sexual outcomes of PCa treatment are significantly worse for GBM than heterosexual men. Physiological differences between anal sex and vaginal sex likely explain, at least in part, this health disparity. Tailored treatment needs to be developed, but is almost entirely unexplored. Missing is research to evaluate the effects of PCa treatment on GBM sexual functioning, research on rehabilitation outcomes, and research to guide development of new treatments tailored to GBM and sex between men.  The long-term objective of this research is to develop the first evidence-based PCa rehabilitation curriculum tailored for GBM. As a first step, in this R21 we will conduct the formative research needed to estimate the extent of poor outcomes, confirm need, and assess acceptability and feasibility. There are three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate, in-depth, the experience of PCa treatment on the sexual lives of GBM, their partners, and their relationships. We will conduct a semi-structured, chat or phone interview study of up to 48 GBM PCa patients, partners, and couples, nationally. In Aim 2, we will refine definitions and develop the measures needed to assess sexual dysfunction in GBM. In Aim 3, we will conduct an online quantitative survey of 220 GBM with PCa, which will a) quantify sexual challenges post-treatment, b) assess needs and priorities for rehabilitation, c) develop a new scale to measure sexual functioning in GBM and d) assess the acceptability and feasibility of a new rehabilitation curriculum for GBM with PCa.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study addresses a major health disparity by investigating the experience of GBM survivors of PCa and the effects of PCa treatment. It will advance science by developing the measures necessary to study the sexual sequelae of PCa treatment in GBM. This will be the largest quantitative study of GBM with PCa conducted to date, and will provide the necessary evidence base to develop an effective rehabilitation intervention for GBM with PCa.            ",Understanding the Effects of Prostate Cancer on Gay and Bisexual Men,8767750,R21CA182041,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Age ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cells ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Couples ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Interview ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Prostatectomy ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Support Groups ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' survivorship ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' Measures ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Penetration ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Survivors ', ' Base of the Prostate ', ' Base of Human Prostate ', ' Structure of base of prostate ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Erectile dysfunction ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Anal Sex ', ' instrument ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Sex Disorders ', ' Sexual Dysfunction ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' cohort ', ' Rehabilitation Outcome ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' treatment program ', ' Reporting ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer rehab ', ' cancer rehabilitation ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' sexual functioning ', ' Sex Functioning ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', "" men's health "", ' male health ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' sexual minority ', ' screening ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' LGBTI ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2014,165300,-0.027033317033198563
"INITIATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF CONCURRENT PARTNERSHIPS: A LONGITUDINAL STUDY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Concurrent sexual partnerships-or partnerships which overlap in time-have been suggested as a significant contributing factor in STI/HIV transmission and acquisition. However, most studies of concurrency have utilized cross-sectional study designs with retrospective recall of behavior. As a result, little is known regarding factors associated with the initiation of concurrent partnerships, and very few studies have assessed the quality of concurrent sexual partnership data. Different motivations for initiating concurrent sexual partnerships have been associated with different degrees of STI/HIV risk. Retrospective recall is subject to known methodological challenges including memory failure and imprecision; as concurrency is typically defined by an overlap in self- reported dates of partnership, establishing the degree of reporting error in sexual partnership dates has important implications for the classification of concurrency in both research and public health practice. We will analyze data from a racially and ethnically diverse sample of young adults aged 18-30 and their sexual partners studied in the Project on Partner Dynamics (POPD) to examine to what extent: 1) a participant's belief that his/her partner has another sexual partner (perceived partner concurrency) predicts the participant's initiation of a concurrent partnership during the following 4 months; 2) sexual partners report the same dates for their first sexual intercourse (anal, oral, or vaginal) and for their last sexual intercourse; and 3) the observed association between perceived partner concurrency and subsequent concurrency initiation is affected by potential error in recall of dates. The POPD study recruited 537 persons from Los Angeles area community sites for a one-year study of heterosexual partnering, including interviewer-administered questionnaires about sexual risk perceptions, intentions, and behaviors at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. At 8- and 12-months, participants were invited to bring a sexual partner for interview. Index and partner respondents were interviewed separately and also jointly, to obtain couple-level answers on selected survey iteMs. We will use generalized estimating equations (GEE) to estimate the association between perceived partner concurrency and subsequent initiation of concurrent behavior over the following 4-months. We will compare reported dates of first and last sexual encounters within the partnership by examining partnership-level agreement, including percent agreement, weighted kappa, and the distribution of differences in reported dates. We will use the observed distribution of differences in a sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of potential reporting error on the classification of concurrency and on the observed association between perception of partner concurrency and subsequent initiation of concurrency. This information on the quality of concurrency measurement has important implications for STI research. Knowledge about predictors of concurrency initiation may provide insights into addressing STI disparities among racial/ethnic minorities.   The fellowship applicant will analyze data from a racially and ethnically diverse sample of young adults aged 18-30 years and their sexual partners, studied in the Project on Partner Dynamics (POPD), to examine to what extent: 1) a participant's belief that his/her partner has another sexual partner (perceived partner concurrency) predicts the participant's initiation of a concurrent partnership during the following 4 months; 2) participants accurately report the beginning and ending dates sexual partnerships; and 3) the impact of likely inaccuracy in reporting of partnership dates on the observed association between perceived partner concurrency and subsequent concurrency initiation.",INITIATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF CONCURRENT PARTNERSHIPS: A LONGITUDINAL STUDY,8662285,F31HD068126,"['Affect ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Coitus ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Fellowship ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Interviewer ', ' Interview ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Literature ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Memory ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Questionnaires ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' Weight ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Measurement ', ' Respondent ', ' Knowledge ', ' Oral ', ' Equation ', ' Participant ', ' Agreement ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' age difference ', ' Reporting ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' risk perception ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' aged ', ' high risk ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' sexual encounter ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2014,31526,0.0626873988101783
"Prostate Cancer Detection Decision-Making for Low-Income African American Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excess mortality due to prostate cancer among African American men is one of the most intractable cancer disparities. In the San Francisco Bay Area, incidence in this group is 40 percent higher and mortality is more than twice that for non-Hispanic White men. Research to increase early detection in this high risk group has stalled due to controversies surrounding the efficacy of the PSA test and even though the equivocal studies that tested the PSA did not include adequate samples of African American men. Resulting national guidelines emphasize shared decision-making (SDM) prior to PSA testing, a process to elucidate a patient's values and preferences and to foster his understanding of the limitations of the test. Because disproportionately more African American men have low literacy skills, it is not clear whether SDM is feasible or commonly practiced in settings where low-income men and/or those of low educational attainment access cancer screening such as health fairs and public health clinics. We propose first to ascertain current and best possible pre-screening SDM communication practices in these settings. Second, because the PSA debate is largely due to over-treatment of low-risk disease and since approximately 95 percent of PSA test results are normal, we will explore the feasibility of shifting the focus of SDM from screenin to pre-biopsy counseling for the 5 percent of men with elevated PSAs. For this community-based participatory and mixed methods study, our specific aims are: 1. To document current practices in shared decision-making for PSA testing where uninsured, low-income and/or low-literacy African American men obtain screening, and to explore the potential for effective SDM communication in these settings.  a. conduct in-depth interviews with 20 clinicians, 20 staff, and 20 patients regarding SDM and screening to  ascertain key concepts, barriers, and facilitators, and to inform survey questions;  b. conduct observations of 200 men at community screenings to document SDM in these settings;  c. measure PSA test and SDM practices, preferences and confidence regarding SDM, barriers to SDM,  and tailoring by race/ethnicity and health literacy in a survey of 150 providers with practices of at least 10 percent  African American patients. 2. To assess the feasibility of pre-biopsy counseling (PBC) for African American men with an elevated PSA by pilot testing a theory-based PBC protocol with 40 men with a recent abnormal test.                PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study addresses one of the most intractable cancer disparities, the excess mortality due to prostate cancer experienced by African American men. Efforts to increase early detection in this population have stalled due to the controversies surround efficacy of the PSA test and concerns regarding over-treatment of early stage disease. Experts recommend that all men engage in ""informed decision-making"" (consideration of benefits, harms, risks and how these factors fit with individual values), usually in conversation with their doctor. Our study will assess the viability of this process in settings where low-income men obtain care, and the feasibility of decision-making prior to biopsy among men whose PSA test results are abnormal.            ",Prostate Cancer Detection Decision-Making for Low-Income African American Men,8613478,R21CA171953,"['Anthropology ', ' Biopsy ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Counseling ', ' Decision Making ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Fairs ', ' Incidence ', ' Influentials ', ' Interview ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urology ', ' Excess Mortality ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Decision Aid ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Uninsured ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Radiation Oncology ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Staging ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Test Result ', ' preference ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Provider ', ' Commit ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Health Communication ', ' Cancer Detection ', ' Communication Research ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Process ', ' health literacy ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' safety net ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' community based participatory research ', ' PSA test ', ' PSA screening ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2014,199478,-0.07886069467270346
"Social ecological determinants of young adult risk behavior     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Almost half of the 20 million reported sexually transmitted infections (STIs) each year occur in people aged 15 to 24. STIs increase risk for HIV infection and can lead to serious health complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, epididymitis, and urethritis. Sexual risk behaviors, such as not using condoms and having multiple partners, place young people at risk for STIs, especially females and African Americans, who have higher rates of infection. Decades of research from longitudinal observational and experimental studies have identified numerous factors predictive of sexual risk behaviors, yet meta-analyses of interventions targeting these behaviors show modest effects. Before more potent interventions can be built, a comprehensive model of STI risk is needed, assessing factors at multiple levels of influence (i.e., individual, social, and environmental) and determining for whom each factor is most salient. Modern causal inference approaches provide a unique opportunity to quickly leverage existing resources to address these pressing research questions. For example, propensity score methods efficiently reduce the bias of many third variables that represent alternative causal explanations; thus, it becomes possible to assess factors that otherwise cannot be randomized for ethical or practical reasons. The proposed study will apply propensity score methods to data from the first three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to estimate the causal effects of individual (e.g., perceived benefits of sex), social (e.g., supportive friendships, parental attitues about sex, parent connectedness, school connectedness), and environmental (e.g., access to sexual education curriculum, access or referral to family planning services) factors on sexual risk behaviors in young adulthood. In addition, we will determine whether the pathways leading to STI health disparities vary by gender and race/ethnicity groups and explore how social ecological factors interact with one another. For example, we will examine whether high parental connectedness (social level) mitigates the effect of perceived benefits of sex (individual level) o sexual risk behaviors in young adulthood, and whether having access to sexual education curriculum (environmental level) offsets the effect of not having supportive friendships (social level) on sexual risk behaviors. Behavioral theories are virtually silent about interactions between factors and across levels, yet understanding their presence (or absence) could guide researchers in the construction of more effective and tailored interventions. The results of this study will inform the development of effective STI preventive interventions, thereby reducing the public health burden of STIs among young people.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Despite decades of research to identify and intervene on the social ecological factors for sexual risk behaviors, STI incidence rates remain stubbornly persistent, particularly among young people aged 15 to 24. By leveraging existing resources, we will use innovative causal inference methods to strengthen the understanding of which factors are most strongly associated with sexual risk behaviors that place young people at risk for STIs, how these factors mitigate or exacerbate one other, and for whom the factors are most salient. These findings will enable researchers to develop more potent STI preventive interventions, thereby reducing the public health burden of STIs among young people.            ",Social ecological determinants of young adult risk behavior,8679039,R03HD079711,"['Accounting ', ' Behavior ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Family Planning ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epididymitis ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' unable to bear children ', ' infertile ', ' Difficulty conceiving ', ' Cannot achieve a pregnancy ', ' Infertility ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Multiple Partners ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Students ', ' Urethritis ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Friendships ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' sexually active ', ' Pelvic Inflammatory Disease ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Techniques ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' age group ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' hormonal contraception ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' fourteen year old ', ' age 14 years ', ' 14 year old ', ' public health relevance ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' ']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2014,63000,0.05195366180729515

"Racial differences in low-income Men's fertility intentions and behavior  Project Summary/ Abstract Unintended pregnancy is a substantial problem in the United States, with adverse consequences for women, their children, and society. Unintended pregnancy is especially prevalent among low-income and minority populations, and such disparities contribute to the cycle of disadvantage experienced by vulnerable populations. Our ongoing work examining how socio-cultural factors contribute to poor contraceptive behaviors among low-income, African-American and white women has revealed that pregnancy-promoting and coercive behavior by their male partners may play a significant role in the high unintended pregnancy rates observed in these populations. National and international family planning advocates and guidelines are calling for engaging men more actively in contraceptive decision making, yet the dearth of literature on men's attitudes towards contraceptive use and pregnancy and how attitudes may vary by race curtails the development of culturally-relevant interventions. Therefore, gaining insight into men's fertility-related attitudes and behaviors is a critical next step. We propose to conduct a qualitative study utilizing in-depth interviews with 60 low-income, adult AA and white men in Pittsburgh to gain insight about men's fertility intentions and behavior in a population that is at high risk of unintended pregnancy. A particular focus of this study will be to examine attitudes and social norms regarding reproductive coercion as one potential end of the spectrum of male fertility behavior. We will also pay close attention to themes that appear to be unique to each of the two racial groups. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) describe the spectrum of fertility intentions and behaviors among low-income men, 2) explore the relationship between men's fertility intentions and behaviors; and 3) understand how cultural and structural factors shape men's fertility intentions and behaviors. As male partners appear to play a significant role in pregnancy decisions and outcomes, there is a need to better understand their contextualized perspectives on contraception, pregnancy, and parenthood. This study will complement our ongoing qualitative work with women to provide a more complete picture of the factors that influence family planning and allow us to pinpoint specific contextual factors that contribute to poor contraceptive behaviors and risk for unintended pregnancy among low-income, AA and white populations in Pittsburgh, PA. The ultimate goal of this research is to empower women and men, regardless of race or socioeconomic status, to make effective reproductive decisions and reduce unintended and/or unilaterally- desired pregnancies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unintended pregnancy is an enormous problem in the United States, and racial/ethnic minorities are at particularly high risk. Given that male partners influence reproductive decisions and outcomes, understanding men's fertility-related attitudes and behaviors and how these vary by race may provide more insights to understand the observed racial disparity in unintended pregnancy rates. This research will lay the groundwork for culturally-relevant programs that seek to bridge men's and women's fertility goals and maximize the potential for increasing the proportion of pregnancies that are congruently and consciously desired.            ",Racial differences in low-income Men's fertility intentions and behavior,8638089,R21HD076327,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Coercion ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Family Planning ', ' Contraceptive Behavior ', ' Contraception Behavior ', ' Contraceptives ', ' Contraceptive Agents ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' Couples ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' Fertility ', ' Goals ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Control Locus ', ' Low Income Population ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Play ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy Rate ', ' pressure ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Sexuality ', ' Societies ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Guidelines ', ' insight ', ' social norm ', ' Shapes ', ' fatherhood ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Inhibition of Fertilization ', ' Fertility Control ', ' Contraception ', ' Contraceptive methods ', ' reproductive ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Low income ', ' Advocate ', ' International ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' comparative ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2014,229920,0.03953298829887676
"Reducing Risk of HIV/STD Infection Among African American Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The high rates of sexually transmitted disease (STD), including HIV, among African American (AA) men who reside in urban areas are a major public health problem. In addition, the most common route of HIV transmission among AA women is heterosexual exposure. Yet, little research has focused on gender-specific strategies to dissuade heterosexually active AA men from engaging in high HIV/STD transmission risk behaviors. Accordingly, the broad, long-term objective of this research is to develop such strategies. The Specific Aims include testing the efficacy of a theory-based, gender-specific contextually appropriate HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention in increasing consistent condom use, identifying theoretical mediators that account for the intervention's effects, and testing a strategy to increase the longevity of the intervention's effects. This research will utilize a randomized controlled trial design with 360 inner-city AA men 18 to 45 years who report recent unprotected vaginal or anal intercourse with a woman. Men will be randomly allocated to one of two small-group interventions specially designed for AA men: (a) a HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention or (b) a health promotion control intervention on healthful diet and physical activity. To evaluate a strategy to increase the longevity of intervention effects, the men also will be randomized to receive or not receive individually tailored mailings to reinforce the intervention's message. The approach draws on social cognitive theory, the theory of planned behavior, and the applicant's Preliminary Studies with AA men. The primary outcome is self-reported consistent condom use during vaginal and heterosexual anal intercourse in the previous 3 months collected at baseline and 6 and 12 months post-intervention via audio-computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI). Secondary outcomes include other sexual behaviors and theoretical variables hypothesized to mediate intervention efficacy. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) and random effects models will be employed to address the Specific Aims.               RELEVANCE: This research may provide an urgently needed intervention to reduce the risk of STDs, including HIV, in African American men, one of the highest risk populations in the US. Moreover, African American women have 20 times the rate of HIV seen in White women, with over 75% of the cases are tied to sexual relations with men. However, few trials have tested gender-specific HIV/STD risk-reduction interventions for heterosexually active men.",Reducing Risk of HIV/STD Infection Among African American Men,8587440,R01MD004075,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Mails ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Planning Theory ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' Woman ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Physical activity ', ' infectious disease transmission ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' disease transmission ', ' Native Americans ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Life ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Route ', ' behavior change ', ' Equation ', ' inner city ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' trial design ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' cost ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' high risk ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' consistent condom use ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2014,396000,0.00770674393320103
"Social-Structural Stressors, Resilience and Sexual Risk Behaviors Among Black Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to exact a severe toll on Black men in the U.S. Although they represent just 14% of the male population, Black men accounted for 47% of HIV cases among men in 2009. The association between disproportionately high rates of HIV/AIDS in Black communities and social-structural factors such as poverty, neighborhood instability, and incarceration are well documented. Despite increasing advocacy for more social-structural approaches to HIV prevention however, considerable gaps in knowledge exist about how social structural stressors at the population-level and sociodemographic stressors at the individual-level (e.g., individual socioeconomic status, perceptions of racial discrimination) are associated with Black men's sexual HIV risk behaviors. There is also a dearth of knowledge about how resilience at both the neighborhood and individual-level may protect against Black men's sexual HIV risk behaviors. We propose a 5-year cross-sectional multiphase mixed methods study in Philadelphia, PA, in which we use geospatial analysis, qualitative methods, and multilevel quantitative modeling to refine and test a conceptual model of neighborhood-level social-structural stressors, individual-level sociodemographic stressors, psychological risk factors, neighborhood-level and individual-level resilience, and Black men's sexual HIV risk and protective behaviors. The study has 3 phases. Phase I includes focus groups to explore neighborhood-level social- structural stressors and resilience and to inform spatial data analyses of social-structural stressors (e.g., neighborhood poverty, neighborhood instability, crime) that may be associated with Black men's sexual HIV risk behaviors. Phase II involves the multilevel modeling of social-structural and sociodemographic stressors (e.g., individual SES), psychological risk factors, resilience, and sexual HIV risk and protective behaviors with a probability sample of 700 Black men between the ages of 18 and 44, of all sexual orientations, recruited from 100 Census block-groups. Phase III involves the integration of the study's results with spatial data visualization and culturally grounded explanations based on interviews with 30 Black men, followed by focus groups to confirm the study's interpretations. The expected outcome of this innovative study is that it will guide the development of structural interventions to reduce HIV incidence in Black men and their sexual partners regardless of the partners' gender. The overall positive impact of the research is that it will advance empirical knowledge about the multilevel social-structural stressors and resilience of Black men's lives with implications for reducing HIV incidence and other health disparities prevalent among Black men. The proposed study is highly responsive to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy's stated goals of reducing HIV incidence in Black men and women.          The disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS among Black men makes the development of innovative HIV prevention research that can inform structural interventions for this population, a top public health priority. The proposed research is highly relevant to public health HIV prevention initiatives in general, and in particular to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy's stated goals of reducing HIV incidence in Black men and women.

"HIV Education for African American Men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One in 16 Black men will be diagnosed with HIV in his lifetime as compared to 1 in 102 White men. Approximately 20% of all new HIV cases among African American men are due to heterosexual transmission. Despite this, Black men who have sex with women (MSW) have received very little empirical attention. Traditional gender roles and power inequalities tend to give men greater control over sexual decision-making in African American relationships. However, Black men do not routinely use condoms, one of the most effective HIV prevention methods beyond abstinence, during sex with women. These findings suggest that the failure to target heterosexually active African American men in HIV prevention efforts is a missed opportunity.  A key barrier to male condom use is reduced sexual pleasure. The female condom (FC) is an alternative HIV protection method that may overcome this barrier. Research shows that Black women respond well to FC education, but gender norms may impede their efforts to introduce FCs to male partners. One way to overcome this roadblock is to provide FC training directly to men. Indeed, studies have shown that men can learn FC skills, will help female partners use FC, and report fewer unprotected sex partners after receiving FC and male condom training. In addition, men endorse several benefits to FC use, including STI protection and natural feel. Importantly, some men prefer FCs because they provide greater sexual sensation than male condoms.  To harness the potential of FC training for Black MSW, we intend to develop e-focus, a computer-based HIV behavioral intervention for heterosexually active African American men that includes training in both male and female condom use. e-focus will web-enable the core components of Focus on the Future (FOF), the only best-evidence HIV behavioral intervention for high-risk Black MSW. FOF is a one-hour intervention that addresses the correct and consistent use of male condoms and lubricant, condom negotiation, and the importance of men protecting their future. The main message of FOF is that there are many types of condoms and lubricants and men should experiment to find the choice that make sex feel best. By providing FC as an additional, and sometimes preferred, choice, e-focus aims to lessen the influence of decreased sexual pleasure and other condom barriers on HIV prevention. Another obstacle to Black MSW's HIV risk reduction behavior is belief in a traditional masculine ideology, which emphasizes male sexual prowess, female subordination, and heterosexuality. Black men who espouse these beliefs are more likely to engage in sexual risk behavior. To combat this, e-focus will include a discussion of masculine identity and will provide methods to reframe potentially dangerous masculine beliefs into healthier sexual and relationship behaviors.  Phase I prototype development will be informed by formative research with target end-users and African American women, as well as input from our expert consultants. The completed prototype will undergo usability testing and a prototype review with African American MSW seeking services at an HIV/STI service provider.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to develop a computer-based HIV prevention program for African American men who have sex with women (MSW) that includes education and training about female and male condoms. This project will allow clinics to provide an empirically validated HIV prevention intervention to their clients without creating additional demands on their already overburdened staff. The skills contained in this program will help African American MSW reduce unprotected sex acts, and ultimately prevent the spread of HIV, by adding an additional barrier method - the female condom - to their arsenal of protection strategies.            ",HIV Education for African American Men,8992947,R43HD081992,"['Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Contraceptive Barrier Methods ', ' Barrier Methods ', ' Barrier Contraception ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Client ', ' Computers ', ' Male Condoms ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterosexuality ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Learning ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Sensation ', ' Esthesia ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Female Condoms ', ' Masculine ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Lifestyle Risk Reduction ', ' Risk Reduction Behavior ', ' Lubricants ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' Responsible sexual behavior ', ' Responsible Sex ', ' Protected Sex ', ' Safe Sex ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' pleasure ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Interruption ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' sexual relationship ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' Abstinence ', ' web-enabled ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' FDA approved ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' ']",NICHD,"ISA ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2015,163136,0.09075485555922802
"A study to improve the fit of HIV prevention methods ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A policy statement by the World Health Organization notes that,  the male latex condom is the single, most efficient, available technology to reduce the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.  Unfortunately, despite decades of condom promotion efforts, condoms usage rates remain disappointingly low. Between one-third and one-half of men report poor condom fit, and these men are more likely to forego condom use. TheyFit LLC seeks to address this problem by manufacturing fitted condoms, with 95 different sizes available. Potential users can objectively determine their fitted condom size by using a paper measurement tool to determine their length and circumference measurements, thereby personalizing the condom sizing process. The proposed research will involve conducting a clinical trial to inform understanding of fitted condom safety performance (i.e. condom breakage and slippage), as well as addressing whether users perceive that fitted condoms enhance pleasure. This blinded trial will be conducted among diverse populations, allowing for assessment of condom performance for both anal and vaginal sex outcomes. This proposal will provide innovation by providing additional data to move condoms towards being regulated medical devices for anal sex. Additionally, this will be the first condom trial, to our knowledge, to explicitly assess pleasure as a primary endpoint. To maximize the public health benefits of increased condom options, we also propose to develop a mobile phone application (app) for automating the determination of fitted condom size. TheyFit will work in collaboration with faculty in Emory University's Departments of Epidemiology and Behavioral Sciences and Health Education, who have extensive expertise conducting clinical trial and related epidemiological research regarding HIV/AIDS among diverse populations. The proposed research has potential to inform efforts aimed at reducing HIV-related disparities and reducing new HIV infections, meeting two priority areas identified in the Strategic Plan of the NIH Office of AIDS Research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Condoms are the most efficient and available technology for preventing HIV transmission, but many men don't use condoms and report problems with poorly fitting condoms. The goal of this project is to allow potential users to select their best condom size, and to see if these condoms increase pleasure and performance. Having an expanded range of condom sizes made available is a promising strategy in increasing condom usage, particularly in high-risk populations.                ",A study to improve the fit of HIV prevention methods,8935637,R44HD078154,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Lasers ', ' Latex ', ' male ', ' Medical Device ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Paper ', ' Patents ', ' Legal patent ', ' penis ', ' Perception ', ' pressure ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Safety ', ' Sales ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' computer program/software ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' falls ', ' Businesses ', ' Health Benefit ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Blinded ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Custom ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' European ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Collaborations ', ' Anal Sex ', ' tool ', ' Scanning ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Width ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Performance ', ' condoms ', ' pleasure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' NIH Office of AIDS Research ', ' Resolution ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Conduct Clinical Trials ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' male group ', "" men's group "", ' commercialization ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' FDA approved ', ' high standard ', ' randomized trial ', ' phase II study ', ' phase 2 study ', ' ']",NICHD,"THEYFIT, LLC",R44,2015,671516,0.008642944338489528
"Gender Disparities in High-Risk PITC: The Role of Policy on Provider Practices DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed fellowship will prepare the applicant for a research career focused on HIV policies and their implementation in practice. A comprehensive training plan accompanies the proposed study and has the following objectives: (1) develop knowledge of both HIV policies and the implementation of HIV testing protocols in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA); (2) increase methodological capacity in surveys, in-depth interviews, and policy discourse analysis; and (3) publish and present research findings. The specific focus of the proposed study is to examine men's underutilization of HIV testing, and thus life-prolonging treatment. Men constitute the majority of AIDS-related morbidity and mortality in SSA even though they are less likely than women to be infected. A primary contributor to men's high rate of AIDS-related mortality is their failure to access HIV testing: in Malawi, where the study will be conducted, men comprise only 33% those tested for HIV. A common explanation is that men are more reluctant than women to learn their HIV status due to concerns that a positive status would compromise their masculinity. A plausible additional explanation is structural rather than individual: as a result of feminized policies that emphasize women's excess vulnerability to HIV, healthcare providers offer fewer HIV testing services to men than women. In Malawi, virtually all women seeking antenatal care are tested for HIV, but men must specifically request testing. Yet even in venues where all clients should be offered HIV testing, as is the case for Malawians with TB or sexually transmitted infections (STIs), men are less likely to be tested. A possible explanation could be that feminized HIV policies affect how providers interact with male versus female clients. Although studies in high-income countries show that feminized sexual health policies can lead providers to offer fewer health services to men than women, there are no equivalent studies in the high HIV-prevalence countries of SSA. The proposed study in Malawi will be the first to examine if HIV policy influences providers' perceptions of gender and HIV, and whether this affects providers' implementation of HIV testing protocols for TB and STI clients. The study has three aims: (1) To use policy discourse analysis to examine how men and women are portrayed in HIV policy, using as texts both national policies and provider-training materials; (2) To collect and analyze data from in-depth interviews with healthcare providers to assess whether there are differences in their perceptions of male and female clients; (3) To collect and analyze data from exit surveys with TB and STI clients to test whether providers offer HIV testing differently to male versus female clients. Findings from the three aims will be examined together through mixed methods analysis in order to explore the relationship between HIV policy, provider perceptions, and provider implementation of HIV testing protocols. Findings will have implications for HIV policies and can inform interventions designed to increase men's use of HIV services. The project aligns with the mission and objectives of NIMH by addressing the causes of disparities in HIV service utilization among high-risk groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project has the potential to improve public health by addressing a likely structural barrier to men's use of HIV testing, and thus their access to life-prolonging treatment. By examining the unintended consequences of HIV policy on the implementation HIV testing protocols, the project will inform policy recommendations for increasing men's use of testing, which has implications for both HIV prevention and AIDS treatment.

The MEN Count model integrates HIV risk reduction and gender-equity counseling with housing and employment case management via multiple one-on-one sessions delivered by a peer case manager over 60-90 day period. MEN Count was developed and pilot tested using a CBPR approach via funding from an NIH R21, in Boston, MA. Similar CBPR methods accompanied by a more rigorous evaluation design (i.e., a randomized controlled trial- RCT) will be used to test MEN Count in an employment training community service agency for Black men in Philadelphia (NCCF). Study participants (N=504) will be Black men reporting heterosexual risk for HIV [unprotected sex with a woman in the past 30 days and 2+ female sex partners in the past 6 months] and either current unemployment or homeless in the past 6 months. To evaluate the effectiveness of MEN Count, a two-armed RCT will be conducted in which participants will be randomized to receive either MEN Count or an attention comparison program similar to MEN Count in structure but focused on general men's health- nutrition, exercise and primary health care utilization. We will assess program impact on reduction in number of unprotected sex episodes and incident cases of STI (Chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis) via survey and STI testing, respectively, at baseline and 6 and 12 month follow-ups. Additionally, quality assurance and process evaluation efforts will be conducted to ensure high quality program adherence and delivery, as well as to support program replication should the model prove effective. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the MEN Count intervention, an HIV intervention and prevention program for heterosexual Black men. The MEN Count model integrates HIV risk reduction and gender-equity counseling with housing and employment case management via three one-on-one sessions delivered by a peer case manager over 60-90 day period. A two armed randomized controlled trial will be used to evaluate the impact of MEN Count, relative to an attention comparison condition focused on diet and exercise, on reduction in unprotected sex and incident STI, as measured via computerized survey and STI tests at baseline and 6 and 12 month follow-ups.",Evaluating a Structural and Behavioral HIV Risk Reduction Program for Black

"Community Mobilization to Improve the HIV/AIDS Continuum of Care Among Black Men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV rates are at catastrophic levels among young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). A study in 21 US cities found that 21% of YBMSM aged 18-29 were HIV+, compared to 9% of Latino and 7% of white young MSM (YMSM), and these disparities are worsening. YBMSM are more likely to be HIV-infected, less likely to be aware of their HIV-infection, and less likely to disclose that they are HIV-infected, relative to men of other ethnic/racial groups. HIV+ YBMSM are also less likely than white MSM to be in treatment for HIV and to have undetectable viral loads (VLs). When HIV+ individuals achieve an undetectable VL, their own health improves, and they are also less infectious to others. Getting to that point, however, requires that HIV+ individuals: (1) know their HIV status; (2) link to HIV care; (3) stay in care over time; (4) begin appropriate treatment; and (5) adhere to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We refer to these steps as engagement in the HIV Care Continuum (CC). While these approaches have great potential to reduce HIV incidence, it is estimated that only 25% of HIV+ people in the US have engaged in the CC to the point of having undetectable VLs. Research suggests that HIV+ YBMSM engage in the CC far less than others. A community-level intervention (CLI) to build and mobilize communities of YBMSM to support HIV+ men to engage in the CC, decrease psychosocial barriers and increase psychosocial facilitators to engage in the CC within those communities may be an efficacious approach to prevent HIV transmission and improve health outcomes for YBMSM. This proposal will test the efficacy of such a CLI model, called United Black Element+ (UBE+). UBE+ will be an adaptation of a current CLI, called UBE. UBE has already engaged hundreds of YBMSM in Dallas TX, and it diffuses support for HIV prevention and creates positive social norms around reducing rates of unprotected sex and increasing regular HIV testing by building an empowered, mobilized YBMSM community. UBE+ will be an adaptation and extension of UBE designed to increase YBMSM's engagement in the CC. The aims of this project are: (1) To adapt and expand UBE into UBE+, a multilevel intervention that includes a new focus on increasing engagement in the CC among HIV+YBMSM, including targeting psychosocial barriers and facilitators to engaging in the CC that are experienced in this community (e.g., HIV stigma and social support); (2) To implement UBE+ in Dallas for 3 years in collaboration with a local AIDS Service Organization currently implementing UBE, the Dallas County Health Department, and the Texas Department of State Health Services' (TDSHS) HIV-STD Program; and (3) To evaluate the efficacy of UBE+ in increasing engagement in the CC in Dallas (utilizing Houston as a control community) using 2 independent methods: (a) a longitudinal cohort of HIV+ YBMSM providing data on engagement in care, and experiences of psychosocial and logistic barriers and facilitators to engagement in care; and (b) public health data that the TDSHS independently collects on HIV+ YBMSM's engagement in the CC. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) are contracting HIV at alarmingly high rates that far exceed other ethnic/racial groups. These disparities are not due to increased risk behavior among YBMSM, but seem to result because YBMSM who are sexually active are more likely to encounter infectious partners. YBMSM are more likely to be HIV+, and less likely to be on treatment for HIV, and to have undetectable HIV viral loads (VLs). When HIV+ men achieve an undetectable VL, their own health improves, and they are also less infectious to others. Getting to that point requires that HIV+ individuals go through a number of steps of engaging in the continuum of care (CC), such as obtaining health care for HIV, and taking medications as prescribed. The goal of this project is to develop, implement, and test a community-level intervention to build and mobilize communities of YBMSM (ages 18-29) to support HIV+ men about engaging in the CC.

"Developing a Text Message Enhanced Physical Activity Intervention for Latino Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mexican American (MA) men report particularly low rates of physical activity (PA) and are disproportionately burdened by conditions related to sedentary lifestyle (e.g., diabetes, obesity). Due to cultural, SES, educational, and language differences, MA men may have limited access to public health interventions promoting PA. To address these rising health disparities, effective interventions that leverage state-of-the-art technology, theory, and methods are needed for MA men. Our research team has 25 years of experience developing and implementing individually tailored PA interventions. We culturally and linguistically tailored our print intervention for Latina women and then demonstrated its efficacy in two RCTs. This research experience leaves us well poised to address the PA-related health disparities in MA men. Due to the dearth of studies in this area, we conducted qualitative interviews with Spanish speaking MA men (N=10). Their feedback informed the modifications of our PA intervention as well as the creation of new materials, which were then tested in a demonstration trial with MA men (N=10). After 12 weeks, participants reported significant increases in weekly PA (Mean increase=124 minutes, sd=154.86, p =.03) with 100% retention. However, only 40% met the PA guidelines of 150 minutes/week and 30% did not adopt any activity, suggesting a more intensive intervention may be necessary. Follow-up interviews revealed that the men liked the print materials but also wanted greater accountability, more contact with staff and each other, shorter and more frequent tips, and more updates on activity opportunities. The men recommended adding a text message component to address these issues. Thus, the aim of this study is to build upon our tailored print intervention by developing new text-delivered intervention materials to complement our print-based intervention, which will now include printed tailored environmental reports. In Phase 1 we will conduct 6 focus groups with MA men to determine content, frequency, and types of text messages desired, and to identify cultural themes to incorporate into existing and new materials. Themes from the focus groups and sample text messages will be presented to a confirmatory panel. Phase 2 will be a 6-month pilot RCT with MA men (N=60) to test the text- enhanced, Spanish language, individually tailored PA intervention vs. publicly available, Spanish language health education materials, including information on PA, diet, and stress management. This will be followed by post-intervention qualitative interviews to solicit suggestions for improvements to help further refine the program. The proposed pilot will support a future R01 to establish the efficacy of this multi-media, multi-level PA intervention for MA men.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mexican American men report high rates of inactivity and related health conditions. The proposed study seeks to promote physical activity among this at-risk, understudied population by developing interactive and tailored text-messages to enhance a print-based physical activity intervention for Spanish- speaking MA men. The proposed high reach, low cost strategy for increasing physical activity has great potential for adoption on a larger scale and thereby positively impacting public health and eliminating health disparities.            ",Developing a Text Message Enhanced Physical Activity Intervention for Latino Men,8823462,R21NR014911,"['Adoption ', ' Communication ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Motivation ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Printing ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Suggestion ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Accountability ', ' Latino ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' sedentary ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Physical activity ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' programs ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Test Result ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' innovative technologies ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Update ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' ']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2015,232500,0.04414956467930744
"Factors influencing vasectomy use     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed four-year K01 Population Research Scientist Development Award supports the development of Dr. Kari White as an independent social scientist and public health researcher conducting studies of the impact of health service delivery models and policies on access to and use of highly effective contraception, with the aim of reducing disparities in unintended pregnancy. This is relevant to the NICHD mission and stated interest in research relevant to ensuring that women and men have access to safe, effective and acceptable contraceptive methods. Dr. White brings her solid training in the demography of fertility and use of qualitative and quantitative research methods to the study of contraceptive use. Her career development plan has three main goals: 1) develop expertise in methods to evaluate health services and policy from the individual perspective; 2) gain in-depth knowledge of contraceptive methods and exposure to how contraceptive services are provided; and 3) acquire advanced statistical skills and proficiency working with new data sources to analyze policies and health outcomes. These goals will be met through formal coursework, mentoring from sponsors, directed study with expert advisors, clinical observation, and conferences. She will integrate her current knowledge and skill set with those gained through the career development activities by conducting a study of the individual-, provider- and health systems-level factors contributing to the underutilization of vasectomy among low-income men in the United States. Greater use of vasectomy has the potential to reduce income-based disparities in unintended pregnancy, but there has been limited study of why this method is so little used among low-income men. To comprehensively examine the factors shaping both the demand (individual-level) and supply (provider- and health systems-level) of vasectomy, the research project aims to: 1) assess knowledge, attitudes and interest in vasectomy among low-income men who do not want more children; 2) identify barriers to providing vasectomy services to low-income men among providers at publicly funded family planning organizations and health centers; and 3) evaluate whether expanded Medicaid family planning coverage for low-income men increases vasectomy use and identify the characteristics of men getting vasectomies through the program. In sum, this career development award will provide Dr. White the structured mentoring, advanced multi-disciplinary training, and experience conducting original research that will facilitate her transition to an independent investigator leading studies on contraception. These studies will allow her to make significant contributions to understanding one of the key determinants of unintended pregnancy and that can be used to inform clinical practice and health policy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To reduce the persistently high rates of unintended pregnancy in the United States, efforts are needed to increase access to and use of highly effective contraceptive methods. Vasectomy is a safe, highly effective and cost effective method for men and couples who do not want more children, but it is rarely used among low- income groups, who have disproportionately high rates of unintended pregnancy. The proposed study will conduct an in-depth assessment of the existing obstacles to vasectomy among low-income men; these findings will identify potential approaches to improve access to and use of this method that can be used to inform clinical practice and health policy.            ",Factors influencing vasectomy use,8821169,K01HD079563,"['Age ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Client ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Family Planning ', ' Contraceptives ', ' Contraceptive Agents ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' Counseling ', ' Couples ', ' Data Sources ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Demography ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Female Sterilization ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' Fertility ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Perception ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vasectomy ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' State Interests ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' Inhibition of Fertilization ', ' Fertility Control ', ' Contraception ', ' Contraceptive methods ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' health organization ', ' Provider ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Population Research ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Sum ', ' Cognitive ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' childbearing ', ' bearing children ', ' bear children ', ' child bearing ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' 20 year old ', ' federal poverty level ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K01,2015,130375,0.050036325076214104
"Young Men of Color Who Have Sex with Men Cohort Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  U01 - Cohort Study with Young Men of Color who have Sex with Men In this fourth decade of the HIV epidemic, we continue to see 50,000 new infections annually in the U.S., particularly among Black/African American and Latino young men who have sex with men (YMSM of color), who now account for 60% of new infections among Black/African American MSM and 45% of new infections among Latino MSM. Black/African American YMSM remain five times more likely to be HIV seropositive, seven times more likely to have an undiagnosed HIV infection, and 45% more likely to be diagnosed with an STI than other YMSM. YMSM of color are also the least likely to seek and remain in HIV/AIDS care, and when they do seek care, they typically already have advanced HIV disease. Among youth who initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART), 54% will achieve viral suppression; unfortunately 57% will not be retained in care and less than 6% will remain virally suppressed. Changing the course of this epidemic is going to require a dramatically different approach to prevention. We are therefore proposing to conduct longitudinal research with a large and diverse cohort of 450 YMSM of color in order to prevent new HIV infections, reduce transmission, and reduce HIV/AIDS-related disparities by focusing on successful engagement in care. Building on the HIV Continuum of Care and Prevention paradigm (i.e., seek, test, treat, and retain in care) and the Syndemic Theory of Risk, we will use a mixed-methods study design to collect and analytically triangulate quantitative, qualitative, and biological measures at baseline and every six months. Participants will be recruited from public venues, HIV test sites, and HIV/AIDS clinics using randomized probability and purposeful sampling designs. All participants will be tracked to ensure a retention rate of 90% or better, which is a feasible target given our retention rates of 94% in the Healthy Young Men's (HYM) Study. The specific aims are to 1) better understand and operationally define what linkage, engagement, retention to care (both primary health and HIV/AIDS treatment) and adherence means to HIV- and HIV+ YMSM of color; 2) characterize and monitor over time YMSM of color's use of alcohol and illicit drugs; utilization of HIV testing and prevention services; incidence of HIV and STIs; insurance status and access to health care services, including primary care and HIV/AIDS treatment services; engagement in and utilization of health care and HIV/AIDS treatment services; retention in HIV/AIDS care and adherence to ART; and utilization of biomedical interventions, such as PrEP and PEP; and 3) identify barriers/facilitator of engagement along the HIV Continuum of Care and Prevention. The proposed research builds on close to two decades of NIH-funded research by our team focused on this and other high-risk youth populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is an urgent need to address increasing rates of HIV/AIDS among high-risk Black, Latino and multiracial young men who have sex with men in Los Angeles. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to develop new interventions designed to reduce HIV/STI risk and transmission, reduce HIV/AIDS disease progression, and improve the health and quality of life of HIV+ young men. This research will also inform the development of new HIV service delivery models given that the U.S. is now reevaluating all models of care under the auspices of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and

"Understanding the Effects of Prostate Cancer on Gay and Bisexual Men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to PA-12-113, Research on the Health of LGBTI Populations, which ""encourages researchers to investigate new questions related to LGBTI health"" with ""high priority placed on research on interventions for [LGBTI] individuals."" Survivorship of prostate cancer (PCa) is one such area. Across the lifespan, 1-in-6 gay and bisexual men (GBM) and 1-in-3 male couples will be diagnosed with PCa, making PCa the most common cancer affecting GBM. Yet, almost no research has examined the effects of PCa treatment on GBM's sexual functioning. Sexual dysfunction is the major sequela of PCa treatment, which is deeply distressing in itself, and negatively impacts quality of life post-treatment, resulting in serious negative mental health outcomes. Recent studies indicate sexual outcomes of PCa treatment are significantly worse for GBM than heterosexual men. Physiological differences between anal sex and vaginal sex likely explain, at least in part, this health disparity. Tailored treatment needs to be developed, but is almost entirely unexplored. Missing is research to evaluate the effects of PCa treatment on GBM sexual functioning, research on rehabilitation outcomes, and research to guide development of new treatments tailored to GBM and sex between men.  The long-term objective of this research is to develop the first evidence-based PCa rehabilitation curriculum tailored for GBM. As a first step, in this R21 we will conduct the formative research needed to estimate the extent of poor outcomes, confirm need, and assess acceptability and feasibility. There are three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate, in-depth, the experience of PCa treatment on the sexual lives of GBM, their partners, and their relationships. We will conduct a semi-structured, chat or phone interview study of up to 48 GBM PCa patients, partners, and couples, nationally. In Aim 2, we will refine definitions and develop the measures needed to assess sexual dysfunction in GBM. In Aim 3, we will conduct an online quantitative survey of 220 GBM with PCa, which will a) quantify sexual challenges post-treatment, b) assess needs and priorities for rehabilitation, c) develop a new scale to measure sexual functioning in GBM and d) assess the acceptability and feasibility of a new rehabilitation curriculum for GBM with PCa. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study addresses a major health disparity by investigating the experience of GBM survivors of PCa and the effects of PCa treatment. It will advance science by developing the measures necessary to study the sexual sequelae of PCa treatment in GBM. This will be the largest quantitative study of GBM with PCa conducted to date, and will provide the necessary evidence base to develop an effective rehabilitation intervention for GBM with PCa.",Understanding the Effects of Prostate Cancer on Gay and Bisexual Men,8927565,R21CA182041,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Age ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cells ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Couples ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Interview ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Paper ', ' Patients ', ' Prostatectomy ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Support Groups ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' survivorship ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' Measures ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Penetration ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Survivors ', ' Base of the Prostate ', ' Base of Human Prostate ', ' Structure of base of prostate ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Erectile dysfunction ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Anal Sex ', ' instrument ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Sex Disorders ', ' Sexual Dysfunction ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' cohort ', ' Rehabilitation Outcome ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' treatment program ', ' Reporting ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer rehab ', ' cancer rehabilitation ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' sexual functioning ', ' Sex Functioning ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', "" men's health "", ' male health ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' sexual minority ', ' screening ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' LGBTI ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex ', ' unique treatment ', ' targeted treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' individualized medicine ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2015,165300,-0.027033317033198563
"iMAN: Integrated Molecular & Affiliation Network Analysis of HIV Transmission ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a study, ""iMAN: integrated Molecular & Affiliation Network Analysis of HIV Transmission,"" which integrates molecular phylogenetic analysis with systems science methodologies to advance our understanding of the venue-based affiliation networks whereby the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is transmitted. iMAN will examine the highest HIV-risk group, young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) aged 16 to 29 in Houston, TX, and Chicago, IL, based on the cohorts of an ongoing multi-site longitudinal affiliation network project (YMAP: Young Men's Affiliation Project). iMAN aims to further advance the utility of affiliation network analysis by introducing a novel way of addressin fundamental questions about human health behavior, grounded in biological validation, to alleviate racial/ethnic health disparities in HIV-infection rates in regard to YBMSM. YBMSM socialize in a variety of contexts, both real and virtual, and these venues can involve network relationships that increase the risk of HIV/sexually-transmitted infections (STI) acquisition. Affiliation network analysis can serve as a methodological tool to investigate associations between individuals' affiliations with risky social venues and HIV risk or prevention. Affiliation network analysis alone, however, has limitations in providing grounded results. Thus, we propose to validate our findings using biological markers in the HIV virus itself. iMAN will apply phylogenetic techniques to the affiliation network analysis to simultaneously analyze social relations (epidemiology information) and molecular viral relatedness (molecular information) in a multi-level approach. iMAN proposes to use phylogenetic analysis to help characterize the clustering patterns of HIV infection within YBMSM from different patterns of venue affiliation. The objective of iMAN is to characterize the epidemiology of HIV transmission by identifying venue-based clustering of HIV-infected YBMSM across different cities using state-of-the-art molecular epidemiology methods. The resulting venue- based and genetic transmission clusters will be further examined to describe the transmission patterns of the epidemic in Houston and Chicago as well as to compare and contrast the patterns between the two cities. Our specific aims are to (1) identify HIV-transmission clusters and describe the patterns of epidemic spread by identifying (a) genetic clusters between HIV-infected YBMSM using phylogenetic analysis, and (b) venue- based social clusters using affiliation network analysis; (2) compare genetic clusters and venue-based social clusters to determine venue-based HIV risk at the local level. The findings from this research are expected to provide new directions for developing venue-based network interventions informed by molecular science and to have an impact on network interventions that target those most at risk of HIV/STI infection.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the United States, young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) have an extremely high risk of contracting the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) and are the dominant risk group. The goal of the proposed network study is to identify HIV-transmission clusters among HIV-infected YBMSM and to describe patterns of epidemic spread by integrating molecular phylogenetic analysis into affiliation network analyses. The proposed study is relevant to public health, as it addresses fundamental questions about human health behavior, grounded in biological validation, to alleviate racial/ethnic health disparities in HIV-infection rates in regard to YBMSM. The proposed study has the potential to expand the utility of systems science methodologies for understanding and addressing public health issues. This study will provide new directions for developing venue-based network interventions informed by molecular science and will have an impact on network interventions that target those most at risk of HIV/STI infection.            ",iMAN: Integrated Molecular & Affiliation Network Analysis of HIV Transmission,8924059,R21GM113694,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Genealogy ', ' Geneologies ', ' Goals ', ' Health behavior ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Infection ', ' Maps ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Trees ', ' United States ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Gays ', ' Collaborations ', ' Spottings ', ' Genetic ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' tool ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Validation ', ' Viral Epidemiology ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Molecular ', ' sexual relationship ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' virtual ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Network-based ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' young man ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2015,251745,0.013843439593334266
"Health Promotion for Positives: A Randomized Trial with HIV Positive Black Men  PROJECT SUMMARY:      This application is in response to RFA-MD-12-001, ""NIMHD Health Disparities Research (R01)."" African  American men who are infected with HIV are living longer and are being impacted by the same chronic  diseases that affect the general population of African American men over 40.  To be sure, African American  men, in general, have disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, kidney  disease, and cancer, particularly prostate and colon cancer.  However, HIV infection is associated with an  increased risk for co-morbidity from chronic diseases.  This increased risk is heightened by HIV infection, but  also its treatment with certain agents used in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) combinations.  Many  of these chronic illnesses have behavioral components-risk is influenced by what people do and don't do,  their diet, and the amount of physical activity they get.  Although the high risk for multiple behavior-linked  chronic diseases among HIV-positive individuals has been recognized, there is a lack of evidence-based  intervention specifically tailored to their needs. Hence, the broad objective is to reduce the risk of chronic  diseases among HIV positive African American men.  The Specific Aims are to test the efficacy of a theory- based, contextually appropriate health promotion intervention in inducing positive changes in behaviors linked  to risk of chronic diseases among HIV positive African American men age 40 years or older and to identify the  theoretical variables that mediate its efficacy.  The study will utilize a randomized controlled trial.  The  participants will be 384 African American HIV positive men age 40 or older who are receiving HAART for HIV.   The men will be randomized to a theory-based contextually appropriate health promotion intervention that  involves three, 3-hour weekly intervention sessions or an attention-control group.  The health promotion  intervention will be an adaptation of an intervention based on social cognitive theory integrated with formative  research and found to be efficacious in increasing adherence to 5-a-Day diet and physical activity guidelines  and prostate cancer screening guidelines in the applicants' preliminary studies.  Data will be collected at  baseline, immediately post, 3, 6 and 12 months post intervention, which will permit assessment of the short- term and long-term effects of the intervention and whether the intervention's efficacy varies over time.  Audio  computer-assisted self-interviewing will be used to assess self-reported adherence to physical activity  guidelines, 5-a-Day fruit and vegetable guidelines, prostate screening guidelines, and colon cancer screening  guidelines and theoretical mediators of behavior change.  Objective outcomes will include health-related fitness  (6-minute walk test, 1-minute push-up test, 1-minute sit-up test, sit-and-reach test), physiological variables  (blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-hip ratio), and prostate and colon cancer  screening based on medical record review.       8.  PROJECT NARRATIVE     Highly activity antiretroviral treatment (HAART) for HIV has caused dramatic decreases in HIV-related  opportunistic infections and mortality~ hence, people are living longer with HIV.  Aging is associated with  increased risk of chronic diseases, but HIV infection and HAART also heighten these risks.  Even in the  absence of HIV, African American men are at disproportionately high risk for chronic disease morbidity and  mortality.  This research, then, responds to the urgent need for interventions to reduce the risk of non-HIV  related chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes in HIV positive African  American men age 40 and older.

"Reproductive health disparities and sexual orientation in girls and women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to their heterosexual peers, sexual minority (i.e., lesbian and bisexual) female youth are particularly vulnerable to having poor health, especially poor reproductive health. Emerging research shows that the health of sexual minorities can be adversely affected by state-level discriminatory laws. This discrimination can occur in states that have failed to enact protections around hate crimes, job discrimination, or same-sex marriage. However, little is known about the association of these types of public policies with reproductive health. Policy environments are also highly variable across U.S. states and dynamic across time, as demonstrated by the U.S. Supreme Court overturning the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013. Therefore, this research is vital for understanding how the rapidly shifting policy environment may affect sexual minorities. Empirical evidence is needed to inform new public policy development and public health strategies to improve reproductive health, but few researchers have the training needed to explore such disparities and translate findings into action.  In the proposed project, Dr. Charlton argues that public policy may be associated with the reproductive health of sexual minority girls and women. She will explore this through the following aims: (1) Identify how public policy may be associated with the reproductive health of sexual minority girls and women; (2) Elucidate what adverse reproductive health outcomes may be associated with public policy among sexual minority girls and women and where these reproductive health outcomes occur; and (3) Examine potential reasons why adverse reproductive health outcomes disproportionately burden sexual minority girls and women. To fulfill these aims, national data will be analyzed from two longitudinal cohorts of adolescents and young adults (Growing Up Today Study I/II) along with a cohort of their mothers (Nurses' Health Study II).  In order complete the proposed research, Dr. Charlton must build on her epidemiology skills with formal training in health-related public policy. As such, her mentors have developed a plan to advance her training in areas such as policy analysis and econometrics. This training will enable her to create a comprehensive database representing the various policy environments in every U.S. state and analyze how this environment is associated with the reproductive health of sexual minority girls and women. The proposed research is in line with the NICHD Office of Health Equity's initiatives and will be among the firs to examine public policy and a range of reproductive health issues among sexual minority girls and women. Dr. Charlton will have access is to uniquely detailed data and her findings will further the understanding of sexual orientation health disparities and promote research in diverse populations. This training and research will give Dr. Charlton a solid foundation in health-related public policy, which, combined with her epidemiology background, will enable her to build a career as an independent research scientist.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will explore the association of discriminatory public policies (e.g., same-sex marriage bans) and the reproductive health of sexual minority girls and women, a population that experiences a disproportionate burden of reproductive disease. The results of this project can help clarify mechanisms of health risk as well as potential interventions for health promotion. In doing so, this project has high potential for publc health impact because it can inform future interventions and the development of health-related public policy strategies.            ",Reproductive health disparities and sexual orientation in girls and women,8900467,F32HD084000,"['adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' Crime ', ' Data Collection ', ' Daughter ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Hate ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Laws ', ' Marriage ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Nurses ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Underage Pregnancy ', ' Teenage Pregnancy ', ' Teen Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Minors ', ' Adolescent Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Adolescence ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Policy ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Unplanned pregnancy ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Competence ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' career ', ' court ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Solid ', ' Medical ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Policies ', ' Lesbian ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Shapes ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' reproductive ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' girls ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Policy Research ', ' Research Training ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', "" Nurses' Health Study "", ' Heterosexuals ', ' initiation of intercourse ', ' early sexual initiation ', ' early sex initiation ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' initiation of sexual activity ', ' sexual debut ', ' sexual minority ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' same-sex marriage ', ' ']",NICHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,F32,2015,55190,0.0204600370480087
"Parenting and Men's Health: The Utility of the Fathers and Sons Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the public health significance of problems such as substance abuse and depression among African American men, few evidence-based prevention strategies have been developed for these men and even fewer have focused on a strategy that uses their role as a father as a protection against poor health outcomes. This application proposes to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the Fathers and Sons Program for reducing depression and drinking behavior and increasing substance use and mental health service utilization among nonresident African American fathers. It focuses on enhancing fathers' parenting knowledge, attitudes and behaviors, connectedness with their sons, and awareness and use of community resources. This theoretically-based, gender-specific, culturally relevant, family-centered program was originally designed to enhance parenting attitudes and behaviors among nonresident African American fathers and strengthen their relationship with their preadolescent sons as a way to prevent youth risky behaviors. It was developed using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to increase its relevance and appeal to the intended audiences. Preliminary evidence suggests the program is promising for improving health behaviors and well-being among fathers as well. Our goal is to conduct a randomized control trial to evaluate the program for its long-term health benefits for both fathers and sons. The results of the original Fathers and Sons intervention program will be compared to a control group that will receive a family-based program focused on physical activity and nutrition. Because fathers and sons participate in the Fathers and Sons programs together, we will have the added benefit of examining how influencing father's parenting attitudes and behaviors affect their sons' health behaviors, offering intergenerational perspectives on men's health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application proposes to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the Fathers and Sons Program for reducing depression and drinking behavior, and increasing service use among nonresident African American fathers with preadolescent sons.

Because fathers and sons participate in the program together, we will have the added benefit of examining how influencing fathers' parenting attitudes and behaviors affect their sons' health behaviors, offering intergenerational perspectives on men's health.            ",Parenting and Men's Health: The Utility of the Fathers and Sons Program,8941751,R01HD084526,"['Affect ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' health attitude ', ' Attitude to Health ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Employment ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Social Identity ', ' Social Identification ', ' Son ', ' Stress ', ' fabric ', ' Textiles ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Competence ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Health Benefit ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Masculine ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' fatherhood ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' intergenerational ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' paternity ', ' father role ', ' drinking ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Emotional ', ' boys ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Subgroup ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' drinking behavior ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', "" men's health "", ' male health ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' initiation of sexual activity ', ' sexual debut ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,614043,-0.011492230043116895
"The Construction of Power, IPV and HIV risk among Meth-Using Men and Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intimate partner violence (IPV), defined as physical and sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner, poses a significant public health problem in the United States. According to CDC's 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, more than 1 in 3 women and more than 1 in 4 men reported ever having experienced IPV. Research supports a number of risk factors related primarily to female victimization including: socio-demographic variables, sexual-risk behaviors, drug use, past abuse, etc. as well as emerging evidence for risk factors unique to abused males including gender expectations, stigma, and poor social support. Literature on the relationship between drug use and IPV indicates that methamphetamine (meth) use is independently associated with IPV among male, female and couple drug-users. Meth-use has been associated with impaired judgment, poor decision-making ability, and poor sexual relationship power (SRP), all which contribute to increased sexual risk behaviors and consequently, HIV infection. Power is defined as a multidimensional concept that involves a degree of inequity in the distribution of resources and is embodied in one's personal control and ability to influence the behaviors of others. While power is most commonly conceptualized in the form of SRP within IPV research, more recent studies have documented the role of social and structural sources of power in predicting risk of HIV and IPV. The specific aims of the proposed project are to quantitatively: 1) assess the relationship between sexual relationship power (SRP) and IPV among HIV-negative, heterosexual meth-using women and men, and 2) examine gender differences in risk factors (e.g. socio-demographic variables, SRP, condom use, drug use) associated with recent IPV using an existing data set from an HIV behavioral intervention study (FASTLANE2) conducted in 2001-2005. This study also aims to qualitatively: 3) describe the construction of power at the individual, social and structural levels and how this is related to IPV and sexual risk-taking, and 4) describe the relationship between power, IPV and sexual risk-taking behaviors within the context of meth-use. For the qualitative portion of this study we will recruit a sample of 60 heterosexual meth-using men and women (30 men and 30 women) who reside in San Diego County. Participants will be asked to complete one in-depth interview consisting of close and open-ended questions on personal characteristics, drug use, sexual risk behaviors, experience of IPV, power within their relationship, and neighborhood and social support characteristics. This research will add to the current literature by: 1) exploring gender differences in the risk factors related to IPV, 2) describing the construction of power at the individual, social and structural levels and how this impacts HIV risk behaviors and IPV; and 3) describing the relationship between power, IPV and sexual risk-taking within the context of meth-use. The long term goal of this work is to inform the creation of interventions tailored to the specific risk facors of IPV and HIV including poor power and related sexual-risk taking faced by meth-using men and women.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Research that supports excess burden of intimate partner violence (IPV) and HIV risk among meth-users illustrates a complex relationship that includes both indirect and direct pathways that independently connect meth-use, IPV, and HIV risk. Despite support for this relationship, the majority of the existing research is limited in that it:1) focuses primarily on female victimization, neglecting to approach the topics of male victimization, 2) focuses on individual and interpersonal factors, without taking into account how social and structural factors play a role in IPV and associated HIV risk, and 3) does not thoroughly examine the role of meth-use in IPV and HIV risk. Given research that support meth-users as high-risk individuals for both IPV and HIV risk, this research will provide valuable insight into an extremely vulnerable and understudied population to ultimately inform the development of more culturally sensitive and relevant interventions that target IPV, power and HIV risk among meth-using men and women.            ","The Construction of Power, IPV and HIV risk among Meth-Using Men and Women",8846909,R36DA039012,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Judgment ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Literature ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' N-Methylamphetamine ', ' Methylamphetamine ', ' Desoxyephedrine ', ' Deoxyephedrine ', ' Crystal Meth ', ' Benzeneethanamine, N,alpha-dimethyl-, (S)- ', ' Methamphetamine ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Play ', ' Power Supplies ', ' Power Sources ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' United States ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Area ', ' racism ', ' Sexism ', ' Gender Bias ', ' Sex Bias ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Drug user ', ' Nature ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Complex ', ' experience ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Exclusion Criteria ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' sexual relationship ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' neglect ', ' Interpersonal Violence ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' high risk ', ' sexual violence ', ' public health relevance ', ' sexual risk taking ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R36,2015,65682,0.04034836353614303
"Translating the Diabetes Prevention Program to Engage Men in Disadvantaged Areas DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rising epidemic of type 2 diabetes is a major cause of disability and death. With an estimated cost of $245 billion in 2012, diabetes also represents a significant burden to the U.S. health care system. Following the successful trial of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in 2002, the translation of this lifestyle intervention to community settings has been a major public health focus, with significant support from the CDC through the National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP). Although the NDPP has been shown to be effective for enrolled participants, resulting in weight loss of 5-7%, independent of setting and population group, there are striking disparities in engagement. Participation rates for men are particularly low (often <30% of a class); participation rates for Black and Latino men are even lower (<20%). Men generally have poorer health outcomes and lower life expectancies than women. Men of color, who are more likely than their white counterparts to face significant disadvantage, experience higher rates of diabetes-related complications, such as cardiovascular disease and end-stage renal disease. Given the disproportionate burden of diabetes and its complications for disadvantaged groups, targeted diabetes prevention programming is a crucial component of public health planning. This proposal is for a translational, cluster randomized trial of the NDPP in 16 sites for the main study, tailored to recruit, engage and retain men from disadvantaged communities in type 2 diabetes prevention. The proposed tailored program, the NDPPB, will first be pilot tested with 30 men in 2 sites before being implemented in 8 NYC Parks and Recreation Department (REC) sites in disadvantaged communities in each of the 5 boroughs of NYC, with 8 standard NDPP REC sites for comparison. Working in collaboration with a stakeholder Advisory Panel of community leaders and academic experts, we will conduct focused outreach to the target population. We will implement the evidence-based NDPP curriculum, with tailoring to promote increased engagement of men. For our proposal, ""engagement"" encompasses recruitment, group participation, and retention. We propose having male-only coaches and groups members, adaptations to the dietary messaging, and increased emphasis on physical activity. For comparison, the standard mixed-gender groups will be implemented at eight separate REC sites, matched by NYC borough, using the standard NDPP curriculum. In the main study, we will enroll a total of 830 participants (age 18 and older) across the 16 REC sites. The specific aims of the proposed study are: 1) to assess the effectiveness of the NDPPB with respect to reductions in BMI (primary outcome) compared to the standard NDPP model. We hypothesize that men engaged in the NDPPB will have reductions in BMI at 16 weeks at least equivalent to those in the standard NDPP; 2) to examine the extent to which recruitment/enrollment, intervention and retention strategies tailored for men at risk for type 2 diabetes in disadvantaged communities are associated with improved engagement of the target population (secondary outcomes). We hypothesize that implementation of the NDPPB will proceed with more rapid recruitment and enrollment of men than in the standard NDPP; 3) to identify demographic, psychosocial, neighborhood, and REC site characteristics associated with differential recruitment and intervention effects; and 4) to provide estimates of incremental costs of the NDPPB in comparison to the standard community-based NDPP programs and relative to the primary outcome of change in BMI. Strengths of our proposal include: rigorous design and analytic methodologies, with randomization by site, a participatory approach and an adaptive process for development of our intervention with the NYC REC sites, along with a strong community and expert Advisory Panel. If our hypotheses are supported, this study will inform real-world implementation of the NDPP program in community settings for high-risk men and make a significant contribution to reducing the diabetes burden in these populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health relevance of this proposal is that although the National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) has been shown to be effective in preventing or delaying type 2 diabetes for enrolled participants, there are disparities in enrollment and engagement by men, especially those from disadvantaged communities. If our hypotheses are supported, this study with its recruitment strategies and adapted curriculum will inform real- world implementation of the NDPP program in accessible community settings for men and will make a significant contribution to reducing the diabetes burden in these high-risk populations.",Translating the Diabetes Prevention Program to Engage Men in Disadvantaged Areas,8908010,R18DK102080,"['Age ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' foot ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Planning ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Recreation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Physical activity ', ' disability ', ' Collaborations ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' programs ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Leg ', ' Population Group ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' ']",NIDDK,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R18,2015,189762,0.046267384318112795
"Trauma, Microfinance and HIV Risk Behaviors in DRCongo DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pervasive sexual and gender based violence (SGBV) in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) causes severe outcomes for the physical, psychological, and economic health of young women. Research is currently being conducted to determine the effects of village-led microfinance in reintegrating SGBV survivors into their families and communities to improve women's physical, psychological, and economic health. However, current research has shown that post-rape services are not reaching young unmarried women between the ages 15 to 24 in the region. Young women of this age are highly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, particularly after a traumatic event such as an incident of SGBV. This study will investigate how microfinance affects the mental health and HIV sexual risk behavior of young unmarried women within an existing study.  Research participants will be asked to self-report HIV sexual risk behavior in a series of survey questions. Risk behaviors such as multiple sexual partners and condom usage will be measured at baseline, and 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-baseline. A secondary data analysis will be conducted comparing HIV sexual risk behavior with demographic and mental health measures over time. Although sexual risk behavior data will be collected for 500 women in both the microfinance intervention group (n=250) compared to the delayed control group (n=250), this study will focus on the effects of microfinance on HIV sexual risk behaviors of young unmarried women between the ages of 15-24. It is hypothesized that young unmarried women in the intervention group will report fewer sexual risk behaviors than women in the delayed control group.  In-depth qualitative interviews with a subsample of young unmarried women (n=50, five from each of the ten villages) will explore reasons behind status of health, mental health, and HIV sexual risk behavior. Of particular interest in these interviews is the relationship between conflict-setting and SGBV trauma, a microfinance intervention, and sexual risk behavioral outcomes. Interviews will be conducted at baseline and 18 months post-intervention to compare the types of responses and evaluate the impact of microfinance in the lives of young unmarried women with regards to coping with traumatic experiences and impact on HIV sexual risk behaviors. Collaboration between the study investigator and local Congolese experts trained in sensitive (to SGBV survivors) research methods will explore how trauma survivors view microfinance and if microfinance has affected their sexual risk behaviors. Acknowledging safety concerns for participants and researchers in this conflict setting, every precaution will be taken through the complex safety system that Congolese partners have developed over the past fifteen years of successfully working in this conflict setting. Interviews will take place in a safe participant-selected setting for 90 minutes, asking open-ended questions, and only exploring what young women are comfortable with. This study investigates how microfinance affects the mental health outcomes and HIV/AIDS sexual risk behaviors of young unmarried women participating in an existing research study in the post-conflict setting of Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Mixed-methods (quantitative and qualitative) research will explore how young female trauma survivors are affected by a microfinance intervention and the intervention's impact on sexual risk behaviors.","Trauma, Microfinance and HIV Risk Behaviors in DRCongo",8913706,F31MH095678,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Communities ', ' information privacy ', ' Confidentiality ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Female ', ' Glass ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Household ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Judgment ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Rape ', ' Forcible intercourse ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' self esteem ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Shame ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Zaire ', ' Congo (Kinshasa) ', ' Belgian Congo ', ' Democratic Republic of the Congo ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Unmarried ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Survivors ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' emergency contraception ', ' experience ', ' Responsible sexual behavior ', ' Responsible Sex ', ' Protected Sex ', ' Safe Sex ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' minority health ', ' post intervention ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' health economics ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' aged ', ' Trauma ', ' sexual violence ', ' group intervention ', ' young woman ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2015,41270,0.05826357239682748
"HIV Risk Among Trans Partners of MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION: HIV disparities in the U.S. continue to affect the most marginalized groups in this culture. Trans women are 34 times more likely than MSM to contract HIV. Estimated prevalence rates for trans men ranged from 0 to 3%, significantly lower than for trans women, yet considerable unprotected anal and vaginal sex behaviors, sex work and drug use, all known risk factors for HIV, were reported. Prior research among trans women found that rates of unprotected vaginal and anal intercourse were higher with primary partners versus casual or commercial sex partners. This is true for MSM in relationships as well. Yet we know very little about trans persons in primary relationships. Early research by the PI found unique relationship factors associated with risk among MSM couples. We will explore relationship factors for trans men and women in relationship with cis gendered men to identify unique relationship factors associated with risk. We will conduct qualitative interviews with 50 couples comprised of 25 trans women in a primary relationship with a cis man and 25 trans men in a relationship with a cis man. Interviews will be guided by minority stress theory and focus on the intersection of gender identity, ethnic identity and relationship dynamics associated with sexual risk for these groups. Data will be disseminated to community groups and used as the basis for a future intervention study.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV risk behaviors are high among trans men and trans women. HIV prevalence and incidence is particularly high among trans women. Despite this, very little research has been done to identify determinants of risk for these groups. The proposed study will investigate important relationship factors that are associated with risk among trans men and women in relationships with cis gendered men. This is needed because traditional definitions of relationship, gender and sexual origination are no longer binary. We need to understand the intersections of these identities in the context of relationship so that we can develop meaningful HIV prevention interventions. This study will begin to bridge gender identity, ethnic identity and relationship dynamics to understand risk profiles in the context of relationship for trans men and women in relationships with cis gendered men.                    ",HIV Risk Among Trans Partners of MSM,8846258,R21AI116297,"['Affect ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Couples ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Persons ', ' parity ', ' Play ', ' survival sex ', ' commercial sex work ', ' commercial sex ', ' Prostitution ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Hospital Risk Reporting ', ' Risk Management ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' satisfaction ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Gays ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' transsexual ', ' transgender ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' intimacy ', ' intimate behavior ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' Reporting ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' risk perception ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' trend ', ' sex ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical practice ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' LGBT Health ', ' ']",NIAID,SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,255018,0.009014050489201907
"Social determinants of male-male sexual violence victimization and perpetration a DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A recent population-based, household survey of South African men found that nearly 1 in 10 men reported having been sexually assaulted by another man during their lifetime.1 Further examination of this figure uncovers a significant disparity in sexual violence victimization risk: men who report a history of (consensual) sex with men (MSM) are over four times more likely than non-MSM to report male-male sexual violence victimization (34.4% versus 8.1%, p=0.00) as well as perpetration (10.9% versus 2.6%, p=0.00).1  A growing body of public health research and prevention work has emerged to address high rates of sexual violence victimization among South African women, yet the sexual violence risks faced by MSM and other men remain largely unexamined, and the corresponding prevention needs of men have been overwhelmingly neglected. Further, evidence of hypothesized linkages between experiences of male-male sexual violence, sexual risk behaviors, and sexually transmitted infections remains limited in this setting.  The study presented here is an initial effort to examine potential risk and protective factors for male- male sexual violence victimization and perpetration among South African MSM. The study holds the following set of specific aims: Aim 1: To determine the 12-month and lifetime prevalence rates of male-male sexual violence victimization and perpetration among a clinic-based sample of 500 MSM; Aim 2: To evaluate a proposed conceptual model of male-male sexual violence victimization, adapted from the Theory of Gender & Power, using structural equation modeling; Aim 3: To evaluate a proposed conceptual model of male-male sexual violence perpetration, adapted from the Confluence Model of Sexual Aggression, using structural equation modeling; and Aim 4: To compare key sexual health behaviors and outcomes, including clinical measures of STI infections, practice of unprotected anal and vaginal sex, and sexual partner concurrency by history of sexual violence victimization and perpetration.  To accomplish these aims, the study will recruit a sample of 500 MSM, at least 18 years old, from two public men's sexual health clinics in Cape Town, South Africa. Participants will be asked to complete a computer-administered questionnaire and undergo syphilis and HIV rapid testing. Questionnaire topics include: community norms, relationships, and social life; gender; conflict and violence; sexual behaviors; and alcohol use. Binomial logistic regression and structural equation modeling will be used during data analysis.  The study extends the application of a gender-based social theory commonly applied in studies of female rape victimization and builds on the existing psychological model that has predominately been used to study sexual aggression. The study findings will have significant implications for clinical practice, public health theory, and the development of interventions to prevent and mitigate the impact of male-male sexual violence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study offers a novel in-depth analysis of male-male sexual violence among South African MSM, thereby addressing a poorly understood but highly prevalent public health issue within a population that has been identified at high risk. This study explores how interactions between social structures and social norms may contribute to the sexual violence experiences of MSM, and explores linkages between violent experiences, sexual risk behaviors, and sexually transmitted infections.

"Racial differences in low-income Men's fertility intentions and behavior DESCRIPTION: Unintended pregnancy is a substantial problem in the United States, with adverse consequences for women, their children, and society. Unintended pregnancy is especially prevalent among low-income and minority populations, and such disparities contribute to the cycle of disadvantage experienced by vulnerable populations. Our ongoing work examining how socio-cultural factors contribute to poor contraceptive behaviors among low-income, African-American and white women has revealed that pregnancy-promoting and coercive behavior by their male partners may play a significant role in the high unintended pregnancy rates observed in these populations. National and international family planning advocates and guidelines are calling for engaging men more actively in contraceptive decision making, yet the dearth of literature on men's attitudes towards contraceptive use and pregnancy and how attitudes may vary by race curtails the development of culturally-relevant interventions. Therefore, gaining insight into men's fertility-related attitudes and behaviors is a critical next step. We propose to conduct a qualitative study utilizing in-depth interviews with 60 low-income, adult AA and white men in Pittsburgh to gain insight about men's fertility intentions and behavior in a population that is at high risk of unintended pregnancy. A particular focus of this study will be to examine attitudes and social norms regarding reproductive coercion as one potential end of the spectrum of male fertility behavior. We will also pay close attention to themes that appear to be unique to each of the two racial groups. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) describe the spectrum of fertility intentions and behaviors among low-income men, 2) explore the relationship between men's fertility intentions and behaviors; and 3) understand how cultural and structural factors shape men's fertility intentions and behaviors. As male partners appear to play a significant role in pregnancy decisions and outcomes, there is a need to better understand their contextualized perspectives on contraception, pregnancy, and parenthood. This study will complement our ongoing qualitative work with women to provide a more complete picture of the factors that influence family planning and allow us to pinpoint specific contextual factors that contribute to poor contraceptive behaviors and risk for unintended pregnancy among low-income, AA and white populations in Pittsburgh, PA. The ultimate goal of this research is to empower women and men, regardless of race or socioeconomic status, to make effective reproductive decisions and reduce unintended and/or unilaterally- desired pregnancies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unintended pregnancy is an enormous problem in the United States, and racial/ethnic minorities are at particularly high risk. Given that male partners influence reproductive decisions and outcomes, understanding men's fertility-related attitudes and behaviors and how these vary by race may provide more insights to understand the observed racial disparity in unintended pregnancy rates. This research will lay the groundwork for culturally-relevant programs that seek to bridge men's and women's fertility goals and maximize the potential for increasing the proportion of pregnancies that are congruently and consciously desired.",Racial differences in low-income Men's fertility intentions and behavior,8839806,R21HD076327,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Coercion ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Family Planning ', ' Contraceptive Behavior ', ' Contraception Behavior ', ' Contraceptives ', ' Contraceptive Agents ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' Couples ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' Fertility ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Control Locus ', ' Low Income Population ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Play ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy Rate ', ' pressure ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Sexuality ', ' Societies ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Guidelines ', ' insight ', ' social norm ', ' Shapes ', ' fatherhood ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Inhibition of Fertilization ', ' Fertility Control ', ' Contraception ', ' Contraceptive methods ', ' reproductive ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Low income ', ' Advocate ', ' International ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' comparative ', ' high risk ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2015,186634,0.03957641059953345
"Juvenile Court Approaches to Reduce Reproductive Health Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial and ethnic minority youth are disproportionately represented in the juvenile justice (JJ) system, just as they are overrepresented among those living in poverty, those growing up in disorganized neighborhood environments and those with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unwanted pregnancies. Multiple societal and structural factors are associated with poorer sexual health outcomes for these youth, including limited access to, and availability of, health care services and their socia (and sexual transmission) networks. JJ youth are likely to accrue further legal charges and be incarcerated into adulthood, thereby perpetuating racial and ethnic health disparities within the adult criminal justice system. Despite that racial and ethnic disparities exist in both health and legal systems, the relationship between juvenile justice involvement and health (including sexual) disparities is highly understudied. Constitutional mandates require access to medical testing and treatment in correctional settings, including free access to sexual health care services; however, confined juveniles only represent approximately twenty percent of arrested youth and the current trend in juvenile justice is away from confinement. Waiting until youth are confined to provide increased access to sexual health services misses a tremendous opportunity to improve sexual health outcomes and reduce disparities for a broader group of juveniles. The objective of this study is therefore to provide data that will inform public health and juvenile justice structural intervention development and policy geared toward increasing access to and uptake of sexual health prevention, treatment, care and support services for court- involved, non-incarcerated (CINI) youth. We seek to collect qualitative and quantitative data from juvenile court and department of health key informants that will provide novel documentation of the barriers to and facilitators of increasing access to and uptake of sexual health services for CINI juveniles. A combination of qualitative semistructured interviews and a large-scale survey of a diverse US sample of court and department of health settings (N=300 respondents) will provide data on system attitudes, perceptions, practices and policies that limit or enable access to sexual health services for CINI juveniles.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Juvenile justice youth are at risk for poorer sexual health outcomes such as HIV, other sexually transmitted infections and unintended teenage pregnancies. Racial and ethnic disparities in sexual health outcomes and criminal justice involvement appear inextricably intertwined and yet little attention has been paid to how juvenile justice and public health systems could most successfully partner to reduce juvenile sexual health disparities. This study will provide data from a diverse US sample of court and department of health settings to understand system-level attitudes, perceptions, practices and policies that limit or enable access to sexual health services for court-involved, non-incarcerated (CINI) juveniles. Data will inform structural intervention development and policy geared toward increasing access to and uptake of sexual health prevention, treatment, care and support services for CINI youth.

"Gender Difference in Bladder Cancer Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Men are 3-4 times more likely to develop bladder cancer (BCa) than women are. In fact, the incidence of almost all types of cancer is consistently higher in males than in females. The key difference in genetic makeup between males and females is the sex chromosome complement (XX versus XY). We do not know, however, the extent to which sex chromosomes are responsible for the gender difference of BCa susceptibility. Neither do we know whether sex chromosomes enhance or reduce the gonadal hormone-dependent sexually dimorphic phenotypes. Epigenetic programming in the sexual dimorphism is an emerging field. At present, essentially nothing is known about the epigenetic mechanism of the gender difference in BCa susceptibility. Many epigenetic programs regulate histone methylation to maintain active or silent states of chromatin. The X- linked histone demethylase, Utx/Kdm6a, is an epigenetic regulator that functions in a sex-specific manner during development; this gene is mutated in over 25% of human BCa cases. Furthermore, mutation rates of epigenetic regulators are significantly higher in human BCa than all other epithelial cancers studied in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) projects. Thus, the X-linked, Utx-dependent epigenetic program may impart sex-specific gene expression differences in bladder urothelium, and consequently influence BCa susceptibility. To address questions highlighted above, we will first use a novel mouse model, which consist of the ""four core genotypes""-XX and XY- females with ovaries, and XY-Sry and XXSry males with testes-to investigate whether the gender difference in BCa susceptibility depends on the sex chromosome complement and/or the gonadal types. Second, we will determine whether the Utx-dependent epigenetic program causes the sex disparity in BCa incidence using a mouse conditional knockout (cKO) strategy. Third, we will use genomic technology to identify sexually dimorphic genetic and epigenetic targets of the Utx-dependent epigenetic program. Identification of these molecular features may shed light onto the underlying epigenetic mechanism of the sex disparities of BCa. Together, the proposed studies will significantly improve our understanding of the gender difference in BCa susceptibility, and may substantially alter our view of the emerging paradigm of epigenetic programing in the sex disparities in cancer incidence, and could potentially lead to future epigenetic-based treatment strategies to BCa.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Men are 3-4 times more likely to develop bladder cancer than women are, but the underlying mechanism in essentially unknown. The 5-year survival rate of metastatic bladder cancer is less than 5%. Cigarette smoking is the #1 risk factor; however, smoking itself can not explain the gender differences in bladder cancer incidence. The proposed study investigates other potential risk factors, and suggests epigenetic reprograming may play a major role in bladder cancer susceptibility and sex disparities.            ",Gender Difference in Bladder Cancer Susceptibility,8959213,R21CA198544,"['Acetylation ', ' Age ', ' Variance Analyses ', ' ANOVA ', ' Analysis of Variance ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' Bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' oncogenic agent ', ' Oncogens ', ' Cancer Causing Agents ', ' Carcinogens ', ' Chromatin ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Histone H3 ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' L-Lysine ', ' Lysine ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Muscle ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Ovary ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' chromosome complement ', ' DNA Ploidy ', ' DNA Index ', ' DNA Content ', ' Ploidies ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Gonosomes ', ' Sex Chromosomes ', ' Smoking ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Testicles ', ' Testis ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' X Chromosome ', ' Y Chromosome ', ' Gender ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Sexism ', ' Gender Bias ', ' Sex Bias ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Epithelial ', ' Urothelium ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Gonadal Hormones ', ' Genetic ', ' programs ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' Responsible sexual behavior ', ' Responsible Sex ', ' Protected Sex ', ' Safe Sex ', ' sex dimorphism ', ' sexual dimorphism ', ' demethylation ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' Address ', ' Bladder Transitional Cell Epithelium ', ' Bladder Urothelium ', ' Mutate ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Molecular ', ' Knockout ', ' Knock-out ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' transcriptome ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cancer type ', ' mouse model ', ' tumor ', ' treatment strategy ', ' TCGA ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2015,192216,0.016957545197656746
"Cancer-Health Disparities in Incarcerated Men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this NCI K22 career development proposal is to develop the PI, a PhD, and trained social worker in health disparities, into a successfully funded independent cancer researcher. The proposal contains both career development and structured research plan activities focus on advancing cancer-health disparities research with incarcerated men. Incarcerated men have not generally been the focus of cancer health studies although multiple reports indicate that approximately 60-80% of inmates in the United States have histories of tobacco use, compared to 30% of the general population, and over 80% of individuals involved in the criminal justice system report histories of substance use, including alcohol, marijuana and crack cocaine. This is an alarming statistic, considering that tobacco, marijuana, crack cocaine, and alcohol use are associated with an increased risk of developing lung and liver diseases and certain cancers. Little is known about incarcerated men's cancer-health disparities and how incarceration affects their health behaviors upon release to the community. This program builds upon the PI's prior work including her strong background in HIV/AIDS research, clinical practice, and mixed-methods research experience. The specific career goals are: (1) to become proficient in research skills, focusing on advanced quantitative methods, data analysis and grant writing (enroll in cancer epidemiology and longitudinal research courses); and (2) to gain experience in prison cancer-health disparities research (collecting primary cancer- health disparities data across three different correctional facilities). The proposed research will assess the cancer-health disparities and smoking behaviors of men ages 18 years and over who are currently incarcerated in facilities of three different security levels (i.e., detention, minimum, and medium). The specific aims are to: (1) assess the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about cancer and describe the smoking behaviors of incarcerated men; and (2) adapt the Cancer 101 (a cancer education resource to improve cancer knowledge, survival rates and cancer control in vulnerable populations) for incarcerated men in three different correctional settings. The results from the K22 described in this proposal are intended to inform the basis of a NCI R01 grant application. The long-term goal is to design and implement a culturally appropriate prison-to-community cancer-health prevention trial for incarcerated men returning to their communities in order to ultimately reduce the cancer burden affecting men with criminal justice backgrounds. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer-related disparities are not well understood as they apply to incarcerated populations. The proposed award explores cancer health and cancer education in men who are incarcerated.

"Ectopic adiposity in black men with high type 2 diabetes risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) disproportionately affect black individuals. Generalized obesity and other established risk factors do not explain the racial disparity in T2D, and this is particularly evident among men. Emerging evidence indicates that fat accumulation in non-adipose tissues (referred to as ectopic adiposity) may be associated with T2D, independent of general obesity. Compared to white men, both obese and lean black men have less visceral and liver adiposity, while in contrast, they paradoxically have more skeletal muscle adiposity. Skeletal muscle is crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis, and thus, skeletal muscle adiposity may be the key adipose tissue depot contributing to increased T2D risk in blacks. However, much remains to be learned about the epidemiology of skeletal muscle adiposity, particularly among high-risk black populations. Through the K01 (DK083029) and R03 (DK092348) funded pilot studies for new investigators, the applicant has begun to investigate the epidemiology of skeletal muscle adiposity and other ectopic adipose tissue depots in a well-characterized, large cohort of black men from the Tobago Health Study. This cohort offers a unique opportunity to study a black population with low levels of total adiposity, and low prevalence of other potential confounding variables, but with a high prevalence of T2D, especially among non- obese men. We are proposing to continue and expand upon our preliminary research on ectopic adiposity in this cohort. We will take advantage of our unique resource of archived computed tomography (CT) scan image files from over 1500 black men, aged 40 years and above, to analyze skeletal muscle adiposity changes over an average of nearly 7 years, and characterize the natural history of skeletal muscle adiposity changes with aging in black men, and the temporal relationship of these changes with glucose and insulin homeostasis. We will also use archived biological specimens to measure physiologic markers of potential importance for skeletal muscle adiposity, and test several compelling hypotheses about the etiology and consequences of skeletal muscle adiposity. In addition, we will obtain new CT measures of visceral, liver, abdominal muscle and pericardial adiposity, and will test for an association of abdominal skeletal muscle adiposity with measures of glucose and insulin homeostasis, and determine if these associations are independent of liver, visceral and pericardial adiposity. The proposed study will greatly advance our understanding of ectopic adiposity and its role in T2D among high risk black men. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are escalating at alarming rates and disproportionately affect black individuals.

"Sexual Orientation and Obesity:  Test of a Gendered Biopsychosocial Model DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant: Sexual Orientation and Obesity: Test of a Gendered Biopsychosocial Model Obesity is one of the most critical public health issues affecting the U.S. today. Racial and socioeconomic disparities in the determinants, distribution, and consequences of obesity are receiving increasing attention; however, one area that is only beginning to be recognized is the striking interplay of gender and sexual orientation in obesity disparities. It is now well-established that women of minority sexual orientation are disproportionately affected by the obesity epidemic, with nearly three-quarters of adult lesbians overweight or obese, compared to half of heterosexual women. In stark contrast, among men, heterosexual males have nearly double the risk of obesity compared to gay males. Despite clear evidence from descriptive epidemiologic research that sexual orientation and gender markedly pattern obesity disparities, there is almost no prospective, analytic epidemiologic research into the causes of these disparities. It will be impossible to develop evidence-based preventive interventions unless we first answer basic questions about causal pathways, as we plan to do. Our study has high potential for public health impact not only for sexual minorities but also for heterosexuals, as we seek to uncover how processes of gender socialization may exacerbate obesity risk in both sexual minority females and heterosexual males. In response to PA-07-409 ""Health Research with Diverse Populations,"" we will rigorously test our innovative gendered biopsychosocial model that is both multilevel and multisystem to explain observed sexual orientation disparities in obesity. We will use longitudinal, repeated measures survey data and also biological data from three youth cohorts: Growing Up Today Study (GUTS) 1 & 2 and National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), all ongoing prospective cohorts that together total over 47,000 youth living throughout the United States.

Women of minority sexual orientation are disproportionately affected by the obesity epidemic, with nearly three-quarters of lesbians overweight or obese, compared to half of heterosexual women. In addition, heterosexual men have almost double the obesity risk as gay men. With both substantial burden and pronounced gender modification now documented, these disparities are of high public-health significance.

" A  Multilevel Analysis of Partner Violence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Globally, research on intimate partner violence (IPV) is based on women's reported exposure, with little known about the determinants of men's perpetration. Nascent evidence in poorer settings suggests that childhood experiences and local gender norms may synergistically influence men's risks of perpetration, but these risk factors have not been studied together. In historically patriarchal settings like Bangladesh, norms among senior men about equity-inequity in gender relations and violence against women may influence those of lower-status community members, including younger men. Compared to more senior men, younger men are more likely to be establishing patterns of behavior in marriage, and their behaviors, including the perpetration of IPV, may be more amenable to change. AIMS. Using data from a population- based survey of men in Bangladesh, we will develop and test a novel measurement model for senior men's community-level gender norms. We will use this measure in a multilevel analysis to explore whether living amidst local norms among senior men favoring gender equity and disfavoring violence against women lowers the risk of perpetrating physical IPV among younger men, either directly, and/or by buffering the influence of younger men's exposure to violence in childhood. DATA. The sample includes 961 senior men 35-49 years (y) and 564 ever-married men 18-34 y nested in 50 urban and 65 rural communities who took part in the survey of Men's Attitudes and Practices Regarding Gender and Violence Against Women in Bangladesh. METHODS. We will use 3-level item response theory (IRT) methods to explore and refine the measurement of community- level gender norms among senior men, including an assessment of the measure's dimensionality, reliability, measurement invariance across urban and rural communities, and within-community heterogeneity. We will use multilevel logistic regression to assess (1) the relationship between community gender norms and a younger ever-married man's probability of perpetrating any prior-year physical IPV and (2) whether the association of a younger man's exposure to violence in childhood with his probability of perpetrating recent physical IPV depends on community-level gender norms. Sensitivity analyses will test the robustness of the findings. INNOVATION. Globally, research is lacking on (1) men's perpetration of IPV and (2) the measurement of community-level gender norms among men using advanced methods. Thus, little is known about the associations of community-level gender norms (developed through such measurement models) with younger men's perpetration of IPV, directly and by buffering the potentially adverse influence of childhood exposure to violence. These data offer a rare occasion to explore these understudied relationships. Our novel analytic strategy will advance the fields of study on community gender norms among men and the multilevel determinants of men's IPV perpetration. Our results will inform national policies and community programs to reduce men's perpetration of IPV in Bangladesh, with implications for research and policy in similar settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop and test a novel measurement model for senior men's community-level gender norms in Bangladesh, and we will use this measure to explore whether living in a community in which senior men favor gender equity and disfavor violence against women lowers the risk that a younger man will perpetrate IPV, either directly and/or by buffering the influence of his prior exposure to violence in childhood. Advancing knowledge of these under-explored relationships will critically inform national policies and community-level social mobilization programs aimed at reducing younger men's perpetration of IPV in Bangladesh, with extended implications for research and policy in similar low-resource settings.              ", A  Multilevel Analysis of Partner Violence,8893696,R03HD081438,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Attitude ', ' Bangladesh ', ' Behavior ', ' Buffers ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Ever Married ', ' Fathers ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Marriage ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Rural Community ', ' base ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Fostering ', ' Gender Relations ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Wife ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Policy Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' violent partner ', ' problem, partner, abuse, violent ', ' partner violence ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' violence against women ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' Population ', ' migration ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' young man ', ' ']",NICHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R03,2015,78747,0.06343799506696803
"Social ecological determinants of young adult risk behavior DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Almost half of the 20 million reported sexually transmitted infections (STIs) each year occur in people aged 15 to 24. STIs increase risk for HIV infection and can lead to serious health complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, epididymitis, and urethritis. Sexual risk behaviors, such as not using condoms and having multiple partners, place young people at risk for STIs, especially females and African Americans, who have higher rates of infection. Decades of research from longitudinal observational and experimental studies have identified numerous factors predictive of sexual risk behaviors, yet meta-analyses of interventions targeting these behaviors show modest effects. Before more potent interventions can be built, a comprehensive model of STI risk is needed, assessing factors at multiple levels of influence (i.e., individual, social, and environmental) and determining for whom each factor is most salient. Modern causal inference approaches provide a unique opportunity to quickly leverage existing resources to address these pressing research questions. For example, propensity score methods efficiently reduce the bias of many third variables that represent alternative causal explanations; thus, it becomes possible to assess factors that otherwise cannot be randomized for ethical or practical reasons. The proposed study will apply propensity score methods to data from the first three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to estimate the causal effects of individual (e.g., perceived benefits of sex), social (e.g., supportive friendships, parental attitues about sex, parent connectedness, school connectedness), and environmental (e.g., access to sexual education curriculum, access or referral to family planning services) factors on sexual risk behaviors in young adulthood. In addition, we will determine whether the pathways leading to STI health disparities vary by gender and race/ethnicity groups and explore how social ecological factors interact with one another. For example, we will examine whether high parental connectedness (social level) mitigates the effect of perceived benefits of sex (individual level) o sexual risk behaviors in young adulthood, and whether having access to sexual education curriculum (environmental level) offsets the effect of not having supportive friendships (social level) on sexual risk behaviors. Behavioral theories are virtually silent about interactions between factors and across levels, yet understanding their presence (or absence) could guide researchers in the construction of more effective and tailored interventions. The results of this study will inform the development of effective STI preventive interventions, thereby reducing the public health burden of STIs among young people. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Despite decades of research to identify and intervene on the social ecological factors for sexual risk behaviors, STI incidence rates remain stubbornly persistent, particularly among young people aged 15 to 24. By leveraging existing resources, we will use innovative causal inference methods to strengthen the understanding of which factors are most strongly associated with sexual risk behaviors that place young people at risk for STIs, how these factors mitigate or exacerbate one other, and for whom the factors are most salient. These findings will enable researchers to develop more potent STI preventive interventions, thereby reducing the public health burden of STIs among young people.",Social ecological determinants of young adult risk behavior,8845576,R03HD079711,"['Accounting ', ' Behavior ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Family Planning ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epididymitis ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' unable to bear children ', ' infertile ', ' Difficulty conceiving ', ' Cannot achieve a pregnancy ', ' Infertility ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Multiple Partners ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Scoring Method ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Students ', ' Urethritis ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Friendships ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' sexually active ', ' Pelvic Inflammatory Disease ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Techniques ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' age group ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' hormonal contraception ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' fourteen year old ', ' age 14 years ', ' 14 year old ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' ']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2015,61425,0.05195366180729515
"Pathways to Sexual Health among Adolescent Orphans across sub-Saharan Africa ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In sub-Saharan Africa, 56 million children have lost a parent. As these orphans reach adolescence, there is mounting concern that they may be experiencing heightened levels of sexual victimization, risky sexual behavior, and STD transmission. The little available research on orphan sexual disparities, however, lacks the technical rigor, geographic scope and consistency needed to draw broad programmatic and policy conclusions. Moreover, there has been almost no investigation of the modifiable pathways by which orphan disparities form or the factors that create resilience. The proposed study will address these gaps through the analysis of 34 existing Demographic and Health Surveys in 22 sub-Saharan Africa countries and has the following specific aims: Aim 1) To test whether orphanhood is a risk factor for adverse sexual outcomes, including sexual violence, high risk sexual behaviors and STD infection. Although orphan disadvantage is often assumed, there is a glaring lack of evidence in support. Our findings will improve scientific knowledge by examining the existence and geographic consistency of disparities. Aim 2) To simultaneously test multiple pathways between orphanhood and the above adverse sexual outcomes. We propose a conceptual framework that will allow us to identify the most salient pathways, and thus guide the development of appropriate prevention programs for orphans. Aim 3) To identify protective factors that moderate the association between orphanhood and the above adverse sexual outcomes. Although most research and policy focuses on orphan disadvantage, many orphans successfully navigate difficult circumstances and engage in sexually healthy behaviors. We will investigate protective individual assets and family resources that moderate risk and that may be strengthened through future intervention. Thus, the proposed study will advance the field by providing rigorous, generalizable evidence on the sexual health of adolescent orphans living in resource- deprived areas. Importantly, there is already substantial commitment from humanitarian groups, governments, and donors to improve the welfare of orphaned adolescents. This represents a critical window of opportunity: strong evidence can be immediately leveraged to generate new programmatic initiatives to improve sexual health among this marginalized population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed project focuses on understanding sexual health disparities in an underserved and highly vulnerable population: orphaned adolescents. We will use large quantitative data to identify whether orphans represent a high risk population that requires targeted investment and programming. By generating a better understanding of underlying pathways and protective assets, we will also be able to highlight factors amenable to intervention.            ",Pathways to Sexual Health among Adolescent Orphans across sub-Saharan Africa,8963786,R03HD082475,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Charge ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Epidemic ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Infection ', ' Investments ', ' Parents ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' UNICEF ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Demographic and Health Surveys ', ' Orphan ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Policies ', ' Glare ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Stream ', ' Country ', ' health knowledge ', ' experience ', ' Prevention program ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Policy Research ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' high risk ', ' sexual violence ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' initiation of sexual activity ', ' sexual debut ', ' ']",NICHD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R03,2015,79000,0.007582530201563916
"Strong Men, Strong Communities: Cultural Tradition to Improve Native Men's Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indian (AI) males experience profound health disparities compared to their counterparts in all other U.S. racial and ethnic groups. For example, AI men have the highest age-adjusted prevalence of type 2 diabetes (~18 percent) among U.S. men, while non-Hispanic White men have the lowest (~7 percent). In recent decades, AIs have seen a disproportionate increase in diabetes-related complications and mortality compared to all other groups, such that age-adjusted diabetes death rates in AI men are now almost twice those in White men. Several large randomized, controlled trials in non-AIs confirm that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed by interventions that promote healthy lifestyles, but little empirical data exist on interventions to prevent diabetes in AI men. In the clinic-based U.S. Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), only 55 out of 3,234 participants were AI men. Similarly, in the diabetes prevention programs in Native communities, participation by AI males is low, ranging from 33 percent to 74 percent. Many explanations have been posited for the low participation rates among men of all races in lifestyle interventions. Recruiting AI men in clinic-based programs is difficult because they tend to seek clinical care less often than women. AI men's perceptions of normative health behaviors and gender roles may also discourage participation, particularly in mixed-gender groups. Therefore, an urgent need exists for diabetes risk reduction programs tailored to the unique values and habits of AI men, with a particular focus on recruitment and retention.  We are collaborating with the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe (Minnesota), the Indian Health Board of Minneapolis (Minnesota), and Yakama Nation and Heritage University Center for Native American Health and Culture (Washington) to develop the Strong Men, Strong Communities (SMSC) program. This is a culturally appropriate approach for AI men that targets modifiable diabetes risk factors. It uses methods adapted from successful, non-clinic based programs for other high-risk minority populations, and it incorporates elements of DPP and SDPI-DP. Our Specific Aims are to:  1) Refine the SMSC intervention with feedback from focus groups in our 3 partner communities.  2) Compare change in diabetes risk score (primary outcome) and modifiable diabetes risk factors (secondary outcomes) in the SMSC intervention and wait-list control groups.  3) Evaluate the ability of SMSC to retain 80 percent of 240 AI male participants, 21-65 years of age with no previous diagnosis of diabetes. The proposed study fills a striking gap in approaches to increase recruitment and participation in lifestyle programs that reduce diabetes risk in AI men. The proposed study will have broad implications for the ongoing epidemic of AI obesity and diabetes. Given the need to increase AI men's participation in lifestyle interventions, our findings might have substantial public health impact on tribal communities across the U.S.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health disparities experienced by American Indian (AI) men compared to AI women and other racial/ethnic groups are striking and the gap is worsening.

"Reproductive health disparities and sexual orientation in girls and women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to their heterosexual peers, sexual minority (i.e., lesbian and bisexual) female youth are particularly vulnerable to having poor health, especially poor reproductive health. Emerging research shows that the health of sexual minorities can be adversely affected by state-level discriminatory laws. This discrimination can occur in states that have failed to enact protections around hate crimes, job discrimination, or same-sex marriage. However, little is known about the association of these types of public policies with reproductive health. Policy environments are also highly variable across U.S. states and dynamic across time, as demonstrated by the U.S. Supreme Court overturning the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013. Therefore, this research is vital for understanding how the rapidly shifting policy environment may affect sexual minorities. Empirical evidence is needed to inform new public policy development and public health strategies to improve reproductive health, but few researchers have the training needed to explore such disparities and translate findings into action.  In the proposed project, Dr. Charlton argues that public policy may be associated with the reproductive health of sexual minority girls and women. She will explore this through the following aims: (1) Identify how public policy may be associated with the reproductive health of sexual minority girls and women; (2) Elucidate what adverse reproductive health outcomes may be associated with public policy among sexual minority girls and women and where these reproductive health outcomes occur; and (3) Examine potential reasons why adverse reproductive health outcomes disproportionately burden sexual minority girls and women. To fulfill these aims, national data will be analyzed from two longitudinal cohorts of adolescents and young adults (Growing Up Today Study I/II) along with a cohort of their mothers (Nurses' Health Study II).  In order complete the proposed research, Dr. Charlton must build on her epidemiology skills with formal training in health-related public policy. As such, her mentors have developed a plan to advance her training in areas such as policy analysis and econometrics. This training will enable her to create a comprehensive database representing the various policy environments in every U.S. state and analyze how this environment is associated with the reproductive health of sexual minority girls and women. The proposed research is in line with the NICHD Office of Health Equity's initiatives and will be among the firs to examine public policy and a range of reproductive health issues among sexual minority girls and women. Dr. Charlton will have access is to uniquely detailed data and her findings will further the understanding of sexual orientation health disparities and promote research in diverse populations. This training and research will give Dr. Charlton a solid foundation in health-related public policy, which, combined with her epidemiology background, will enable her to build a career as an independent research scientist.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will explore the association of discriminatory public policies (e.g., same-sex marriage bans) and the reproductive health of sexual minority girls and women, a population that experiences a disproportionate burden of reproductive disease. The results of this project can help clarify mechanisms of health risk as well as potential interventions for health promotion. In doing so, this project has high potential for publc health impact because it can inform future interventions and the development of health-related public policy strategies.            ",Reproductive health disparities and sexual orientation in girls and women,9079271,F32HD084000,"['adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' Crime ', ' Data Collection ', ' Daughter ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Hate ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Laws ', ' Marriage ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Nurses ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' adolescents who are pregnant ', ' Underage Pregnancy ', ' Teenage Pregnancy ', ' Teen Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Minors ', ' Adolescent Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Adolescence ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Competence ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' career ', ' court ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Solid ', ' Medical ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Policies ', ' Lesbian ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Shapes ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' reproductive ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' girls ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Policy Research ', ' Research Training ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', "" Nurses' Health Study "", ' Heterosexuals ', ' Unplanned pregnancy ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' initiation of intercourse ', ' early sexual initiation ', ' early sex initiation ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' sexual debut ', ' sexual initiation ', ' initiation of sexual activity ', ' sexual minority ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' same-sex marriage ', ' Same-sex ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' ']",NICHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,F32,2016,58794,0.0204600370480087
"The Construction of Power, IPV and HIV risk among Meth-Using Men and Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intimate partner violence (IPV), defined as physical and sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner, poses a significant public health problem in the United States. According to CDC's 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, more than 1 in 3 women and more than 1 in 4 men reported ever having experienced IPV. Research supports a number of risk factors related primarily to female victimization including: socio-demographic variables, sexual-risk behaviors, drug use, past abuse, etc. as well as emerging evidence for risk factors unique to abused males including gender expectations, stigma, and poor social support. Literature on the relationship between drug use and IPV indicates that methamphetamine (meth) use is independently associated with IPV among male, female and couple drug-users. Meth-use has been associated with impaired judgment, poor decision-making ability, and poor sexual relationship power (SRP), all which contribute to increased sexual risk behaviors and consequently, HIV infection. Power is defined as a multidimensional concept that involves a degree of inequity in the distribution of resources and is embodied in one's personal control and ability to influence the behaviors of others. While power is most commonly conceptualized in the form of SRP within IPV research, more recent studies have documented the role of social and structural sources of power in predicting risk of HIV and IPV. The specific aims of the proposed project are to quantitatively: 1) assess the relationship between sexual relationship power (SRP) and IPV among HIV-negative, heterosexual meth-using women and men, and 2) examine gender differences in risk factors (e.g. socio-demographic variables, SRP, condom use, drug use) associated with recent IPV using an existing data set from an HIV behavioral intervention study (FASTLANE2) conducted in 2001-2005. This study also aims to qualitatively: 3) describe the construction of power at the individual, social and structural levels and how this is related to IPV and sexual risk-taking, and 4) describe the relationship between power, IPV and sexual risk-taking behaviors within the context of meth-use. For the qualitative portion of this study we will recruit a sample of 60 heterosexual meth-using men and women (30 men and 30 women) who reside in San Diego County. Participants will be asked to complete one in-depth interview consisting of close and open-ended questions on personal characteristics, drug use, sexual risk behaviors, experience of IPV, power within their relationship, and neighborhood and social support characteristics. This research will add to the current literature by: 1) exploring gender differences in the risk factors related to IPV, 2) describing the construction of power at the individual, social and structural levels and how this impacts HIV risk behaviors and IPV; and 3) describing the relationship between power, IPV and sexual risk-taking within the context of meth-use. The long term goal of this work is to inform the creation of interventions tailored to the specific risk facors of IPV and HIV including poor power and related sexual-risk taking faced by meth-using men and women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Research that supports excess burden of intimate partner violence (IPV) and HIV risk among meth-users illustrates a complex relationship that includes both indirect and direct pathways that independently connect meth-use, IPV, and HIV risk. Despite support for this relationship, the majority of the existing research is limited in that it:1) focuses primarily on female victimization, neglecting to approach the topics of male victimization, 2) focuses on individual and interpersonal factors, without taking into account how social and structural factors play a role in IPV and associated HIV risk, and 3) does not thoroughly examine the role of meth-use in IPV and HIV risk. Given research that support meth-users as high-risk individuals for both IPV and HIV risk, this research will provide valuable insight into an extremely vulnerable and understudied population to ultimately inform the development of more culturally sensitive and relevant interventions that target IPV, power and HIV risk among meth-using men and women.","The Construction of Power, IPV and HIV risk among Meth-Using Men and Women",9001328,R36DA039012,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Gender Role ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Judgment ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Literature ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' N-Methylamphetamine ', ' Methylamphetamine ', ' Desoxyephedrine ', ' Deoxyephedrine ', ' Crystal Meth ', ' Methamphetamine ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Play ', ' Power Supplies ', ' Power Sources ', ' Public Health ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Area ', ' racism ', ' Sexism ', ' Gender Bias ', ' Sex Bias ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Drug user ', ' Nature ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Complex ', ' experience ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Sexual Health ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Exclusion Criteria ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' sexual relationship ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' neglect ', ' Interpersonal Violence ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' high risk ', ' sexual violence ', ' sexual risk taking ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' methamphetamine use ', ' methamphetamine using ', ' METH using ', ' METH use ', ' violence victimization ', ' methamphetamine user ', ' meth user ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R36,2016,11550,0.04034836353614303
"Parenting and Men's Health: The Utility of the Fathers and Sons Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the public health significance of problems such as substance abuse and depression among African American men, few evidence-based prevention strategies have been developed for these men and even fewer have focused on a strategy that uses their role as a father as a protection against poor health outcomes. This application proposes to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the Fathers and Sons Program for reducing depression and drinking behavior and increasing substance use and mental health service utilization among nonresident African American fathers. It focuses on enhancing fathers' parenting knowledge, attitudes and behaviors, connectedness with their sons, and awareness and use of community resources. This theoretically-based, gender-specific, culturally relevant, family-centered program was originally designed to enhance parenting attitudes and behaviors among nonresident African American fathers and strengthen their relationship with their preadolescent sons as a way to prevent youth risky behaviors. It was developed using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to increase its relevance and appeal to the intended audiences. Preliminary evidence suggests the program is promising for improving health behaviors and well-being among fathers as well. Our goal is to conduct a randomized control trial to evaluate the program for its long-term health benefits for both fathers and sons. The results of the original Fathers and Sons intervention program will be compared to a control group that will receive a family-based program focused on physical activity and nutrition. Because fathers and sons participate in the Fathers and Sons programs together, we will have the added benefit of examining how influencing father's parenting attitudes and behaviors affect their sons' health behaviors, offering intergenerational perspectives on men's health.

"Community Mobilization to Improve the HIV/AIDS Continuum of Care Among Black Men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV rates are at catastrophic levels among young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). A study in 21 US cities found that 21% of YBMSM aged 18-29 were HIV+, compared to 9% of Latino and 7% of white young MSM (YMSM), and these disparities are worsening. YBMSM are more likely to be HIV-infected, less likely to be aware of their HIV-infection, and less likely to disclose that they are HIV-infected, relative to men of other ethnic/racial groups. HIV+ YBMSM are also less likely than white MSM to be in treatment for HIV and to have undetectable viral loads (VLs). When HIV+ individuals achieve an undetectable VL, their own health improves, and they are also less infectious to others. Getting to that point, however, requires that HIV+ individuals: (1) know their HIV status; (2) link to HIV care; (3) stay in care over time; (4) begin appropriate treatment; and (5) adhere to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We refer to these steps as engagement in the HIV Care Continuum (CC). While these approaches have great potential to reduce HIV incidence, it is estimated that only 25% of HIV+ people in the US have engaged in the CC to the point of having undetectable VLs. Research suggests that HIV+ YBMSM engage in the CC far less than others. A community-level intervention (CLI) to build and mobilize communities of YBMSM to support HIV+ men to engage in the CC, decrease psychosocial barriers and increase psychosocial facilitators to engage in the CC within those communities may be an efficacious approach to prevent HIV transmission and improve health outcomes for YBMSM. This proposal will test the efficacy of such a CLI model, called United Black Element+ (UBE+). UBE+ will be an adaptation of a current CLI, called UBE. UBE has already engaged hundreds of YBMSM in Dallas TX, and it diffuses support for HIV prevention and creates positive social norms around reducing rates of unprotected sex and increasing regular HIV testing by building an empowered, mobilized YBMSM community. UBE+ will be an adaptation and extension of UBE designed to increase YBMSM's engagement in the CC. The aims of this project are: (1) To adapt and expand UBE into UBE+, a multilevel intervention that includes a new focus on increasing engagement in the CC among HIV+YBMSM, including targeting psychosocial barriers and facilitators to engaging in the CC that are experienced in this community (e.g., HIV stigma and social support); (2) To implement UBE+ in Dallas for 3 years in collaboration with a local AIDS Service Organization currently implementing UBE, the Dallas County Health Department, and the Texas Department of State Health Services' (TDSHS) HIV-STD Program; and (3) To evaluate the efficacy of UBE+ in increasing engagement in the CC in Dallas (utilizing Houston as a control community) using 2 independent methods: (a) a longitudinal cohort of HIV+ YBMSM providing data on engagement in care, and experiences of psychosocial and logistic barriers and facilitators to engagement in care; and (b) public health data that the TDSHS independently collects on HIV+ YBMSM's engagement in the CC. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) are contracting HIV at alarmingly high rates that far exceed other ethnic/racial groups. These disparities are not due to increased risk behavior among YBMSM, but seem to result because YBMSM who are sexually active are more likely to encounter infectious partners. YBMSM are more likely to be HIV+, and less likely to be on treatment for HIV, and to have undetectable HIV viral loads (VLs). When HIV+ men achieve an undetectable VL, their own health improves, and they are also less infectious to others. Getting to that point requires that HIV+ individuals go through a number of steps of engaging in the continuum of care (CC), such as obtaining health care for HIV, and taking medications as prescribed.

"Cancer-Health Disparities in Incarcerated Men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this NCI K22 career development proposal is to develop the PI, a PhD, and trained social worker in health disparities, into a successfully funded independent cancer researcher. The proposal contains both career development and structured research plan activities focus on advancing cancer-health disparities research with incarcerated men. Incarcerated men have not generally been the focus of cancer health studies although multiple reports indicate that approximately 60-80% of inmates in the United States have histories of tobacco use, compared to 30% of the general population, and over 80% of individuals involved in the criminal justice system report histories of substance use, including alcohol, marijuana and crack cocaine. This is an alarming statistic, considering that tobacco, marijuana, crack cocaine, and alcohol use are associated with an increased risk of developing lung and liver diseases and certain cancers. Little is known about incarcerated men's cancer-health disparities and how incarceration affects their health behaviors upon release to the community. This program builds upon the PI's prior work including her strong background in HIV/AIDS research, clinical practice, and mixed-methods research experience. The specific career goals are: (1) to become proficient in research skills, focusing on advanced quantitative methods, data analysis and grant writing (enroll in cancer epidemiology and longitudinal research courses); and (2) to gain experience in prison cancer-health disparities research (collecting primary cancer- health disparities data across three different correctional facilities). The proposed research will assess the cancer-health disparities and smoking behaviors of men ages 18 years and over who are currently incarcerated in facilities of three different security levels (i.e., detention, minimum, and medium). The specific aims are to: (1) assess the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about cancer and describe the smoking behaviors of incarcerated men; and (2) adapt the Cancer 101 (a cancer education resource to improve cancer knowledge, survival rates and cancer control in vulnerable populations) for incarcerated men in three different correctional settings. The results from the K22 described in this proposal are intended to inform the basis of a NCI R01 grant application. The long-term goal is to design and implement a culturally appropriate prison-to-community cancer-health prevention trial for incarcerated men returning to their communities in order to ultimately reduce the cancer burden affecting men with criminal justice backgrounds. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer-related disparities are not well understood as they apply to incarcerated populations. The proposed award explores cancer health and cancer education in men who are incarcerated.

"Pathways to Sexual Health among Adolescent Orphans across sub-Saharan Africa ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In sub-Saharan Africa, 56 million children have lost a parent. As these orphans reach adolescence, there is mounting concern that they may be experiencing heightened levels of sexual victimization, risky sexual behavior, and STD transmission. The little available research on orphan sexual disparities, however, lacks the technical rigor, geographic scope and consistency needed to draw broad programmatic and policy conclusions. Moreover, there has been almost no investigation of the modifiable pathways by which orphan disparities form or the factors that create resilience. The proposed study will address these gaps through the analysis of 34 existing Demographic and Health Surveys in 22 sub-Saharan Africa countries and has the following specific aims: Aim 1) To test whether orphanhood is a risk factor for adverse sexual outcomes, including sexual violence, high risk sexual behaviors and STD infection. Although orphan disadvantage is often assumed, there is a glaring lack of evidence in support. Our findings will improve scientific knowledge by examining the existence and geographic consistency of disparities. Aim 2) To simultaneously test multiple pathways between orphanhood and the above adverse sexual outcomes. We propose a conceptual framework that will allow us to identify the most salient pathways, and thus guide the development of appropriate prevention programs for orphans. Aim 3) To identify protective factors that moderate the association between orphanhood and the above adverse sexual outcomes. Although most research and policy focuses on orphan disadvantage, many orphans successfully navigate difficult circumstances and engage in sexually healthy behaviors. We will investigate protective individual assets and family resources that moderate risk and that may be strengthened through future intervention. Thus, the proposed study will advance the field by providing rigorous, generalizable evidence on the sexual health of adolescent orphans living in resource- deprived areas. Importantly, there is already substantial commitment from humanitarian groups, governments, and donors to improve the welfare of orphaned adolescents. This represents a critical window of opportunity: strong evidence can be immediately leveraged to generate new programmatic initiatives to improve sexual health among this marginalized population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed project focuses on understanding sexual health disparities in an underserved and highly vulnerable population: orphaned adolescents. We will use large quantitative data to identify whether orphans represent a high risk population that requires targeted investment and programming. By generating a better understanding of underlying pathways and protective assets, we will also be able to highlight factors amenable to intervention.",Pathways to Sexual Health among Adolescent Orphans across sub-Saharan Africa,9121608,R03HD082475,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Charge ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Epidemic ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Infection ', ' Investments ', ' Parents ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' UNICEF ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Demographic and Health Surveys ', ' Orphan ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Policies ', ' Glare ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Stream ', ' Country ', ' health knowledge ', ' experience ', ' Prevention program ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Policy Research ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' high risk ', ' sexual violence ', ' effective intervention ', ' sexual debut ', ' sexual initiation ', ' initiation of sexual activity ', ' sexual victimization ', ' adolescent sexual health ', ' juvenile sexual health ', ' orphaned adolescents ', ' ']",NICHD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R03,2016,78210,0.007582530201563916
"Revealing women's hidden role as critical components of HIV transmission networks in Rakai, Uganda: an interdisciplinary approach ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The burden of HIV is ~60% higher in women than men in sub-Saharan Africa, and this gender inequity is a key challenge to HIV control. Identifying women at greatest risk for HIV and their infecting male partners is critical for effective, targeted control of the African HIV epidemic. It is also vital to identify those HIV-infected women most likely to contribute to ongoing viral spread. However, African women vastly underreport sexual contacts and high risk occupations such as sex work in interview-based surveys and clinical settings making their identification challenging. Here, we propose to use phylogenetic, epidemiological, and qualitative methods to study network drivers of female risk of HIV acquisition and onward transmission to men in the rural Rakai District, Uganda. We will use existing data from the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS), a population- based study of HIV incidence and behaviors in 50 communities (n~17,000). In Aim 1 we will identify HIV- infected women who have central roles in transmission networks using viral phylogenetics and then characterize them with RCCS epidemiological data. We will also conduct in-depth interviews with these women to gain deeper insight into their HIV-related risks and to understand the barriers to reporting these risks. In Aim 2 we will use viral phylogenetics in conjunction with probabilistic statistical models to identify the pool of infecting male partners tat sustain the excess HIV burden among Rakai women. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will use microsimulation models to estimate the potential effectiveness of various combination HIV prevention strategies targeted to high risk subgroups to reduce HIV incidence. The proposed research is part of a K01 award and will provide the applicant with the advanced training in HIV modelling, behavioral science, and phylogenetics necessary to transition to an independent investigator with expertise in the application of interdisciplinary methods to HIV epidemiology and prevention. Results will improve female HIV risk assessment and identify candidate targeted strategies to prevent HIV in African women. It also will provide critical formative data fr a future R01 to implement and empirically assess the effectiveness of targeted interventions to high risk women and their partners in Rakai.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The success of interventions to reduce female HIV risk depends upon an understanding of the drivers of excess HIV infection in women. This project studies network drivers of female HIV risk and onward transmission to men in rural Uganda using interdisciplinary methods. We also explore barriers to HIV risk assessment in a setting where women vastly underreport sex work and risky sexual partnerships. This study will inform targeted PEPFAR initiatives to prevent HIV in high risk African women such as DREAMS.        ","Revealing women's hidden role as critical components of HIV transmission networks in Rakai, Uganda: an interdisciplinary approach",9140326,K01AI125086,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Female ', ' Fishes ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Phylogeny ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Uganda ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' African ', ' Rural ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' Viral ', ' success ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Abate ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Gifts ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Length ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' demographics ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' primary outcome ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' ']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,127561,0.03370268202158088
"Young Men of Color Who Have Sex with Men Cohort Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  U01 - Cohort Study with Young Men of Color who have Sex with Men In this fourth decade of the HIV epidemic, we continue to see 50,000 new infections annually in the U.S., particularly among Black/African American and Latino young men who have sex with men (YMSM of color), who now account for 60% of new infections among Black/African American MSM and 45% of new infections among Latino MSM. Black/African American YMSM remain five times more likely to be HIV seropositive, seven times more likely to have an undiagnosed HIV infection, and 45% more likely to be diagnosed with an STI than other YMSM. YMSM of color are also the least likely to seek and remain in HIV/AIDS care, and when they do seek care, they typically already have advanced HIV disease. Among youth who initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART), 54% will achieve viral suppression; unfortunately 57% will not be retained in care and less than 6% will remain virally suppressed. Changing the course of this epidemic is going to require a dramatically different approach to prevention. We are therefore proposing to conduct longitudinal research with a large and diverse cohort of 450 YMSM of color in order to prevent new HIV infections, reduce transmission, and reduce HIV/AIDS-related disparities by focusing on successful engagement in care. Building on the HIV Continuum of Care and Prevention paradigm (i.e., seek, test, treat, and retain in care) and the Syndemic Theory of Risk, we will use a mixed-methods study design to collect and analytically triangulate quantitative, qualitative, and biological measures at baseline and every six months. Participants will be recruited from public venues, HIV test sites, and HIV/AIDS clinics using randomized probability and purposeful sampling designs. All participants will be tracked to ensure a retention rate of 90% or better, which is a feasible target given our retention rates of 94% in the Healthy Young Men's (HYM) Study. The specific aims are to 1) better understand and operationally define what linkage, engagement, retention to care (both primary health and HIV/AIDS treatment) and adherence means to HIV- and HIV+ YMSM of color; 2) characterize and monitor over time YMSM of color's use of alcohol and illicit drugs; utilization of HIV testing and prevention services; incidence of HIV and STIs; insurance status and access to health care services, including primary care and HIV/AIDS treatment services; engagement in and utilization of health care and HIV/AIDS treatment services; retention in HIV/AIDS care and adherence to ART; and utilization of biomedical interventions, such as PrEP and PEP; and 3) identify barriers/facilitator of engagement along the HIV Continuum of Care and Prevention. The proposed research builds on close to two decades of NIH-funded research by our team focused on this and other high-risk youth populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is an urgent need to address increasing rates of HIV/AIDS among high-risk Black, Latino and multiracial young men who have sex with men in Los Angeles. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to develop new interventions designed to reduce HIV/STI risk and transmission, reduce HIV/AIDS disease progression, and improve the health and quality of life of HIV+ young men. This research will also inform the development of new HIV service delivery models given that the U.S. is now reevaluating all models of care under the auspices of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and

"Juvenile Court Approaches to Reduce Reproductive Health Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial and ethnic minority youth are disproportionately represented in the juvenile justice (JJ) system, just as they are overrepresented among those living in poverty, those growing up in disorganized neighborhood environments and those with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unwanted pregnancies. Multiple societal and structural factors are associated with poorer sexual health outcomes for these youth, including limited access to, and availability of, health care services and their socia (and sexual transmission) networks. JJ youth are likely to accrue further legal charges and be incarcerated into adulthood, thereby perpetuating racial and ethnic health disparities within the adult criminal justice system. Despite that racial and ethnic disparities exist in both health and legal systems, the relationship between juvenile justice involvement and health (including sexual) disparities is highly understudied. Constitutional mandates require access to medical testing and treatment in correctional settings, including free access to sexual health care services; however, confined juveniles only represent approximately twenty percent of arrested youth and the current trend in juvenile justice is away from confinement. Waiting until youth are confined to provide increased access to sexual health services misses a tremendous opportunity to improve sexual health outcomes and reduce disparities for a broader group of juveniles. The objective of this study is therefore to provide data that will inform public health and juvenile justice structural intervention development and policy geared toward increasing access to and uptake of sexual health prevention, treatment, care and support services for court- involved, non-incarcerated (CINI) youth. We seek to collect qualitative and quantitative data from juvenile court and department of health key informants that will provide novel documentation of the barriers to and facilitators of increasing access to and uptake of sexual health services for CINI juveniles. A combination of qualitative semistructured interviews and a large-scale survey of a diverse US sample of court and department of health settings (N=300 respondents) will provide data on system attitudes, perceptions, practices and policies that limit or enable access to sexual health services for CINI juveniles. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Juvenile justice youth are at risk for poorer sexual health outcomes such as HIV, other sexually transmitted infections and unintended teenage pregnancies. Racial and ethnic disparities in sexual health outcomes and criminal justice involvement appear inextricably intertwined and yet little attention has been paid to how juvenile justice and public health systems could most successfully partner to reduce juvenile sexual health disparities. This study will provide data from a diverse US sample of court and department of health settings to understand system-level attitudes, perceptions, practices and policies that limit or enable access to sexual health services for court-involved, non-incarcerated (CINI) juveniles. Data will inform structural intervention development and policy geared toward increasing access to and uptake of sexual health prevention, treatment, care and support services for CINI

"Intimate Partner Violence in Sexual Minority Female Adolescents and Young Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young female sexual minorities (YFSM) are at exceptionally high risk for intimate partner violence (IPV), with over half of YFSM reporting physical or sexual abuse by a dating partner. These young IPV victims may be particularly vulnerable to the negative physical and mental health consequences of IPV, including substance abuse, depression, and suicide, due to minority stress and diminished protective resources (e.g., parent support, community connectedness). In addition, YFSM may be less likely to report and to seek or receive help for IPV because they are not ""out"" about their sexual orientation or they fear stigmatization and discrimination. Women who seek help for same-sex IPV are often denied services (e.g., two-thirds of LGBT IPV survivors were denied access to domestic violence shelters) and feel marginalized and unsupported by domestic violence service systems. Basic research is clearly needed to inform development of culturally sensitive, evidence-based interventions to prevent IPV in YFSM and to support female sexual minority IPV victims. The existing literature, however, has almost exclusively focused on IPV in heterosexuals. Because LGBT teens and young adults face unique issues surrounding their relationships and sexual behaviors (e.g., pressures to deny or conceal sexual identity and activities), the risk and protective factors for IPV, help-seeking behaviors, and consequences of IPV in sexual minority youth are likely quite different from those observed in heterosexual youth. The overarching goal of this project is to begin to address these disparities by conducting an innovative study of IPV in female sexual minority adolescents and young adults (YFSM). We propose a novel, minority stress-informed dynamic developmental systems perspective of IPV in YFSM, which we will test using a mixed-methods, accelerated longitudinal design. Building upon the longest running study of LGBT youth, we will collect quantitative data from two ethnically diverse cohorts of YFSM (N= 530; ages 16-26) every six months for two years, as well as qualitative data from 50 selected participants. We will accomplish the overarching goal with four primary specific aims: (1) Describe the nature and trajectories of IPV in YFSM across adolescence and young adulthood; (2) Identify risk and protective factors for IPV among YFSM, including factors that differentiate violent vs. non-violent/healthy relationships; (3) Examine factors that affect YFSM's reporting of IPV, help-seeking for IPV, and ability to benefit from help provided (e.g., cultural competence of providers); and (4) Evaluate the consequences of IPV in YFSM, identifying factors that raise risk for or protect YFSM victims from revictimization and negative health consequences of IPV. Integration of the resulting quantitative and qualitative data will be used to inform the development of evidence-based interventions to prevent IPV among YFSM and better serve those who experience IPV. 1            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young female sexual minorities experience exceptionally high rates of Intimate partner violence (IPV) and may be particularly vulnerable to subsequent physical and mental health problems. The aims of this study are to describe IPV in female sexual minorities across adolescence and young adulthood, as well as to identify factors that raise risk for or protect against IPV, affect IPV victims' ability to receive appropriate help, and exacerbate or mitigate the negative health consequences of IPV. Data obtained from this project will inform the development of culturally sensitive interventions to reduce the rates of IPV and to better support IPV victims in this vulnerable population.        ",Intimate Partner Violence in Sexual Minority Female Adolescents and Young Adults,9123402,R01HD086170,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Buffers ', ' Communities ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' pressure ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Shelter facility ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' Injury ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Area ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Domestic Violence ', ' Survivors ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' sexually abused ', ' sex abuse ', ' Sexual abuse ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' cultural competence ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' Reporting ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' physical abuse ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' data modeling ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 21 year old ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' revictimization ', ' longitudinal design ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobia  ', ' Homophobic ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' same-sex couple ', ' same sex relationship ', ' same sex partner ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Same-sex ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' violence victimization ', ' prospective test ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,R01,2016,584191,0.01631227568850796

"Mobile Phone Intervention for Physical Activity Maintenance in African American Men (MobileMen) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  African American men experience health disparities across a number of preventable chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, strokes, obesity, and diabetes. Physical activity (PA) is a modifiable risk factor for these conditions. The few PA promotion studies that have included African American men have resulted in successful short-term behavior change, yet in order for the health benefits of PA to be realized, PA levels must be maintained. While behavior change maintenance programs have been shown to assist participants in sustaining behavior change, we were unable to identify any studies that have developed maintenance programs specifically targeting African American men. The purpose of this proposal is to develop a PA maintenance program for African American men. This Phase I STTR project, MobileMen, will deliver the intervention utilizing mHealth technology and therefore, will be led by researchers and multimedia developers at Klein Buendel, Inc. (KB) and Pennington Biomedical Research Center (Dr. Newton, PI). The use of mHealth, as opposed to other avenues of intervention delivery, is based on published reports documenting that African Americans perceive mobile technology as an acceptable means of intervention delivery. In addition, ownership of smartphones and the use of text messaging are highest among African Americans compared to other ethnic groups. There is a need to tailor this intervention towards African American men because they have unique gender role beliefs which influence exercise promotion. There is also increasing recognition of the need for researchers to develop interventions in collaboration with the target population. Therefore, the current proposal will involve conducting formative research with African American men to identify the key elements for program development. The fact that mHealth is acceptable to- and the fact that the application will be developed in collaboration with African American men, leads us to hypothesize that African American men will view the mHealth intervention as acceptable, feasible, and usable. In this Phase I STTR, we will: (1) conduct multi-method formative research to guide app design and content, (2) produce a functioning app prototype, and (3) conduct usability testing on the prototype for functionality, ease of use, and interest among African American men. To our knowledge, no study has utilized mobile phones as a means of effecting PA levels in African American men. MobileMen will address an unmet need in the marketplace as it will be the first smartphone app that is targeted toward PA maintenance in African American men.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    African American men are at risk of developing chronic disease partly due to low levels of regular physical activity. Studies have been effective in increasing physical activity levels in African American men; however for the health benefits of exercise to be maintained continued physical activity is necessary. The purpose of the current study is to develop a mobile phone application for African American men that will help them maintain their physical activity levels.            ",Mobile Phone Intervention for Physical Activity Maintenance in African American Men (MobileMen),9114846,R41MD010304,"['Belief ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Elements ', ' Esthetics ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Gender Role ', ' Health ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Manuals ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Ownership ', ' Perception ', ' Program Development ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Health Benefit ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Collaborations ', ' Multimedium ', ' Multimedia ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Document Type ', ' Report (document) ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' STTR ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' Text ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' minority health ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' modifiable risk ', ' user-friendly ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' exercise training ', ' ']",NIMHD,"KLEIN BUENDEL, INC.",R41,2016,210298,0.05036810737449148
"Developing a Text Message Enhanced Physical Activity Intervention for Latino Men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mexican American (MA) men report particularly low rates of physical activity (PA) and are disproportionately burdened by conditions related to sedentary lifestyle (e.g., diabetes, obesity). Due to cultural, SES, educational, and language differences, MA men may have limited access to public health interventions promoting PA. To address these rising health disparities, effective interventions that leverage state-of-the-art technology, theory, and methods are needed for MA men. Our research team has 25 years of experience developing and implementing individually tailored PA interventions. We culturally and linguistically tailored our print intervention for Latina women and then demonstrated its efficacy in two RCTs. This research experience leaves us well poised to address the PA-related health disparities in MA men. Due to the dearth of studies in this area, we conducted qualitative interviews with Spanish speaking MA men (N=10). Their feedback informed the modifications of our PA intervention as well as the creation of new materials, which were then tested in a demonstration trial with MA men (N=10). After 12 weeks, participants reported significant increases in weekly PA (Mean increase=124 minutes, sd=154.86, p =.03) with 100% retention. However, only 40% met the PA guidelines of 150 minutes/week and 30% did not adopt any activity, suggesting a more intensive intervention may be necessary. Follow-up interviews revealed that the men liked the print materials but also wanted greater accountability, more contact with staff and each other, shorter and more frequent tips, and more updates on activity opportunities. The men recommended adding a text message component to address these issues. Thus, the aim of this study is to build upon our tailored print intervention by developing new text-delivered intervention materials to complement our print-based intervention, which will now include printed tailored environmental reports. In Phase 1 we will conduct 6 focus groups with MA men to determine content, frequency, and types of text messages desired, and to identify cultural themes to incorporate into existing and new materials. Themes from the focus groups and sample text messages will be presented to a confirmatory panel. Phase 2 will be a 6-month pilot RCT with MA men (N=60) to test the text- enhanced, Spanish language, individually tailored PA intervention vs. publicly available, Spanish language health education materials, including information on PA, diet, and stress management. This will be followed by post-intervention qualitative interviews to solicit suggestions for improvements to help further refine the program. The proposed pilot will support a future R01 to establish the efficacy of this multi-media, multi-level PA intervention for MA men. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mexican American men report high rates of inactivity and related health conditions. The proposed study seeks to promote physical activity among this at-risk, understudied population by developing interactive and tailored text-messages to enhance a print-based physical activity intervention for Spanish- speaking MA men. The proposed high reach, low cost strategy for increasing physical activity has great potential for adoption on a larger scale and thereby positively impacting public health and eliminating health disparities.",Developing a Text Message Enhanced Physical Activity Intervention for Latino Men,8996205,R21NR014911,"['Adoption ', ' Communication ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Gender Role ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Motivation ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Printing ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Suggestion ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Accountability ', ' Latino ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' sedentary ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Physical activity ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' programs ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Adopted ', ' Frequencies ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Test Result ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' innovative technologies ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Update ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' effective intervention ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' public health intervention ', ' built environment ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2016,193750,0.04414956467930744
"Creating a Tailored Lifestyle Intervention for Midlife Mexican American Men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Midlife (45-64 yr) Mexican-American (MA) men are susceptible to future burden from cardio metabolic diseases because of numerous factors, most notably less healthful dietary and physical activity (PA) behaviors coupled with low participation in chronic disease prevention and management efforts. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand how to promote health-enhancing diet and PA behaviors in this understudied group of the population. The objective of this application is to use a mixed-methods approach to inform the development of and pilot test a gendered- and culturally-tailored diet- and PA intervention for cardiometabolic disease prevention among midlife MA men. This objective will be attained by addressing the following specific aims: (1) conduct qualitative research with midlife MA men and their significant others (e.g. spouse, partner, close family member), and key informants (stakeholders from the MA community) to identify: (a) knowledge, perceptions, and behaviors regarding what constitutes healthful diet and PA practices; (b) perceived barriers and enablers of dietary and PA behavior change, (c) proposed strategies to promote dietary and PA behavior change, (d) perceived resources and assets for implementing dietary and PA behavior change interventions, and (e) masculine, cultural, and social identities that interact to influence interet and engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors; and (2) assess the initial efficacy, feasibility and acceptability of a gender-tailored and culturally-relevant diet and PA behavior change pilot intervention targeting midlife MA men. Phase I of the project will entail focus groups to identify determinants of midlife MA men's health behaviors, existing good practices and health- promoting values and behaviors, and acceptable intervention strategies. The proposed project will use intersectionality, which examines how the blending of identities and experiences create more accurate reflection of the determinants of men's health behaviors, within the context of the sociocultural determinants of health, as the conceptual framework. A ""grassroots"" approach will also explore beliefs, barriers and enablers to dietary and PA change identified by significant others and community stakeholders Information collected during Phase I will inform the development of intervention materials and processes that will be pilot-tested during Phase II. Phase II will consist of a randomized controlled trial to test the initial efficacy, feasibility an acceptability of a gender-tailored, culturally relevant dietary and PA intervention targeting midlie MA men. Innovation lies in our study being the first to apply an intersectional approach in health disparities research with midlife MA men, a severely understudied and high-risk subgroup. To date, no interventions have been developed or adequately tailored to address issues unique to MA men 45-64 yr. Thus, the proposed research is significant be- cause it addresses a critical gap and will inform the development of lifestyle-based interventions targeting mid- life MA men. The proposed project will also establish the foundation for a subsequent test of intervention efficacy, as well as future translation and dissemination in varied community settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will use a mixed-methods approach to develop and pilot-test a gender-tailored and culturally- relevant diet and physical activity intervention targeting midlife Mexican-American men.

"Self-Management of Diabetes in Black Men: The Men are Now United Program (MANUP) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant racial disparities between non-Hispanic Blacks and Whites exist in the prevalence of diabetes and the story of John Henry, the ""steel-drivin'"" man is well known to most Black men in the U.S.; and to most, John Henry is a hero because of his relentless determination. John Henryism is defined as a survival strategy developed among newly freed Black people, one that endorsed the values of hard work, self-reliance, and high effort coping ─ all attributes of successful chronic disease self-management. The goal of this research is to develop a culturally-grounded diabetes self-management intervention for adult Black men. Black men are identified as a priority group in need of targeted diabetes self-management interventions. T T with type 2 diabetes that utilizes social support and mobile technology to improve patient-centered outcomes. The primary outcome will be a 0.5% reduction in A1C levels following the intervention. Secondary outcomes will include reductions in diabetes complication risk factors of blood pressure, waist circumference, and cholesterol. Additional outcomes include medication adherence, blood glucose monitoring, and physical activity. The 10-week intervention is comprised of three components: (1) ten group-based social support meetings that will include the formation of two-man partnerships (""buddies""); (2) a remote-sensing health behavioral technology, the cloud-based Telcare glucometer to facilitate objective monitoring of health behavior; (3) development of gender-sensitive, culturally grounded text messages designed to motivate and remind participants to engage in recommended self- management behaviors. Year one is devoted to designing the group intervention and developing and testing the set of targeted text messages by drawing upon self-determination theory, the diabetes empowerment approach, and research on John Henryism. Given its broad recognition and endorsement among Black men, the story of John Henry and research on John Henryism holds tremendous promise as a conceptual foundation for engaging Black men in a health promotion program. Year two will test the 10-week intervention using a wait-listed control (the men will serve as their own control), repeated measures single arm design (three points in time) with 40 Black men. The study also includes a three-month post-intervention follow-up assessment. Pragmatically, we have chosen to focus on behavior that can be influenced by one-to-one partnerships and small groups. As this targeted research program develops, we will incorporate the influence of family systems and neighborhood contexts within which Black men operate. In summary, Black men with type 2 diabetes can benefit from applying the principles of self-determination, diabetes empowerment, and John Henryism to their own health challenges. The proposed research will develop a gender targeted self-management intervention to assist adult Black men in controlling diabetes through social support and mobile health technology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health relevance of this project is evident in four important issues. First, U.S. ethnic minorities suffer higher rates of diabetes than non-Hispanic Whites. Second, these disparities are evident at every level of socioeconomic status. Third, diabetes is a disease that is modifiable through behaviors that can be controlled directly by the patient. Fourth, many black men need support to control their diabetes. Any intervention that successfully increases preventive behavior will improve overall health and potentially reduce racial disparities.                ",Self-Management of Diabetes in Black Men: The Men are Now United Program (MANUP),8994452,R21NR015589,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cholesterol ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Group Meetings ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Experience ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Self Determination ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Support Groups ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Steel ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Self Management ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' Stimulus ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' syndrome x ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' waist circumference ', ' meetings ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' self reliance ', ' participatory sensing ', ' remote sensing ', ' Participant ', ' empowerment ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' behavioral health ', ' theories ', ' glucose meter ', ' glucometer ', ' glucose monitor ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' post intervention ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' diabetic management ', ' diabetes management ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' family influence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' diabetes control ', ' arm ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' cloud based ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' ']",NINR,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,214808,0.058764178793251534
"Methods for Estimating Sex Differences in Safety and Effectiveness of Drugs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Recent evidence suggests women, in comparison to men, experience greater CVD related mortality, may have inferior responses to treatment, and are at greater risk of adverse drug events. However, from drug development to safety, tolerability and efficacy testing, insufficient attention has been given to sex differencesin patient responses to pharmacologic agents. Moreover, randomized controlled trials, even large multicenter studies, are generally underpowered to detect heterogeneity in efficacy or safety, including any existing sex differences. Our preliminary results further suggest that standard analytic approaches for assessing sex differences in non-experimental research may lead to estimated sex-specific treatment effects that are biased. Therefore, our overall objectives are to develop, test, implement, and disseminate reliable and innovative methods for evaluating sex differences in the comparative effectiveness and safety of CVD pharmacotherapy. Our specific aims are to: 1) identify conditions under which common analytic methods are likely to produce biased estimates of treatment effects in men and/or women; 2) develop innovative alternative analytic methods that validly and reliably evaluate sex differences; 3) test the performance of these innovative methods and the standard analytic approaches in a large scale Monte Carlo simulation study; and 4) apply and validate methods for quantifying sex differences in the safety and effectiveness of pharmacotherapy. We will use national administrative claims data supplemented by survey and laboratory data enabling us to deliver timely answers to these urgent clinical questions with immediate implications for clinical practice. Moreover, the innovative and novel analytic methods we will develop and implement in this proposal will be applicable broadly to the study of other important patient subgroups (such as those defined by race, ethnicity and age), and will be equally relevant across the full spectrum of health conditions and their clinical management. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The findings will impact health and health care by informing risks, benefits, and sex differences in the effects of lipid lowering drugs - currently used by nearly 20 million Americans. By using national administrative claims databases supplemented by rich laboratory and survey data, we leverage our existing resources and deliver timely answers to urgent clinical questions with immediate implications at the bedside. The innovative methods we will develop have application to other subgroups (e.g., minorities, children), and will be equally relevant across the spectrum of clinical concerns from infectious agents to medical devices. In the emerging era of personalized medicine, it is essential that our analytic methods are honed and chosen carefully for the important challenges that face researchers and the stakeholders who rely on their findings.",Methods for Estimating Sex Differences in Safety and Effectiveness of Drugs,9053515,R01HL118255,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Attention ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lipids ', ' Medical Device ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' infectious organism ', ' Infectious Agent ', ' Inferior ', ' American ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' experience ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' drug development ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' therapeutic outcome ', ' therapy outcome ', ' sex ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' treatment effect ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' efficacy testing ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' Adverse drug event ', ' minority children ', ' sex disparity ', ' disparities in sex ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,359174,-0.024701924825663794
"iMAN: Integrated Molecular & Affiliation Network Analysis of HIV Transmission ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a study, ""iMAN: integrated Molecular & Affiliation Network Analysis of HIV Transmission,"" which integrates molecular phylogenetic analysis with systems science methodologies to advance our understanding of the venue-based affiliation networks whereby the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is transmitted. iMAN will examine the highest HIV-risk group, young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) aged 16 to 29 in Houston, TX, and Chicago, IL, based on the cohorts of an ongoing multi-site longitudinal affiliation network project (YMAP: Young Men's Affiliation Project). iMAN aims to further advance the utility of affiliation network analysis by introducing a novel way of addressin fundamental questions about human health behavior, grounded in biological validation, to alleviate racial/ethnic health disparities in HIV-infection rates in regard to YBMSM. YBMSM socialize in a variety of contexts, both real and virtual, and these venues can involve network relationships that increase the risk of HIV/sexually-transmitted infections (STI) acquisition. Affiliation network analysis can serve as a methodological tool to investigate associations between individuals' affiliations with risky social venues and HIV risk or prevention. Affiliation network analysis alone, however, has limitations in providing grounded results. Thus, we propose to validate our findings using biological markers in the HIV virus itself. iMAN will apply phylogenetic techniques to the affiliation network analysis to simultaneously analyze social relations (epidemiology information) and molecular viral relatedness (molecular information) in a multi-level approach. iMAN proposes to use phylogenetic analysis to help characterize the clustering patterns of HIV infection within YBMSM from different patterns of venue affiliation. The objective of iMAN is to characterize the epidemiology of HIV transmission by identifying venue-based clustering of HIV-infected YBMSM across different cities using state-of-the-art molecular epidemiology methods. The resulting venue- based and genetic transmission clusters will be further examined to describe the transmission patterns of the epidemic in Houston and Chicago as well as to compare and contrast the patterns between the two cities. Our specific aims are to (1) identify HIV-transmission clusters and describe the patterns of epidemic spread by identifying (a) genetic clusters between HIV-infected YBMSM using phylogenetic analysis, and (b) venue- based social clusters using affiliation network analysis; (2) compare genetic clusters and venue-based social clusters to determine venue-based HIV risk at the local level. The findings from this research are expected to provide new directions for developing venue-based network interventions informed by molecular science and to have an impact on network interventions that target those most at risk of HIV/STI infection. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the United States, young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) have an extremely high risk of contracting the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) and are the dominant risk group. The goal of the proposed network study is to identify HIV-transmission clusters among HIV-infected YBMSM and to describe patterns of epidemic spread by integrating molecular phylogenetic analysis into affiliation network analyses. The proposed study is relevant to public health, as it addresses fundamental questions about human health behavior, grounded in biological validation, to alleviate racial/ethnic health disparities in HIV-infection rates in regard to YBMSM. The proposed study has the potential to expand the utility of systems science methodologies for understanding and addressing public health issues. This study will provide new directions for developing venue-based network interventions informed by molecular science and will have an impact on network interventions that target those most at risk of HIV/STI infection.",iMAN: Integrated Molecular & Affiliation Network Analysis of HIV Transmission,9103204,R21GM113694,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Geneologies ', ' Genealogy ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' human T lymphotropic virus III ', ' human T cell leukemia virus III ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Infection ', ' Maps ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Trees ', ' United States ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' virus infection ', ' viral infection ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' Virus ', ' General Viruses ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' Molecular Epidemiology ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Gays ', ' Collaborations ', ' Spottings ', ' Genetic ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' tool ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Validation ', ' Viral Epidemiology ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Molecular ', ' sexual relationship ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' virtual ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Network-based ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' viral transmission ', ' virus transmission ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2016,190331,0.013843439593334266
"Influences on risk behaviors among young men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate. I pursue this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) to facilitate my transition towards an independent research career in HIV prevention science. My long-term goal is to become a productive independent HIV prevention behavioral scientist. My goals include the development of HIV prevention interventions - using new and increasingly accessible and influential online media - to address disparities among sexual minority populations across key developmental periods. To date, my training has focused on core strengths and skills in clinical psychology (PhD) and epidemiology (MPH). I have acquired expertise in HIV prevention, behavior change theory, and research methods, with an emphasis on adults. This foundation has prepared me for the proposed next steps of my training, namely, developing expertise in adolescent risk behavior (the time when most risk behavior patterns are established) and the skills necessary for the development, implementation, and evaluation of online prevention interventions and research.  Training plan. The proposed training plan will prepare me to work with adolescent sexual minority populations, a group at significant risk for HIV. Receipt of a K23 award will allow me protected time to acquire the necessary skills. Specifically, with the K23 training I will: (1) acquire the theoretical and methodological skills required for HIV prevention interventions targeting sexual minority populations during adolescence; (2) gain hands-on training in online media-based intervention development, including health communications and media literacy skills; and (3) build the necessary collaboration networks and research infrastructure to enable independence as an NIH-funded investigator. Importantly my training will also increase my sophistication regarding the (4) unique ethical challenges involved in (a) working with a young, often stigmatized population, and (b) delivering online interventions. Both domains are fraught with ethical complexities (e.g., privacy, consent, confidentiality) at a time of rapidly-evolving societal, cultural, health, and technological changes. My training will prepare me to take a leadership role in this emerging and complex research area. Training goals will be achieved through didactic courses, workshops, research experience, and mentoring.  Environment. During the proposed K23, I will be a Research Scientist at The Miriam Hospital and an Assistant Professor at Brown University. At the Miriam, I will have access to the outstanding and highly supportive research environments provided by the Centers for Behavioral and Preventive Medicine and the Centers for AIDS Research. At Brown University, I will have access to the academic resources of the Schools of Medicine and Public Health, including the Alcohol Research Center on HIV. This environment will enhance my training and facilitate my research goals. Through the training, experience, and skills gained as a part of this K23 Award, I will be prepared to pursue funding to conduct a larger randomized controlled trial of an intervention to reduce HIV risk among adolescent sexual minority populations.  Mentors. I will receive mentoring from an outstanding team of internationally recognized and accomplished investigators in HIV prevention and behavioral science, public health, communications, and media literacy.  Proposed research. Young sexual minority males account for a disproportionate number of HIV infections in the United States. Racial and ethnic minority populations are particularly affected. Incidence rates reflect sexual risk behaviors during early sexual experiences. Research suggests that initial sexual risk-taking occurs during adolescence (ages 14-18) among sexual minority males. Therefore, it is important for HIV prevention interventions to target adolescent sexual minority males. Targeting sexual minority males during adolescence will help them learn and establish healthy sexual behaviors early in their psychosexual development, which will have both immediate and long-term health benefits.  Online media use triggers and maintains sexual risk-taking among adolescent sexual minority males. Consequently, it is critical for HIV prevention interventions to address the influence of online media on this population. One way to address this influence is by developing an online sexual health media literacy intervention. To promote adolescent sexual minority males' critical examination of online media and to decrease their sexual risk-taking, I propose a two-stage program of research (i.e., formative research and an exploratory clinical trial) with three aims: (1) develop methods to recruit and retain a racially/ethnically diverse sample of adolescent sexual minority males online using feedback from five focus groups (N ~ 30); (2) develop a brief, online-administered, sexual health media literacy intervention to lower HIV risk behaviors among adolescent sexual minority males using information from a youth advisory board (N ~ 8) and a cross-sectional online survey (N = 200); and (3) conduct an exploratory clinical trial to pilot test the developed online sexual health media literacy intervention for feasibility and acceptability (N = 100). Overall, the proposed research has the potential to reach a wide audience of sexual minority males early in their sexual development, ultimately decreasing their sexual risk-taking and reducing the number of new HIV infections in this population. Further, the proposed research will expand my capacities as an HIV researcher and interventionist and place me at the forefront of online media-based HIV prevention research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescent sexual minority males account for a disproportionate number of new HIV infections in the United States. There is an urgent need for innovative prevention methods for this at-risk group. The proposed research will take advantage the Internet to reach this group - often hidden and difficult to access - early in their development in order to provide them with prevention programming to help them learn and establish healthy sexual behaviors.                  ",Influences on risk behaviors among young men,9060111,K23MH109346,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency

"Research Supplement to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV rates are at catastrophic levels among young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). A study in 21 US cities found that 21% of YBMSM aged 18-29 were HIV+, compared to 9% of Latino and 7% of white young MSM (YMSM), and these disparities are worsening. YBMSM are more likely to be HIV-infected, less likely to be aware of their HIV-infection, and less likely to disclose that they are HIV-infected, relative to men of other ethnic/racial groups. HIV+ YBMSM are also less likely than white MSM to be in treatment for HIV and to have undetectable viral loads (VLs). When HIV+ individuals achieve an undetectable VL, their own health improves, and they are also less infectious to others. Getting to that point, however, requires that HIV+ individuals: (1) know their HIV status; (2) link to HIV care; (3) stay in care over time; (4) begin appropriate treatment; and (5) adhere to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We refer to these steps as engagement in the HIV Care Continuum (CC). While these approaches have great potential to reduce HIV incidence, it is estimated that only 25% of HIV+ people in the US have engaged in the CC to the point of having undetectable VLs. Research suggests that HIV+ YBMSM engage in the CC far less than others. A community-level intervention (CLI) to build and mobilize communities of YBMSM to support HIV+ men to engage in the CC, decrease psychosocial barriers and increase psychosocial facilitators to engage in the CC within those communities may be an efficacious approach to prevent HIV transmission and improve health outcomes for YBMSM. This proposal will test the efficacy of such a CLI model, called United Black Element+ (UBE+). UBE+ will be an adaptation of a current CLI, called UBE. UBE has already engaged hundreds of YBMSM in Dallas TX, and it diffuses support for HIV prevention and creates positive social norms around reducing rates of unprotected sex and increasing regular HIV testing by building an empowered, mobilized YBMSM community. UBE+ will be an adaptation and extension of UBE designed to increase YBMSM's engagement in the CC. The aims of this project are: (1) To adapt and expand UBE into UBE+, a multilevel intervention that includes a new focus on increasing engagement in the CC among HIV+YBMSM, including targeting psychosocial barriers and facilitators to engaging in the CC that are experienced in this community (e.g., HIV stigma and social support); (2) To implement UBE+ in Dallas for 3 years in collaboration with a local AIDS Service Organization currently implementing UBE, the Dallas County Health Department, and the Texas Department of State Health Services' (TDSHS) HIV-STD Program; and (3) To evaluate the efficacy of UBE+ in increasing engagement in the CC in Dallas (utilizing Houston as a control community) using 2 independent methods: (a) a longitudinal cohort of HIV+ YBMSM providing data on engagement in care, and experiences of psychosocial and logistic barriers and facilitators to engagement in care; and (b) public health data that the TDSHS independently collects on HIV+ YBMSM's engagement in the CC. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) are contracting HIV at alarmingly high rates that far exceed other ethnic/racial groups. These disparities are not due to increased risk behavior among YBMSM, but seem to result because YBMSM who are sexually active are more likely to encounter infectious partners. YBMSM are more likely to be HIV+, and less likely to be on treatment for HIV, and to have undetectable HIV viral loads (VLs). When HIV+ men achieve an undetectable VL, their own health improves, and they are also less infectious to others. Getting to that point requires that HIV+ individuals go through a number of steps of engaging in the continuum of care (CC), such as obtaining health care for HIV, and taking medications as prescribed. The goal of this project is to develop, implement, and test a community-level intervention to build and mobilize communities of YBMSM (ages 18-29) to support HIV+ men about engaging in the CC. The intervention is called United Black Element+. The study is being conducted in Dallas and Houston, Texas.",Research Supplement to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research,9245497,R01MH102171,"['Outcome ', ' aged ', ' efficacy testing ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' health data ', ' Relationship-Building ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Age ', ' Be element ', ' Beryllium ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Elements ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' In element ', ' Indium ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' literacy ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' Killings ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Diffuse ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' sexually active ', ' Logistics ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Anal Sex ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' programs ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Frequencies ', ' psychosocial ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' empowerment ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,223677,-0.016105175427460594
"Effects of Acute Alcohol on Sex-Specific Delay Discounting and Subsequent Sexual Decision Making among MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K08 research and training award will enable the PI to develop skills as an independent clinical scientist using advanced research methodology to ultimately (a) uncover new mechanisms of action underlying the association between acute alcohol and risky sexual behavior among men who have sex with men (MSM), and (b) use that knowledge to refine preventative interventions targeting alcohol-related HIV-risk behavior within this high-priority population.. Preliminary findings suggest that domain-general impulsive delay discounting is associated with sexual risk-taking in the context of co-occurring alcohol use. Measures of SSDD tend to outperform domain-general discounting measures in terms of strength of association with risky sexual behavior. The proposed project would be the first to examine the causal effects of acute alcohol on SSDD, and subsequent effects on sexual decision making among MSM. Formative research (Phase 1) will involve qualitative exploration of men's personal experience of sexual impulsivity, as well as qualitative feedback to adapt and refine our experimental paradigm to match the target population. Pilot research (Phase 2) will be conducted to bridge the formative phase and full experimental investigation (Phase 3). Adult MSM who are single, sexually active, and engage in heavy drinking will be recruited from the local community to participate in the qualitative focus groups (Phase 1; N=30-48), pilot testing of experimental protocol (Phase 2; N=12), and the full experimental trial (Phase 3; N=180). The full single-session experiment will employ an alcohol/placebo/nonalcohol design with random assignment to one of three conditions (i.e., alcohol at 0.8g/kg dose, placebo, and true control) to examine the acute effects of alcohol (i.e., both pharmacological and expectancy) on SSDD, and the subsequent effects on risky sexual decision making (i.e., intention to engage in unprotected anal intercourse). This research will lead to subsequent grant applications to (a) extend this line of human laboratory research, and (b) develop a behavioral economic supplement to brief preventative intervention targeting alcohol-related HIV risk behavior. The PI will work with a highly skilled mentorship team (Drs. Peter Monti, Don Operario, James MacKillop, James Murphy, and David Jarmolowicz) to build four areas of expertise relevant to this research agenda: 1) experimental and qualitative research methodology; 2) behavioral economics of sexual decision making; 3) health disparities in MSM populations; and 4) preventative intervention, with specific emphasis on HIV risk behavior. This K08 proposal addresses a key priority in national public health, and the science of alcohol- related HIV-risk behavior, and will fully prepare the PI for an independent research career in clinical science.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Men who have sex with men (MSM) bear the heaviest burden of the HIV epidemic in the United States, and the transmission rate in this population is rising. This project will contribute to a greater understanding of how alcohol influences impulsive decision making and sexual risk taking among MSM. This information will guide the development of new preventative interventions targeting heavy drinking and sexual impulsivity as a means to reduce alcohol-related sexual risk taking and HIV transmission in this high risk and underserved population.            ",Effects of Acute Alcohol on Sex-Specific Delay Discounting and Subsequent Sexual Decision Making among

"Factors influencing vasectomy use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed four-year K01 Population Research Scientist Development Award supports the development of Dr. Kari White as an independent social scientist and public health researcher conducting studies of the impact of health service delivery models and policies on access to and use of highly effective contraception, with the aim of reducing disparities in unintended pregnancy. This is relevant to the NICHD mission and stated interest in research relevant to ensuring that women and men have access to safe, effective and acceptable contraceptive methods. Dr. White brings her solid training in the demography of fertility and use of qualitative and quantitative research methods to the study of contraceptive use. Her career development plan has three main goals: 1) develop expertise in methods to evaluate health services and policy from the individual perspective; 2) gain in-depth knowledge of contraceptive methods and exposure to how contraceptive services are provided; and 3) acquire advanced statistical skills and proficiency working with new data sources to analyze policies and health outcomes. These goals will be met through formal coursework, mentoring from sponsors, directed study with expert advisors, clinical observation, and conferences. She will integrate her current knowledge and skill set with those gained through the career development activities by conducting a study of the individual-, provider- and health systems-level factors contributing to the underutilization of vasectomy among low-income men in the United States. Greater use of vasectomy has the potential to reduce income-based disparities in unintended pregnancy, but there has been limited study of why this method is so little used among low-income men. To comprehensively examine the factors shaping both the demand (individual-level) and supply (provider- and health systems-level) of vasectomy, the research project aims to: 1) assess knowledge, attitudes and interest in vasectomy among low-income men who do not want more children; 2) identify barriers to providing vasectomy services to low-income men among providers at publicly funded family planning organizations and health centers; and 3) evaluate whether expanded Medicaid family planning coverage for low-income men increases vasectomy use and identify the characteristics of men getting vasectomies through the program. In sum, this career development award will provide Dr. White the structured mentoring, advanced multi-disciplinary training, and experience conducting original research that will facilitate her transition to an independent investigator leading studies on contraception. These studies will allow her to make significant contributions to understanding one of the key determinants of unintended pregnancy and that can be used to inform clinical practice and health policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To reduce the persistently high rates of unintended pregnancy in the United States, efforts are needed to increase access to and use of highly effective contraceptive methods. Vasectomy is a safe, highly effective and cost effective method for men and couples who do not want more children, but it is rarely used among low- income groups, who have disproportionately high rates of unintended pregnancy. The proposed study will conduct an in-depth assessment of the existing obstacles to vasectomy among low-income men; these findings will identify potential approaches to improve access to and use of this method that can be used to inform clinical practice and health policy.",Factors influencing vasectomy use,8977519,K01HD079563,"['Age ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Client ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Family Planning ', ' Contraceptives ', ' Contraceptive Agents ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' Counseling ', ' Couples ', ' Data Sources ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Demography ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Female Sterilization ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' Fertility ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Health Services ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Perception ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vasectomy ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' State Interests ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' Inhibition of Fertilization ', ' Fertility Control ', ' Contraception ', ' Contraceptive methods ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' health organization ', ' Provider ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Population Research ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Sum ', ' Cognitive ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Unplanned pregnancy ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' child bearing ', ' childbearing ', ' bearing children ', ' bear children ', ' 20 year old ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' federal poverty level ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K01,2016,130375,0.050036325076214104
"Social-Structural Stressors, Resilience and Sexual Risk Behaviors Among Black Men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to exact a severe toll on Black men in the U.S. Although they represent just 14% of the male population, Black men accounted for 47% of HIV cases among men in 2009. The association between disproportionately high rates of HIV/AIDS in Black communities and social-structural factors such as poverty, neighborhood instability, and incarceration are well documented. Despite increasing advocacy for more social-structural approaches to HIV prevention however, considerable gaps in knowledge exist about how social structural stressors at the population-level and sociodemographic stressors at the individual-level (e.g., individual socioeconomic status, perceptions of racial discrimination) are associated with Black men's sexual HIV risk behaviors. There is also a dearth of knowledge about how resilience at both the neighborhood and individual-level may protect against Black men's sexual HIV risk behaviors. We propose a 5-year cross-sectional multiphase mixed methods study in Philadelphia, PA, in which we use geospatial analysis, qualitative methods, and multilevel quantitative modeling to refine and test a conceptual model of neighborhood-level social-structural stressors, individual-level sociodemographic stressors, psychological risk factors, neighborhood-level and individual-level resilience, and Black men's sexual HIV risk and protective behaviors. The study has 3 phases. Phase I includes focus groups to explore neighborhood-level social- structural stressors and resilience and to inform spatial data analyses of social-structural stressors (e.g., neighborhood poverty, neighborhood instability, crime) that may be associated with Black men's sexual HIV risk behaviors. Phase II involves the multilevel modeling of social-structural and sociodemographic stressors (e.g., individual SES), psychological risk factors, resilience, and sexual HIV risk and protective behaviors with a probability sample of 700 Black men between the ages of 18 and 44, of all sexual orientations, recruited from 100 Census block-groups. Phase III involves the integration of the study's results with spatial data visualization and culturally grounded explanations based on interviews with 30 Black men, followed by focus groups to confirm the study's interpretations. The expected outcome of this innovative study is that it will guide the development of structural interventions to reduce HIV incidence in Black men and their sexual partners regardless of the partners' gender. The overall positive impact of the research is that it will advance empirical knowledge about the multilevel social-structural stressors and resilience of Black men's lives with implications for reducing HIV incidence and other health disparities prevalent among Black men. The proposed study is highly responsive to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy's stated goals of reducing HIV incidence in Black men and women. The disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS among Black men makes the development of innovative HIV prevention research that can inform structural interventions for this population, a top public health priority. The proposed research is highly relevant to public health HIV prevention initiatives in general, and in particular to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy's stated goals of reducing HIV incidence in Black men and women.","Social-Structural Stressors, Resilience and Sexual Risk Behaviors Among Black Men",8902962,R01MH100022,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Perception ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Poverty ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Public Health ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Advocacy ', ' base ', ' psychological stressor ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Phase ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Individual ', ' Knowledge ', ' stressor ', ' Prevention Research ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Population Intervention ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' unstably housed ', ' unstable housing ', ' instably housed ', ' housing instability ', ' protective behavior ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health priorities ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' data visualization ', ' ']",NIMH,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,575996,0.07812067388634635
"The Hampton University regional Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center Hampton University, as the lead institution for the Hampton University (HU)-Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Transdisiplinary Collaborative Center (TCC) for research on men's health, will take a comprehensive approach to narrowing the gender gap of health disparities by harnessing the resources and expertise of eight historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to collaborate in implementing and advancing innovative transdisciplinary research that includes intervention components of research, education and outreach, and training to effectively reduce health disparities in minority men. The primary objective of the HU-HBCU TCC will be to reduce selected health disparities in minority men. It will be achieved through four specific aims: (1) Create a transparent and full participatory coalition of partners to collaboratively design, implement, evaluate and disseminate innovative transdisciplinary programs to reduce health disparities in men; (2) establish four cores and a pilot project program (Administrative, Collaborations and Partnerships, Research, Pilot Projects and Intervention Implementation) to support proposed subprojects and pilot projects, as well as, future research activities;(3) implement a sustainable and transferrable collaborative research model in six areas (cancer; cardiovascular disease, violence prevention and diabetes, obesity, melanoma) to positively influence and health outcomes of minority men; and (4) evaluate research, implementation, and dissemination activities to promote optimal use of the TCCs resources by HBCUs, government, community partners and other vital stakeholders. The potential impact of activities resulting from the HU-HBCU TCC will address the NIH Health Disparities Strategic Plan 2009-2013 as it will harness the resources and expertise of HBCUs to collaborate in implementing and advancing innovative transdisciplinary research. In addition, the proposed research that will be conducted by the HU-HBCU TCC is especially relevant to public health as its major focus includes intervention components of research, education and outreach, and trainging to effectively and efficiently reduce health disparities in minority men. The interdisciplinary research design and methods to achieve the goal and specific aims involve bringing together, scientists, researchers and community representatives to positively impact the health and well-being of minority men by establishing and implementing sub-projects and pilot projects with a regional focus. This proposed coordinated transdisciplinary approach to reduce and ultimately eliminate health disparities will also enable the participating partners to leverage resources and enhance collaboration. The proposed HU-HBCU TCC Project is especially relevant as it proposes to develop research models that will be both sustainable and transferable across communities, regions in the nation.

"Strong Men, Strong Communities: Cultural Tradition to Improve Native Men's Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indian (AI) males experience profound health disparities compared to their counterparts in all other U.S. racial and ethnic groups. For example, AI men have the highest age-adjusted prevalence of type 2 diabetes (~18 percent) among U.S. men, while non-Hispanic White men have the lowest (~7 percent). In recent decades, AIs have seen a disproportionate increase in diabetes-related complications and mortality compared to all other groups, such that age-adjusted diabetes death rates in AI men are now almost twice those in White men. Several large randomized, controlled trials in non-AIs confirm that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed by interventions that promote healthy lifestyles, but little empirical data exist on interventions to prevent diabetes in AI men. In the clinic-based U.S. Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), only 55 out of 3,234 participants were AI men. Similarly, in the diabetes prevention programs in Native communities, participation by AI males is low, ranging from 33 percent to 74 percent. Many explanations have been posited for the low participation rates among men of all races in lifestyle interventions. Recruiting AI men in clinic-based programs is difficult because they tend to seek clinical care less often than women. AI men's perceptions of normative health behaviors and gender roles may also discourage participation, particularly in mixed-gender groups. Therefore, an urgent need exists for diabetes risk reduction programs tailored to the unique values and habits of AI men, with a particular focus on recruitment and retention.  We are collaborating with the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe (Minnesota), the Indian Health Board of Minneapolis (Minnesota), and Yakama Nation and Heritage University Center for Native American Health and Culture (Washington) to develop the Strong Men, Strong Communities (SMSC) program. This is a culturally appropriate approach for AI men that targets modifiable diabetes risk factors. It uses methods adapted from successful, non-clinic based programs for other high-risk minority populations, and it incorporates elements of DPP and SDPI-DP. Our Specific Aims are to:  1) Refine the SMSC intervention with feedback from focus groups in our 3 partner communities.  2) Compare change in diabetes risk score (primary outcome) and modifiable diabetes risk factors (secondary outcomes) in the SMSC intervention and wait-list control groups.  3) Evaluate the ability of SMSC to retain 80 percent of 240 AI male participants, 21-65 years of age with no previous diagnosis of diabetes. The proposed study fills a striking gap in approaches to increase recruitment and participation in lifestyle programs that reduce diabetes risk in AI men. The proposed study will have broad implications for the ongoing epidemic of AI obesity and diabetes. Given the need to increase AI men's participation in lifestyle interventions, our findings might have substantial public health impact on tribal communities across the U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health disparities experienced by American Indian (AI) men compared to AI women and other racial/ethnic groups are striking and the gap is worsening. AI men have a higher prevalence of obesity, diabetes and a higher diabetes-related mortality rate than White men, yet infrequently participate in lifestyle interventions. Our lifestyle intervention could have broad implications given the epidemic of obesity and diabetes among AI men and help identify strategies to increase AI male participation in interventions to reduce the risk for diabetes.","Strong Men, Strong Communities: Cultural Tradition to Improve Native Men's Health",9062440,R01DK102728,"['Age ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Animals ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Control Groups ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Feedback ', ' Fishes ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Gender Role ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Incidence ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Minnesota ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Perception ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Universities ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Washington ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Woman ', ' Bison ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Death Rate ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Native Americans ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Healthy diet ', ' good diet ', ' waist circumference ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' tribal reservation ', ' reservation community ', ' native american reservation ', ' nation reservation ', ' American Indian reservation ', ' Indian reservation ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' diabetes risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Indigenous ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' cost ', ' community intervention ', ' Mille Lacs Band ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Ojibwe ', ' tribal communities ', ' tribal community ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' 21 year old ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', "" men's group "", ' male group ', ' male health ', "" men's health "", ' racial and ethnic ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' community setting ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' retention rate ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' ']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,466708,0.040191217013964414
"Gender Difference in Bladder Cancer Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Men are 3-4 times more likely to develop bladder cancer (BCa) than women are. In fact, the incidence of almost all types of cancer is consistently higher in males than in females. The key difference in genetic makeup between males and females is the sex chromosome complement (XX versus XY). We do not know, however, the extent to which sex chromosomes are responsible for the gender difference of BCa susceptibility. Neither do we know whether sex chromosomes enhance or reduce the gonadal hormone-dependent sexually dimorphic phenotypes. Epigenetic programming in the sexual dimorphism is an emerging field. At present, essentially nothing is known about the epigenetic mechanism of the gender difference in BCa susceptibility. Many epigenetic programs regulate histone methylation to maintain active or silent states of chromatin. The X- linked histone demethylase, Utx/Kdm6a, is an epigenetic regulator that functions in a sex-specific manner during development; this gene is mutated in over 25% of human BCa cases. Furthermore, mutation rates of epigenetic regulators are significantly higher in human BCa than all other epithelial cancers studied in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) projects. Thus, the X-linked, Utx-dependent epigenetic program may impart sex-specific gene expression differences in bladder urothelium, and consequently influence BCa susceptibility. To address questions highlighted above, we will first use a novel mouse model, which consist of the ""four core genotypes""-XX and XY- females with ovaries, and XY-Sry and XXSry males with testes-to investigate whether the gender difference in BCa susceptibility depends on the sex chromosome complement and/or the gonadal types. Second, we will determine whether the Utx-dependent epigenetic program causes the sex disparity in BCa incidence using a mouse conditional knockout (cKO) strategy. Third, we will use genomic technology to identify sexually dimorphic genetic and epigenetic targets of the Utx-dependent epigenetic program. Identification of these molecular features may shed light onto the underlying epigenetic mechanism of the sex disparities of BCa. Together, the proposed studies will significantly improve our understanding of the gender difference in BCa susceptibility, and may substantially alter our view of the emerging paradigm of epigenetic programing in the sex disparities in cancer incidence, and could potentially lead to future epigenetic-based treatment strategies to BCa. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Men are 3-4 times more likely to develop bladder cancer than women are, but the underlying mechanism in essentially unknown. The 5-year survival rate of metastatic bladder cancer is less than 5%. Cigarette smoking is the #1 risk factor; however, smoking itself can not explain the gender differences in bladder cancer incidence. The proposed study investigates other potential risk factors, and suggests epigenetic reprograming may play a major role in bladder cancer susceptibility and sex disparities.",Gender Difference in Bladder Cancer Susceptibility,9115076,R21CA198544,"['Acetylation ', ' Age ', ' Variance Analyses ', ' ANOVA ', ' Analysis of Variance ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' Bladder ', ' Urinary Bladder Malignant Tumor ', ' Urinary Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Bladder ', ' Malignant Bladder Neoplasm ', ' Bladder Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' oncogenic agent ', ' Oncogens ', ' Cancer Causing Agents ', ' Carcinogens ', ' Chromatin ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Histone H3 ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' L-Lysine ', ' Lysine ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Muscle ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Ovary ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' chromosome complement ', ' DNA Ploidy ', ' DNA Index ', ' DNA Content ', ' Ploidies ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Gonosomes ', ' Sex Chromosomes ', ' Smoking ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Testicles ', ' Testis ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' X Chromosome ', ' Y Chromosome ', ' Gender ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Sexism ', ' Gender Bias ', ' Sex Bias ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Epithelial ', ' Urothelium ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Gonadal Hormones ', ' Genetic ', ' programs ', ' Gene Alteration ', ' Gene Mutation ', ' safer sexual behavior ', ' safer sex ', ' Responsible sexual behavior ', ' Responsible Sex ', ' Protected Sex ', ' Safe Sex ', ' sex dimorphism ', ' sexual dimorphism ', ' demethylation ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Genomics ', ' histone modification ', ' Oncogenesis ', ' tumorigenesis ', ' Address ', ' Bladder Transitional Cell Epithelium ', ' Bladder Urothelium ', ' Mutate ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Molecular ', ' Knockout ', ' Knock-out ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' mouse model ', ' murine model ', ' tumor ', ' treatment strategy ', ' The Cancer Genome Atlas ', ' TCGA ', ' genetic makeup ', ' genetic make-up ', ' histone demethylase ', ' histone methylation ', ' transcriptome ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' sex disparity ', ' disparities in sex ', ' ']",NCI,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2016,230985,0.016957545197656746
" A  Multilevel Analysis of Partner Violence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Globally, research on intimate partner violence (IPV) is based on women's reported exposure, with little known about the determinants of men's perpetration. Nascent evidence in poorer settings suggests that childhood experiences and local gender norms may synergistically influence men's risks of perpetration, but these risk factors have not been studied together. In historically patriarchal settings like Bangladesh, norms among senior men about equity-inequity in gender relations and violence against women may influence those of lower-status community members, including younger men. Compared to more senior men, younger men are more likely to be establishing patterns of behavior in marriage, and their behaviors, including the perpetration of IPV, may be more amenable to change. AIMS. Using data from a population- based survey of men in Bangladesh, we will develop and test a novel measurement model for senior men's community-level gender norms. We will use this measure in a multilevel analysis to explore whether living amidst local norms among senior men favoring gender equity and disfavoring violence against women lowers the risk of perpetrating physical IPV among younger men, either directly, and/or by buffering the influence of younger men's exposure to violence in childhood. DATA. The sample includes 961 senior men 35-49 years (y) and 564 ever-married men 18-34 y nested in 50 urban and 65 rural communities who took part in the survey of Men's Attitudes and Practices Regarding Gender and Violence Against Women in Bangladesh. METHODS. We will use 3-level item response theory (IRT) methods to explore and refine the measurement of community- level gender norms among senior men, including an assessment of the measure's dimensionality, reliability, measurement invariance across urban and rural communities, and within-community heterogeneity. We will use multilevel logistic regression to assess (1) the relationship between community gender norms and a younger ever-married man's probability of perpetrating any prior-year physical IPV and (2) whether the association of a younger man's exposure to violence in childhood with his probability of perpetrating recent physical IPV depends on community-level gender norms. Sensitivity analyses will test the robustness of the findings. INNOVATION. Globally, research is lacking on (1) men's perpetration of IPV and (2) the measurement of community-level gender norms among men using advanced methods. Thus, little is known about the associations of community-level gender norms (developed through such measurement models) with younger men's perpetration of IPV, directly and by buffering the potentially adverse influence of childhood exposure to violence. These data offer a rare occasion to explore these understudied relationships. Our novel analytic strategy will advance the fields of study on community gender norms among men and the multilevel determinants of men's IPV perpetration. Our results will inform national policies and community programs to reduce men's perpetration of IPV in Bangladesh, with implications for research and policy in similar settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project, we will develop and test a novel measurement model for senior men's community-level gender norms in Bangladesh, and we will use this measure to explore whether living in a community in which senior men favor gender equity and disfavor violence against women lowers the risk that a younger man will perpetrate IPV, either directly and/or by buffering the influence of his prior exposure to violence in childhood. Advancing knowledge of these under-explored relationships will critically inform national policies and community-level social mobilization programs aimed at reducing younger men's perpetration of IPV in Bangladesh, with extended implications for research and policy in similar low-resource settings.", A  Multilevel Analysis of Partner Violence,9097756,R03HD081438,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Attitude ', ' Bangladesh ', ' Behavior ', ' Buffers ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Ever Married ', ' Fathers ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Gender Role ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Marriage ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Probability ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Rural Community ', ' base ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Ensure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Fostering ', ' Gender Relations ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Wife ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' field study ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Policy Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' violent partner ', ' partner violence ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' violence against women ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' social learning ', ' gender equity ', ' violence perpetration ', ' ']",NICHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R03,2016,78218,0.06343799506696803
"HIV Education for African American Men PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  One in 16 Black men will be diagnosed with HIV in his lifetime as compared to 1 in 102 White men. Nearly 15% of these new HIV cases among African American men are due to heterosexual transmission. Despite this, Black men who have sex with women (MSW) have received very little empirical attention. This is a missed public health opportunity. First, Black men do not routinely use condoms, one of the most effective ways to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV, indicating the potential for substantial behavioral impact. And second, 80% of new HIV infections in African American women are due to sex with men. The intra-racial nature of sexual networks suggests most of these women are infected by Black men. Thus, reducing HIV incidence among Black men should concomitantly reduce HIV disparities among African American women.  The female condom (FC) is an alternative HIV protection method that may overcome a key barrier to male condom use: reduced sexual pleasure. Research shows that Black women respond well to FC education, but gender norms may impede their efforts to introduce FCs to male partners. One way to overcome this is to provide FC training directly to men. Indeed, preliminary research has shown that men report fewer unprotected sex partners after receiving both female and male condom training. In addition, men endorse several benefits to FC use, including that they provide greater sexual sensation than male condoms.  To harness the potential of FCs for Black MSW, we intend to develop Focus, a computer-based HIV behavioral intervention for heterosexually active African American men that provides training in male and female condom use. Focus will computer-enable the core components of Focus on the Future (FOF), the only best-evidence HIV behavioral intervention for Black MSW. The one-hour FOF session addresses the correct and consistent use of male condoms and lubricants, condom negotiation, and the importance of protecting one's future. FOF's main message is that there are many types of condoms and lubricants and men should experiment to find the ones that make sex feel best. By providing FCs as an additional option, Focus aims to lessen the impact of a major barrier to condom uptake: reduced sexual pleasure. Another barrier to Black MSW's HIV risk reduction behavior is belief in a traditional masculine ideology. Black men who espouse these views are more likely to engage in sexual risk behavior. To counteract this, Focus will provide methods to reframe potentially dangerous masculine beliefs into healthier sexual and relationship behaviors.  The results of Phase I strongly support the feasibility and potential effectiveness of Focus, far exceeding the established benchmarks. In Phase II, we will complete development of Focus and test its effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial with 120 African American MSW. Participants will be randomly assigned to either receive the Focus program or the attention control materials. Before, and at two points after random assignment, condom use behaviors as well as condom skills, attitudes, and partner negotiation will be assessed. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop a computer-based HIV prevention program for African American men who have sex with women (MSW) that includes education and training about female and male condoms. The computer- based program will allow clinics to provide an empirically validated HIV prevention intervention to their clients without creating additional demands on their already overburdened staff. The skills contained in this program will help African American MSW protect themselves from sexual HIV risk, with the ultimate goal of reducing health disparities in HIV incidence.",HIV Education for African American Men,9255385,R44HD081992,"['Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Client ', ' Computers ', ' Male Condoms ', ' Consultations ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Gender Role ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterosexuality ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sensation ', ' Esthesia ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Female Condoms ', ' Masculine ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Lifestyle Risk Reduction ', ' Risk Reduction Behavior ', ' uptake ', ' Lubricants ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' Test Result ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Training and Education ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' field study ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' pleasure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Manufacturer ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Interruption ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' sexual relationship ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' prototype ', ' FDA approved ', ' sexual HIV transmission ', ' ']",NICHD,"ISA ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2016,549891,0.10914636944587541
"Sexual Health Disparities in Young Women of Color: A PCMH Needs Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT BACKGROUND. Racial and ethnic disparities are pronounced in sexual and reproductive health outcomes. African American and Hispanic girls (young women of color), comprise 57% of all teen pregnancies1 and 79% of all new HIV infections2, although they represent only 26% of this population2. High rates of medical indigence, related to poverty in young women of color, limit access to quality sexual and reproductive health services3-4. Research has identified barriers that maintain health disparities in healthcare, in particular provider (e.g., lack of training and skills) and patient (e.g., perceived discrimination) level barriers as well as patient-provider communication barriers (e.g., discomfort with sexual health communication)5. The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) is a model of primary care that advocates for quality patient-centered care that is accessible, continuous, and comprehensive6-7. Over 50% of youth have medical homes, and those youth are less likely to have unmet needs and more likely to engage in preventative medical visits in primary care7, though little is known about sexual health care in this context. This model was designed to help underserved communities achieve health equity through culturally-responsive care8. For example, the PCMH model has built-in financial incentives for providers to decrease racial and ethnic health disparities, such as participation in learning collaboratives, including e-learning courses8-9. The PCMH model has already been effective at decreasing healthcare costs and health disparities10. Therefore, the PCMH model is an ideal vehicle by which to reduce the sexual and reproductive health disparities of young women of color. SPECIFIC AIMS. The purpose of the proposed project is to conduct a mixed-methods needs assessment with PCMH providers and young women of color to understand the needs and barriers to quality sexual and reproductive healthcare (on provider and patient levels). The knowledge gained will be used to create a detailed content outline, which will inform next-steps or the development of an e-learning course for time-limited healthcare providers to enhance cultural competency and progress towards health equity. METHODS. A sequential multilevel mixed-methods needs assessment will be conducted with providers and young women of color. The quantitative phase will include survey methods to quantify needs and barriers to quality sexual and reproductive healthcare and to identify major topics and themes to guide discussions during the qualitative phase. The qualitative phase will consist of in-depth individual interviews with physicians and iterative focus groups with young women of color to explore the meaning of these themes and how they may be addressed. During the integration phase, the quantitative and qualitative data will be integrated to create a detailed content outline for the e-learning course. LONG TERM GOAL. My long term goal is to develop a program of health services research focused on culturally-responsive healthcare interventions for youth to address health disparities of major significance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Young women of color are in need of high quality sexual and reproductive healthcare. The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) is a promising vehicle by which to reduce the sexual and reproductive health disparities of young women of color. A needs assessment with PCMH providers and young women of color will result in a comprehensive understanding of needs and barriers to quality healthcare services in this setting. This knowledge will also inform a grant application aimed at developing an e-learning course for time-limited healthcare providers to enhance cultural competence and progress towards health equity.",Sexual Health Disparities in Young Women of Color: A PCMH Needs Assessment,9189251,F32HS024854,[''],AHRQ,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,F32,2016,57042,0.027795819184768287
"MOCHA Moving Forward:  a CBPR investigation of chronic disease prevention in older, low-income African-American men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research is designed to use a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach to achieve three research objectives: (1) to identify factors that can be incorporated into expanded Minority Stress Model developed by the PI; (2) to evaluate the effectiveness of the Men of Color Health Awareness (MOCHA) program, and an enhanced MOCHA+ program that uses narrative communication strategies, in lowering stress and risk of chronic diseases in a randomized controlled trial; and (3) to determine those individual, interpersonal and social structural factors that have an impact on stress and the health of low income African- American men. The MOCHA program is the result of a grassroots, community-driven initiative to address the heavy burden of health disparities experienced by low-income African-American men living in Springfield MA. The MOCHA program is sustained by a public - private collaboration between the local chapter of the YMCA and the state Department of Public Health. The MOCHA program is designed to address the physical, mental, social, and spiritual needs of men of color simultaneously in an integrated fashion. It consists of a 12-week program comprised of: (1) 60-minutes of moderately intensive aerobic exercise twice a week; (2) small group discussions of issues facing men of color, in particular, the potentially harmful effects of socially constructed definitions of black masculinity and associated issues of stress, violence, depression and substance abuse; (3) classes on health topics pertinent to chronic disease control, such as nutrition, obesity, high blood pressure, fitness and the social determinants of health. In utilizing a CBPR methodology, university researchers will partner with the MOCHA Steering Committee in all phases of the research, from identifying the main research questions, to identifying mediating factors implicit in the MOCHA model to utilizing appropriate research instruments to answer the primary research question, to data collection and analysis, to disseminating the results of the research, in appropriate fashion, to different audiences. The proposed research methods include: individual interviews of MOCHA participants, ethnographic field observations of digital storytelling (DST) workshops, survey questionnaires and the collection of physiological measures such as cortisol, blood pressure, and BMI. The results of this research will contribute to the identification of effective interventins to address health disparities in low-income African-American men and the dissemination of effective chronic disease prevention programming.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African-American men continue to bear a disproportionate share of the burden of health disparities, in general, and chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes, in particular. It is vitally important to identify effective strategies to ameliorate these health inequities. The research plan presented here will identify factors that have the greatest influence on stress and health behaviors in low-income African-American men between the ages 45-65, and determine the effectiveness of an innovative, community-driven program to improve the health and quality of life of these men.        ","MOCHA Moving Forward:  a CBPR investigation of chronic disease prevention in older, low-income African-American men",9129365,U01MD010618,"['Aerobic fitness ', ' Aerobic Activity ', ' Aerobic Exercise ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Awareness ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' ELISA ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' Exercise ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Gender Role ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Interview ', ' Logic ', ' Maps ', ' Massachusetts ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mission ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Developing a method to increase HIV testing among YMSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to HIV and account for one quarter of all new infections each year. Most new infections (72%) among adolescents occur among young men who have sex with men (YMSM). Transmission of HIV can be virtually eliminated by treatment, but testing rates are low and a significant proportion of YMSM are unaware of their HIV status. Perceived and actual stigma and discrimination may prevent these young men from engaging in health systems and very few programs have been designed to effectively promote testing among YMSM. This Phase I project will create a theory-based (Information, Motivation, and Behavioral Skills model), serious mobile game to promote HIV testing among YMSM living on the South and West sides of Chicago. Communities comprised predominately of African American and Latino communities. Three specific aims will be completed over a six-month period: (1) Develop the Test prototype with a stakeholder advisory team; (2) Conduct prototype usability, feasibility, and acceptability testing with youth and providers; and (3) prepare for Phase II full development. The Test will directly address the need for innovative solutions to low rates of HIV testing among YMSM using a state-of-the-art, theory-based video game designed specifically for YMSM. This game will engage YMSM in self- paced, developmentally appropriate, interactive instruction and practice to enhance their information, motivation, and behavioral skills with regards HIV testing.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to HIV and account for one-quarter of all new infections each year; approximately 72% of these infections occur among young men who have sex with men (YMSM). HIV can be effectively managed and risk of transmission can be virtually eliminated by treatment, but HIV testing rates remain disproportionately low among YMSM. Accordingly, this STTR project will develop and test a state-of-the-art serious video game entitled The Test in order to affect behavior change. The game will rely upon the Information, Motivation, and Behavioral Skills (IMB) model to increase intentions HIV testing among YMSM.        ",Developing a method to increase HIV testing among YMSM,9147173,R41HD088328,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Chicago ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Video Games ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Businesses ', ' Latino ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' Phase ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Development Plans ', ' Gays ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Health Networks ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Side ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Melissa ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Subgroup ', ' STTR ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Instruction ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' racial and ethnic ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' phase 1 study ', ' Phase I Study ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' YMSM ', ' digital media ', ' adolescent sexual health ', ' juvenile sexual health ', ' ']",NICHD,"RESILIENT GAMES STUDIO, LLC",R41,2016,140161,0.02519633032808411
"HIV Risk Among Trans Partners of MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION: HIV disparities in the U.S. continue to affect the most marginalized groups in this culture. Trans women are 34 times more likely than MSM to contract HIV. Estimated prevalence rates for trans men ranged from 0 to 3%, significantly lower than for trans women, yet considerable unprotected anal and vaginal sex behaviors, sex work and drug use, all known risk factors for HIV, were reported. Prior research among trans women found that rates of unprotected vaginal and anal intercourse were higher with primary partners versus casual or commercial sex partners. This is true for MSM in relationships as well. Yet we know very little about trans persons in primary relationships. Early research by the PI found unique relationship factors associated with risk among MSM couples. We will explore relationship factors for trans men and women in relationship with cis gendered men to identify unique relationship factors associated with risk. We will conduct qualitative interviews with 50 couples comprised of 25 trans women in a primary relationship with a cis man and 25 trans men in a relationship with a cis man. Interviews will be guided by minority stress theory and focus on the intersection of gender identity, ethnic identity and relationship dynamics associated with sexual risk for these groups. Data will be disseminated to community groups and used as the basis for a future intervention study. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV risk behaviors are high among trans men and trans women. HIV prevalence and incidence is particularly high among trans women. Despite this, very little research has been done to identify determinants of risk for these groups. The proposed study will investigate important relationship factors that are associated with risk among trans men and women in relationships with cis gendered men. This is needed because traditional definitions of relationship, gender and sexual origination are no longer binary. We need to understand the intersections of these identities in the context of relationship so that we can develop meaningful HIV prevention interventions. This study will begin to bridge gender identity, ethnic identity and relationship dynamics to understand risk profiles in the context of relationship for trans men and women in relationships with cis gendered men.",HIV Risk Among Trans Partners of MSM,9117368,R21AI116297,"['Affect ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Couples ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Persons ', ' parity ', ' Play ', ' survival sex ', ' commercial sex work ', ' commercial sex ', ' Prostitution ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Hospital Risk Reporting ', ' Risk Management ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' satisfaction ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Gays ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' transgender ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' intimacy ', ' intimate behavior ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' Reporting ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' risk perception ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' trend ', ' sex ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical practice ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' LGBT Health ', ' transgender women ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' transgender men ', ' transmen ', ' transman ', ' trans-men ', ' queer ', ' cisgender ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' ethnic identity ', ' ']",NIAID,SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,168245,0.009014050489201907
"Ectopic adiposity in black men with high type 2 diabetes risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) disproportionately affect black individuals. Generalized obesity and other established risk factors do not explain the racial disparity in T2D, and this is particularly evident among men. Emerging evidence indicates that fat accumulation in non-adipose tissues (referred to as ectopic adiposity) may be associated with T2D, independent of general obesity. Compared to white men, both obese and lean black men have less visceral and liver adiposity, while in contrast, they paradoxically have more skeletal muscle adiposity. Skeletal muscle is crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis, and thus, skeletal muscle adiposity may be the key adipose tissue depot contributing to increased T2D risk in blacks. However, much remains to be learned about the epidemiology of skeletal muscle adiposity, particularly among high-risk black populations. Through the K01 (DK083029) and R03 (DK092348) funded pilot studies for new investigators, the applicant has begun to investigate the epidemiology of skeletal muscle adiposity and other ectopic adipose tissue depots in a well-characterized, large cohort of black men from the Tobago Health Study. This cohort offers a unique opportunity to study a black population with low levels of total adiposity, and low prevalence of other potential confounding variables, but with a high prevalence of T2D, especially among non- obese men. We are proposing to continue and expand upon our preliminary research on ectopic adiposity in this cohort. We will take advantage of our unique resource of archived computed tomography (CT) scan image files from over 1500 black men, aged 40 years and above, to analyze skeletal muscle adiposity changes over an average of nearly 7 years, and characterize the natural history of skeletal muscle adiposity changes with aging in black men, and the temporal relationship of these changes with glucose and insulin homeostasis. We will also use archived biological specimens to measure physiologic markers of potential importance for skeletal muscle adiposity, and test several compelling hypotheses about the etiology and consequences of skeletal muscle adiposity. In addition, we will obtain new CT measures of visceral, liver, abdominal muscle and pericardial adiposity, and will test for an association of abdominal skeletal muscle adiposity with measures of glucose and insulin homeostasis, and determine if these associations are independent of liver, visceral and pericardial adiposity. The proposed study will greatly advance our understanding of ectopic adiposity and its role in T2D among high risk black men. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are escalating at alarming rates and disproportionately affect black individuals.

"Evaluating a Structural and Behavioral HIV Risk Reduction Program for Black Men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the MEN Count intervention, an HIV intervention and prevention program for heterosexual Black men. The MEN Count model integrates HIV risk reduction and gender-equity counseling with housing and employment case management via multiple one-on-one sessions delivered by a peer case manager over 60-90 day period. MEN Count was developed and pilot tested using a CBPR approach via funding from an NIH R21, in Boston, MA. Similar CBPR methods accompanied by a more rigorous evaluation design (i.e., a randomized controlled trial- RCT) will be used to test MEN Count in an employment training community service agency for Black men in Philadelphia (NCCF). Study participants (N=504) will be Black men reporting heterosexual risk for HIV [unprotected sex with a woman in the past 30 days and 2+ female sex partners in the past 6 months] and either current unemployment or homeless in the past 6 months. To evaluate the effectiveness of MEN Count, a two-armed RCT will be conducted in which participants will be randomized to receive either MEN Count or an attention comparison program similar to MEN Count in structure but focused on general men's health- nutrition, exercise and primary health care utilization. We will assess program impact on reduction in number of unprotected sex episodes and incident cases of STI (Chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis) via survey and STI testing, respectively, at baseline and 6 and 12 month follow-ups. Additionally, quality assurance and process evaluation efforts will be conducted to ensure high quality program adherence and delivery, as well as to support program replication should the model prove effective. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the MEN Count intervention, an HIV intervention and prevention program for heterosexual Black men. The MEN Count model integrates HIV risk reduction and gender-equity counseling with housing and employment case management via three one-on-one sessions delivered by a peer case manager over 60-90 day period.

"Health Promotion for Positives: A Randomized Trial with HIV Positive Black Men PROJECT SUMMARY:      This application is in response to RFA-MD-12-001, ""NIMHD Health Disparities Research (R01)."" African  American men who are infected with HIV are living longer and are being impacted by the same chronic  diseases that affect the general population of African American men over 40.  To be sure, African American  men, in general, have disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, kidney  disease, and cancer, particularly prostate and colon cancer.  However, HIV infection is associated with an  increased risk for co-morbidity from chronic diseases.  This increased risk is heightened by HIV infection, but  also its treatment with certain agents used in highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) combinations.  Many  of these chronic illnesses have behavioral components-risk is influenced by what people do and don't do,  their diet, and the amount of physical activity they get.  Although the high risk for multiple behavior-linked  chronic diseases among HIV-positive individuals has been recognized, there is a lack of evidence-based  intervention specifically tailored to their needs. Hence, the broad objective is to reduce the risk of chronic  diseases among HIV positive African American men.  The Specific Aims are to test the efficacy of a theory- based, contextually appropriate health promotion intervention in inducing positive changes in behaviors linked  to risk of chronic diseases among HIV positive African American men age 40 years or older and to identify the  theoretical variables that mediate its efficacy.  The study will utilize a randomized controlled trial.  The  participants will be 384 African American HIV positive men age 40 or older who are receiving HAART for HIV.   The men will be randomized to a theory-based contextually appropriate health promotion intervention that  involves three, 3-hour weekly intervention sessions or an attention-control group.  The health promotion  intervention will be an adaptation of an intervention based on social cognitive theory integrated with formative  research and found to be efficacious in increasing adherence to 5-a-Day diet and physical activity guidelines  and prostate cancer screening guidelines in the applicants' preliminary studies.  Data will be collected at  baseline, immediately post, 3, 6 and 12 months post intervention, which will permit assessment of the short- term and long-term effects of the intervention and whether the intervention's efficacy varies over time.  Audio  computer-assisted self-interviewing will be used to assess self-reported adherence to physical activity  guidelines, 5-a-Day fruit and vegetable guidelines, prostate screening guidelines, and colon cancer screening  guidelines and theoretical mediators of behavior change.  Objective outcomes will include health-related fitness  (6-minute walk test, 1-minute push-up test, 1-minute sit-up test, sit-and-reach test), physiological variables  (blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-hip ratio), and prostate and colon cancer  screening based on medical record review. 8.  PROJECT NARRATIVE     Highly activity antiretroviral treatment (HAART) for HIV has caused dramatic decreases in HIV-related  opportunistic infections and mortality~ hence, people are living longer with HIV.  Aging is associated with  increased risk of chronic diseases, but HIV infection and HAART also heighten these risks.  Even in the  absence of HIV, African American men are at disproportionately high risk for chronic disease morbidity and  mortality.

"The Tuskegee Syphilis Study and the Health of Black Men ABSTRACT  Achieving health equity among demographic groups is a crucial policy aim. Despite this policy focus, substantial gaps in health outcomes between black and white Americans remain, and black men consistently rank lowest on a broad array of health outcomes. A growing body of qualitative literature, as well as anecdotal evidence, suggests that mistrust of healthcare institutions explains some of this inequity. Still, both theoretical and empirical research on the causal role of medical mistrust in health disparities remains thin.  We propose to partially fill this gap in the literature using the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis as a case study. The proposed research will be the first to estimate the impact of the Tuskegee study disclosure in 1972 on the behavior and subsequent health outcomes of black men. Because we observe outcomes and behaviors both before and after the 1972 disclosure, we can quantify the effect in a quasi-experimental context. The timing of the Tuskegee disclosure coincides with the advent of a period of rising mortality inequality for black men relative to their white peers. This divergence, which we date to the mid-1970s, reversed patterns of convergence apparent throughout the 1960s. The role of historic deceptions in the evolution of these disadvantages for black men, along with possible mitigating factors, are understudied but crucially important areas of research that affect disadvantaged populations around the globe.  This project has two specific aims: (1) To estimate the impact of the Tuskegee study disclosure on racial disparities in health-seeking behavior (as reflected in care avoidance and/or delay) and in mortality using predictions derived from economic decision theory. To achieve Aim 1, we have developed a theoretical basis for the evolution of medical mistrust and medical service uptake to inform the proposed empirical methodology. In addition, we propose (2) To evaluate whether the effects of the Tuskegee disclosure on health behaviors and outcomes were mitigated by the availability of minority providers, previous experience with the medical system, or socioeconomic status.  The proposed study has several advantages. First, documenting the temporal profile of racial health disparities among men is a substantial contribution to a thin literature on health outcomes in the years immediately following the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the implementation of Medicare and Medicaid Acts in the United States. Second, medical mistrust is difficult (and unethical) to randomize in an experimental setting, and the Tuskegee event provides a “natural experiment” which is race-specific and has a sharp disclosure date, facilitating comparisons of behavior before and after 1972. The timing of the event also allows us to measure longer-run outcomes for those exposed to information about the event. Third, an exploration of effective strategies to reduce the impact of mistrust on health disparities provides policy-relevant lessons that can aid in furthering the aim of health equity today. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achieving health equity and eliminating health disparities is one of the four overarching goals of Healthy People 2020, although great strides have been made, health disparities between black and white Americans are still profound. The proposed research will provide novel evidence on whether and to what extent mistrust shapes the demand for health care, particularly among minority populations thereby contributing to steep health gradients. Because medical mistrust is difficult (and unethical) to randomize in an experimental setting, we use the Tuskegee syphilis study as a “natural experiment” and examine it impact on health seeking behavior and outcomes; we explore effective strategies to reduce the impact of mistrust on health disparities provides policy-relevant lessons that can aid in furthering the aim of health equity today.",The Tuskegee Syphilis Study and the Health of Black Men,9454739,R03MD011449,"['Affect ', ' Alabama ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Civil Rights ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Theory ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Ebola ', ' Ebola virus ', ' Economics ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Evolution ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hospitalization ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Literature ', ' Deception ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Penicillins ', ' Penicillin Antibiotics ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Syphilis ', ' great pox ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Chills ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Early Intervention ', ' uptake ', ' news ', ' Shapes ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' Health Care Sector ', ' Healthcare Sector ', ' Inferior ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' mortality statistics ', ' disease natural history ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' research study ', ' Study Subject ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' migration ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' combat ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' health equity ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' racial health disparity ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' health seeking behavior ', ' health difference ', ' differences in health ', ' ']",NIMHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R03,2017,91484,0.030442622849775638
"Revealing women's hidden role as critical components of HIV transmission networks in Rakai, Uganda: an interdisciplinary approach ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The burden of HIV is ~60% higher in women than men in sub-Saharan Africa, and this gender inequity is a key challenge to HIV control. Identifying women at greatest risk for HIV and their infecting male partners is critical for effective, targeted control of the African HIV epidemic. It is also vital to identify those HIV-infected women most likely to contribute to ongoing viral spread. However, African women vastly underreport sexual contacts and high risk occupations such as sex work in interview-based surveys and clinical settings making their identification challenging. Here, we propose to use phylogenetic, epidemiological, and qualitative methods to study network drivers of female risk of HIV acquisition and onward transmission to men in the rural Rakai District, Uganda. We will use existing data from the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS), a population- based study of HIV incidence and behaviors in 50 communities (n~17,000). In Aim 1 we will identify HIV- infected women who have central roles in transmission networks using viral phylogenetics and then characterize them with RCCS epidemiological data. We will also conduct in-depth interviews with these women to gain deeper insight into their HIV-related risks and to understand the barriers to reporting these risks. In Aim 2 we will use viral phylogenetics in conjunction with probabilistic statistical models to identify the pool of infecting male partners tat sustain the excess HIV burden among Rakai women. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will use microsimulation models to estimate the potential effectiveness of various combination HIV prevention strategies targeted to high risk subgroups to reduce HIV incidence. The proposed research is part of a K01 award and will provide the applicant with the advanced training in HIV modelling, behavioral science, and phylogenetics necessary to transition to an independent investigator with expertise in the application of interdisciplinary methods to HIV epidemiology and prevention. Results will improve female HIV risk assessment and identify candidate targeted strategies to prevent HIV in African women. It also will provide critical formative data fr a future R01 to implement and empirically assess the effectiveness of targeted interventions to high risk women and their partners in Rakai. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The success of interventions to reduce female HIV risk depends upon an understanding of the drivers of excess HIV infection in women. This project studies network drivers of female HIV risk and onward transmission to men in rural Uganda using interdisciplinary methods. We also explore barriers to HIV risk assessment in a setting where women vastly underreport sex work and risky sexual partnerships. This study will inform targeted PEPFAR initiatives to prevent HIV in high risk African women such as DREAMS.","Revealing women's hidden role as critical components of HIV transmission networks in Rakai, Uganda: an interdisciplinary approach",9242563,K01AI125086,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Epidemic ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Female ', ' Fishes ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Phylogeny ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Uganda ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Rural ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' Viral ', ' success ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Prevention ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Abate ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Gifts ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Length ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' demographics ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' data format ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' ']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,127868,0.03370268202158088
"Sexual Health Disparities in Young Women of Color: A PCMH Needs Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT BACKGROUND. Racial and ethnic disparities are pronounced in sexual and reproductive health outcomes. African American and Hispanic girls (young women of color), comprise 57% of all teen pregnancies1 and 79% of all new HIV infections2, although they represent only 26% of this population2. High rates of medical indigence, related to poverty in young women of color, limit access to quality sexual and reproductive health services3-4. Research has identified barriers that maintain health disparities in healthcare, in particular provider (e.g., lack of training and skills) and patient (e.g., perceived discrimination) level barriers as well as patient-provider communication barriers (e.g., discomfort with sexual health communication)5. The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) is a model of primary care that advocates for quality patient-centered care that is accessible, continuous, and comprehensive6-7. Over 50% of youth have medical homes, and those youth are less likely to have unmet needs and more likely to engage in preventative medical visits in primary care7, though little is known about sexual health care in this context. This model was designed to help underserved communities achieve health equity through culturally-responsive care8. For example, the PCMH model has built-in financial incentives for providers to decrease racial and ethnic health disparities, such as participation in learning collaboratives, including e-learning courses8-9. The PCMH model has already been effective at decreasing healthcare costs and health disparities10. Therefore, the PCMH model is an ideal vehicle by which to reduce the sexual and reproductive health disparities of young women of color. SPECIFIC AIMS. The purpose of the proposed project is to conduct a mixed-methods needs assessment with PCMH providers and young women of color to understand the needs and barriers to quality sexual and reproductive healthcare (on provider and patient levels). The knowledge gained will be used to create a detailed content outline, which will inform next-steps or the development of an e-learning course for time-limited healthcare providers to enhance cultural competency and progress towards health equity. METHODS. A sequential multilevel mixed-methods needs assessment will be conducted with providers and young women of color. The quantitative phase will include survey methods to quantify needs and barriers to quality sexual and reproductive healthcare and to identify major topics and themes to guide discussions during the qualitative phase. The qualitative phase will consist of in-depth individual interviews with physicians and iterative focus groups with young women of color to explore the meaning of these themes and how they may be addressed. During the integration phase, the quantitative and qualitative data will be integrated to create a detailed content outline for the e-learning course. LONG TERM GOAL. My long term goal is to develop a program of health services research focused on culturally-responsive healthcare interventions for youth to address health disparities of major significance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Young women of color are in need of high quality sexual and reproductive healthcare. The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) is a promising vehicle by which to reduce the sexual and reproductive health disparities of young women of color. A needs assessment with PCMH providers and young women of color will result in a comprehensive understanding of needs and barriers to quality healthcare services in this setting. This knowledge will also inform a grant application aimed at developing an e-learning course for time-limited healthcare providers to enhance cultural competence and progress towards health equity.",Sexual Health Disparities in Young Women of Color: A PCMH Needs Assessment,9444919,F32HS024854,[''],AHRQ,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,F32,2017,2385,0.027795819184768287
"Examining Modifiable Psychosocial Predictors of HIV Seroconversion in a Large Nationwide Cohort of High Risk Men Project Summary Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) remain a population in the U.S. for whom the burden of HIV is high and disproportionate, particularly among younger GBMSM and GBMSM of color, for whom HIV incidence continues to rise despite decades of HIV prevention research to curb the epidemic. However, even among these highest risk groups, risk for infection is not equivalent and the goal of this study is to better understand what factors differentiate levels of risk for HIV infection. Research to date suggests that this disproportionate burden is likely to be exacerbated by psychosocial disparities faced by this population in the form of syndemics and sexual minority stress. However, research on these factors has been limited by a focus on risk for HIV infection operationalized as risk behavior or cross-sectional prevalence of HIV, making actual vulnerability to infection and temporal associations difficult, if not impossible, to determine. We are submitting this application in response to RFA-AI-16-031 Limited Interaction Targeted Epidemiology (LITE) to Advance HIV Prevention (UG3/UH3). We propose to recruit and enroll a large and diverse cohort of approximately 8,000 GBMSM ages 16 and older in the U.S. and Puerto Rico who are at high risk for infection. We will utilize mobile sexual networking applications (“mobile apps”) to identify and enroll these men both to allow for rapid and efficient recruitment and because these apps rapidly increasing in popularity, with research demonstrating that men who use mobile apps are at higher levels of risk for HIV infection than GBMSM recruited through other means. Using this cohort, we will work to achieve three primary aims: (1) we will establish HIV prevalence as well as prevalence of rectal sexually transmitted infections (STIs; gonorrhea and chlamydia) at baseline and subsequently establish rates of HIV and rectal STI incidence among these men 12 months thereafter; (2) we will utilize baseline levels of syndemic, minority stress, and other relevant psychosocial risk factors to develop a model of those modifiable factors that contribute to increased risk for HIV seroconversion (i.e., incidence) as well as rectal STI infection; (3) we will utilize the model to target men in the highest quartile of risk for HIV seroconversion in the cohort and follow them every 6 months thereafter for an additional two years to examine the predictive utility in prospectively predicting HIV seroconversion as well as time to seroconversion. Developing a model of modifiable psychosocial risk factors for actual HIV seroconversion and subsequently testing its reliability and validity in a prospective design has high potential to improve the next generation of HIV prevention interventions aimed at reducing disparities for this population. Project Narrative Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are at disproportionately high risk for HIV infection compared to other groups, but little research has been powered to examine factors associated with their increased susceptibility as measured with biological indicators and prospective HIV serconversion (i.e., incidence). In this study, we will establish a large nationwide cohort of GBMSM at risk for HIV and follow them longitudinally to examine psychosocial predictors of seroconversion. Specifically, we will integrate two prominent psychosocial models of HIV risk for GBMSM—syndemics and minority stress—to identify modifiable targets for future intervention that increase are associated with risk for HIV as measured by rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia infection in addition to actual HIV infection (i.e., seroconversion).",Examining Modifiable Psychosocial Predictors of HIV Seroconversion in a Large Nationwide Cohort of High Risk Men,9393474,UG3AI133674,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' juvenile sex abuse ', ' childhood sexual abuse ', ' Child Sexual Molestation ', ' Child Sexual Abuse ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' chlamydial disease ', ' Chlamydial Infection ', ' Chlamydia Infections ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Color ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Puerto Rico ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' rectal ', ' Distal ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Gays ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Anal Sex ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention program ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' sexual minority ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' seroconversion ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NIAID,HUNTER COLLEGE,UG3,2017,1375344,0.030931711783501466
"Factors influencing vasectomy use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed four-year K01 Population Research Scientist Development Award supports the development of Dr. Kari White as an independent social scientist and public health researcher conducting studies of the impact of health service delivery models and policies on access to and use of highly effective contraception, with the aim of reducing disparities in unintended pregnancy. This is relevant to the NICHD mission and stated interest in research relevant to ensuring that women and men have access to safe, effective and acceptable contraceptive methods. Dr. White brings her solid training in the demography of fertility and use of qualitative and quantitative research methods to the study of contraceptive use. Her career development plan has three main goals: 1) develop expertise in methods to evaluate health services and policy from the individual perspective; 2) gain in-depth knowledge of contraceptive methods and exposure to how contraceptive services are provided; and 3) acquire advanced statistical skills and proficiency working with new data sources to analyze policies and health outcomes. These goals will be met through formal coursework, mentoring from sponsors, directed study with expert advisors, clinical observation, and conferences. She will integrate her current knowledge and skill set with those gained through the career development activities by conducting a study of the individual-, provider- and health systems-level factors contributing to the underutilization of vasectomy among low-income men in the United States. Greater use of vasectomy has the potential to reduce income-based disparities in unintended pregnancy, but there has been limited study of why this method is so little used among low-income men. To comprehensively examine the factors shaping both the demand (individual-level) and supply (provider- and health systems-level) of vasectomy, the research project aims to: 1) assess knowledge, attitudes and interest in vasectomy among low-income men who do not want more children; 2) identify barriers to providing vasectomy services to low-income men among providers at publicly funded family planning organizations and health centers; and 3) evaluate whether expanded Medicaid family planning coverage for low-income men increases vasectomy use and identify the characteristics of men getting vasectomies through the program. In sum, this career development award will provide Dr. White the structured mentoring, advanced multi-disciplinary training, and experience conducting original research that will facilitate her transition to an independent investigator leading studies on contraception. These studies will allow her to make significant contributions to understanding one of the key determinants of unintended pregnancy and that can be used to inform clinical practice and health policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To reduce the persistently high rates of unintended pregnancy in the United States, efforts are needed to increase access to and use of highly effective contraceptive methods. Vasectomy is a safe, highly effective and cost effective method for men and couples who do not want more children, but it is rarely used among low- income groups, who have disproportionately high rates of unintended pregnancy. The proposed study will conduct an in-depth assessment of the existing obstacles to vasectomy among low-income men; these findings will identify potential approaches to improve access to and use of this method that can be used to inform clinical practice and health policy.",Factors influencing vasectomy use,9184051,K01HD079563,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Client ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Family Planning ', ' Contraceptives ', ' Contraceptive Agents ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' Counseling ', ' Couples ', ' Data Sources ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Demography ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Female Sterilization ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' Fertility ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Health Services ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Perception ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vasectomy ', ' Woman ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' State Interests ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' Contraceptive methods ', ' Inhibition of Fertilization ', ' Fertility Control ', ' Contraception ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Provider ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Low income ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Sum ', ' Cognitive ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Unplanned pregnancy ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' child bearing ', ' childbearing ', ' bearing children ', ' bear children ', ' 20 year old ', ' twenty years of age ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' 20 years of age ', ' federal poverty level ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' lower income families ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K01,2017,130377,0.050036325076214104
"Influences on risk behaviors among young men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate. I pursue this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) to facilitate my transition towards an independent research career in HIV prevention science. My long-term goal is to become a productive independent HIV prevention behavioral scientist. My goals include the development of HIV prevention interventions - using new and increasingly accessible and influential online media - to address disparities among sexual minority populations across key developmental periods. To date, my training has focused on core strengths and skills in clinical psychology (PhD) and epidemiology (MPH). I have acquired expertise in HIV prevention, behavior change theory, and research methods, with an emphasis on adults. This foundation has prepared me for the proposed next steps of my training, namely, developing expertise in adolescent risk behavior (the time when most risk behavior patterns are established) and the skills necessary for the development, implementation, and evaluation of online prevention interventions and research.  Training plan. The proposed training plan will prepare me to work with adolescent sexual minority populations, a group at significant risk for HIV. Receipt of a K23 award will allow me protected time to acquire the necessary skills. Specifically, with the K23 training I will: (1) acquire the theoretical and methodological skills required for HIV prevention interventions targeting sexual minority populations during adolescence; (2) gain hands-on training in online media-based intervention development, including health communications and media literacy skills; and (3) build the necessary collaboration networks and research infrastructure to enable independence as an NIH-funded investigator. Importantly my training will also increase my sophistication regarding the (4) unique ethical challenges involved in (a) working with a young, often stigmatized population, and (b) delivering online interventions. Both domains are fraught with ethical complexities (e.g., privacy, consent, confidentiality) at a time of rapidly-evolving societal, cultural, health, and technological changes. My training will prepare me to take a leadership role in this emerging and complex research area. Training goals will be achieved through didactic courses, workshops, research experience, and mentoring.  Environment. During the proposed K23, I will be a Research Scientist at The Miriam Hospital and an Assistant Professor at Brown University. At the Miriam, I will have access to the outstanding and highly supportive research environments provided by the Centers for Behavioral and Preventive Medicine and the Centers for AIDS Research. At Brown University, I will have access to the academic resources of the Schools of Medicine and Public Health, including the Alcohol Research Center on HIV. This environment will enhance my training and facilitate my research goals. Through the training, experience, and skills gained as a part of this K23 Award, I will be prepared to pursue funding to conduct a larger randomized controlled trial of an intervention to reduce HIV risk among adolescent sexual minority populations.  Mentors. I will receive mentoring from an outstanding team of internationally recognized and accomplished investigators in HIV prevention and behavioral science, public health, communications, and media literacy.  Proposed research. Young sexual minority males account for a disproportionate number of HIV infections in the United States. Racial and ethnic minority populations are particularly affected. Incidence rates reflect sexual risk behaviors during early sexual experiences. Research suggests that initial sexual risk-taking occurs during adolescence (ages 14-18) among sexual minority males. Therefore, it is important for HIV prevention interventions to target adolescent sexual minority males. Targeting sexual minority males during adolescence will help them learn and establish healthy sexual behaviors early in their psychosexual development, which will have both immediate and long-term health benefits.  Online media use triggers and maintains sexual risk-taking among adolescent sexual minority males. Consequently, it is critical for HIV prevention interventions to address the influence of online media on this population. One way to address this influence is by developing an online sexual health media literacy intervention. To promote adolescent sexual minority males' critical examination of online media and to decrease their sexual risk-taking, I propose a two-stage program of research (i.e., formative research and an exploratory clinical trial) with three aims: (1) develop methods to recruit and retain a racially/ethnically diverse sample of adolescent sexual minority males online using feedback from five focus groups (N ~ 30); (2) develop a brief, online-administered, sexual health media literacy intervention to lower HIV risk behaviors among adolescent sexual minority males using information from a youth advisory board (N ~ 8) and a cross-sectional online survey (N = 200); and (3) conduct an exploratory clinical trial to pilot test the developed online sexual health media literacy intervention for feasibility and acceptability (N = 100). Overall, the proposed research has the potential to reach a wide audience of sexual minority males early in their sexual development, ultimately decreasing their sexual risk-taking and reducing the number of new HIV infections in this population. Further, the proposed research will expand my capacities as an HIV researcher and interventionist and place me at the forefront of online media-based HIV prevention research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescent sexual minority males account for a disproportionate number of new HIV infections in the United States. There is an urgent need for innovative prevention methods for this at-risk group. The proposed research will take advantage the Internet to reach this group - often hidden and difficult to access - early in their development in order to provide them with prevention programming to help them learn and establish healthy sexual behaviors.",Influences on risk behaviors among young men,9229594,K23MH109346,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency

"Siempre Seguiré: A Pilot Intervention to Improve Coping with Discrimination and Adherence among HIV-Positive Latino MSM PROJECT SUMMARY HIV-related disparities in diagnosis and disease outcomes persist among Latinos, and Latinos living with HIV show a lower percentage of viral suppression compared to the general HIV-positive population. A growing body of work suggests that stigma and discrimination contribute to health disparities, especially among people living with HIV, who may experience discrimination due to multiple stigmatized identities related to HIV- serostatus, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Internalized stigma and discrimination may lead to health- related disparities by increasing detrimental physiological stress responses, resulting in maladaptive coping and poor health behaviors, including non-adherence to treatment. Moreover, the chronic stress of discrimination may weaken immune function, leading to worse HIV outcomes, including increased HIV viral load. In the proposed research, we will integrate adherence skills-building strategies into a recently developed intervention, Siempre Seguiré, a 7-session group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention for HIV- positive Latino men who have sex with men (LMSM) that aims to improve adaptive coping responses to discrimination. In a small pilot of 30 participants, the intervention was associated with improved coping at follow-up as compared to baseline. However, this pilot did not include a control group, did not address or examine HIV-related behaviors and outcomes such as adherence, retention in care, and viral load suppression, and had a very low sample size. Thus, in the proposed research, we will conduct a larger pilot study in which preliminary effects on HIV outcomes can be assessed. The specific aims are: (1) To modify and refine Siempre Seguiré, a newly developed culturally congruent CBT group intervention for HIV-positive LMSM, to include strategies for antiretroviral treatment adherence and retention in HIV care; and (2) To conduct a small randomized pilot of Siempre Seguiré to examine feasibility and acceptability, as well as to explore preliminary effects on: (a) coping responses to discrimination; and (b) antiretroviral treatment adherence, viral load suppression, and HIV care retention, among LMSM living with HIV. In Phase 1, we will work with HIV treatment adherence intervention experts and key stakeholders, including a community advisory board, to refine our pilot intervention as needed and update our manual to integrate information and skills building regarding HIV treatment adherence and retention in care. In Phase 2, we will conduct a small randomized controlled trial of 80 participants (40 intervention participants divided evenly over 4 intervention groups vs. 40 wait-list control participants). To our knowledge, our study will be the first to test an intervention that addresses coping with discrimination from multiple identities. Our proposed research is consistent with the Institute of Medicine report, The Health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People, which recommends developing interventions to address racial disparities and mental health effects of discrimination among sexual minorities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Latinos in the U.S., especially those who are men who have sex with men, show HIV-related disparities, tending to be diagnosed at a later disease stage, leading to delays in care entry and antiretroviral treatment use, and lower rates of viral suppression. No culturally congruent interventions have been developed to address stress resulting from discrimination, a key contributor to disparities in HIV outcomes among Latino men who have sex with men. We propose to integrate adherence skills-building into a recently developed intervention that addresses coping with discrimination among Latino men who have sex with men.",Siempre Seguiré: A Pilot Intervention to Improve Coping with Discrimination and Adherence among HIV-Positive Latino MSM,9407123,R34MH113413,"['Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' County ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Immigrant ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Event ', ' Viral ', ' Services ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' experience ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' immune function ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' treatment adherence ', ' intervention effect ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' sexual minority ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' intersectionality ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Anger ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Control Groups ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Frustration ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Immigration ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Prejudice ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Self Concept ', ' Support Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Shame ', ' Stereotyping ', ' ']",NIMH,RAND CORPORATION,R34,2017,194834,-0.008389289988820155
"Reproductive health disparities and sexual orientation in girls and women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to their heterosexual peers, sexual minority (i.e., lesbian and bisexual) female youth are particularly vulnerable to having poor health, especially poor reproductive health. Emerging research shows that the health of sexual minorities can be adversely affected by state-level discriminatory laws. This discrimination can occur in states that have failed to enact protections around hate crimes, job discrimination, or same-sex marriage. However, little is known about the association of these types of public policies with reproductive health. Policy environments are also highly variable across U.S. states and dynamic across time, as demonstrated by the U.S. Supreme Court overturning the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013. Therefore, this research is vital for understanding how the rapidly shifting policy environment may affect sexual minorities. Empirical evidence is needed to inform new public policy development and public health strategies to improve reproductive health, but few researchers have the training needed to explore such disparities and translate findings into action.  In the proposed project, Dr. Charlton argues that public policy may be associated with the reproductive health of sexual minority girls and women. She will explore this through the following aims: (1) Identify how public policy may be associated with the reproductive health of sexual minority girls and women; (2) Elucidate what adverse reproductive health outcomes may be associated with public policy among sexual minority girls and women and where these reproductive health outcomes occur; and (3) Examine potential reasons why adverse reproductive health outcomes disproportionately burden sexual minority girls and women. To fulfill these aims, national data will be analyzed from two longitudinal cohorts of adolescents and young adults (Growing Up Today Study I/II) along with a cohort of their mothers (Nurses' Health Study II).  In order complete the proposed research, Dr. Charlton must build on her epidemiology skills with formal training in health-related public policy. As such, her mentors have developed a plan to advance her training in areas such as policy analysis and econometrics. This training will enable her to create a comprehensive database representing the various policy environments in every U.S. state and analyze how this environment is associated with the reproductive health of sexual minority girls and women. The proposed research is in line with the NICHD Office of Health Equity's initiatives and will be among the firs to examine public policy and a range of reproductive health issues among sexual minority girls and women. Dr. Charlton will have access is to uniquely detailed data and her findings will further the understanding of sexual orientation health disparities and promote research in diverse populations. This training and research will give Dr. Charlton a solid foundation in health-related public policy, which, combined with her epidemiology background, will enable her to build a career as an independent research scientist.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will explore the association of discriminatory public policies (e.g., same-sex marriage bans) and the reproductive health of sexual minority girls and women, a population that experiences a disproportionate burden of reproductive disease. The results of this project can help clarify mechanisms of health risk as well as potential interventions for health promotion. In doing so, this project has high potential for publc health impact because it can inform future interventions and the development of health-related public policy strategies.            ",Reproductive health disparities and sexual orientation in girls and women,9392252,F32HD084000,"['adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' Crime ', ' Data Collection ', ' Daughter ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Hate ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Laws ', ' Marriage ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Nurses ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Pregnancy in Adolescence ', ' adolescents who are pregnant ', ' Underage Pregnancy ', ' Teenage Pregnancy ', ' Teen Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Minors ', ' Adolescent Pregnancy ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Policy Analyses ', ' Policy Analysis ', ' Competence ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' career ', ' court ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Solid ', ' Medical ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Policies ', ' Lesbian ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Shapes ', ' Scientist ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' reproductive ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' girls ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', "" Nurses' Health Study "", ' Heterosexuals ', ' minority health ', ' Unplanned pregnancy ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' initiation of intercourse ', ' early sexual initiation ', ' early sex initiation ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' sexual debut ', ' sexual initiation ', ' initiation of sexual activity ', ' sexual minority ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' same-sex marriage ', ' Same-sex ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' ']",NICHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,F32,2017,1400,0.0204600370480087
"The Hampton University regional Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center Hampton University, as the lead institution for the Hampton University (HU)-Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Transdisiplinary Collaborative Center (TCC) for research on men's health, will take a comprehensive approach to narrowing the gender gap of health disparities by harnessing the resources and expertise of eight historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to collaborate in implementing and advancing innovative transdisciplinary research that includes intervention components of research, education and outreach, and training to effectively reduce health disparities in minority men. The primary objective of the HU-HBCU TCC will be to reduce selected health disparities in minority men. It will be achieved through four specific aims: (1) Create a transparent and full participatory coalition of partners to collaboratively design, implement, evaluate and disseminate innovative transdisciplinary programs to reduce health disparities in men; (2) establish four cores and a pilot project program (Administrative, Collaborations and Partnerships, Research, Pilot Projects and Intervention Implementation) to support proposed subprojects and pilot projects, as well as, future research activities;(3) implement a sustainable and transferrable collaborative research model in six areas (cancer; cardiovascular disease, violence prevention and diabetes, obesity, melanoma) to positively influence and health outcomes of minority men; and (4) evaluate research, implementation, and dissemination activities to promote optimal use of the TCCs resources by HBCUs, government, community partners and other vital stakeholders. The potential impact of activities resulting from the HU-HBCU TCC will address the NIH Health Disparities Strategic Plan 2009-2013 as it will harness the resources and expertise of HBCUs to collaborate in implementing and advancing innovative transdisciplinary research. In addition, the proposed research that will be conducted by the HU-HBCU TCC is especially relevant to public health as its major focus includes intervention components of research, education and outreach, and trainging to effectively and efficiently reduce health disparities in minority men. The interdisciplinary research design and methods to achieve the goal and specific aims involve bringing together, scientists, researchers and community representatives to positively impact the health and well-being of minority men by establishing and implementing sub-projects and pilot projects with a regional focus. This proposed coordinated transdisciplinary approach to reduce and ultimately eliminate health disparities will also enable the participating partners to leverage resources and enhance collaboration. The proposed HU-HBCU TCC Project is especially relevant as it proposes to develop research models that will be both sustainable and transferable across communities, regions in the nation. While the preponderance of research efforts to improve health outcomes has tended to focus on research and treatment for education and awarness, we are confident that our inovative comprehensive approach will be more effective and efficient.",The Hampton University regional Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center,9322878,U54MD008621,"['neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' melanoma ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Universities ', ' Gender ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' prevent violence ', ' violence prevention ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Research Activity ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' male health ', "" men's health "", ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' ']",NIMHD,HAMPTON UNIVERSITY,U54,2017,4824660,0.03889419349531344
"Project PRIDE: Intervention to Reduce HIV risk in Young Sexual Minority Men PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Young gay and bisexual men are disproportionately affected by HIV, accounting for the majority of new HIV cases among youth. Young gay and bisexual men face specific challenges that increase their risk for HIV transmission. These challenges include the stress associated with having a stigmatized non-heterosexual identity and the negative health outcomes associated with this stress, including alcohol and drug use, condomless sex, and poor mental health. There is a need to develop and test interventions that target these specific risk factors in order to prevent HIV transmission among young gay and bisexual men. The purpose of the proposed project is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of a novel, theory-based primary HIV- prevention intervention. This intervention, entitled Project PRIDE (Promoting Resilience In Discriminatory Environments), consists of 8 sessions and is delivered to young gay and bisexual men aged 18-25. Project PRIDE focuses on the development of adaptive coping strategies to deal with gay/bisexual-related stress in order to reduce alcohol and drug use, condomless sex, and mental health problems. The specific aims of the proposed project are to (1) randomize 123 racially/ethnically-diverse, HIV-negative young gay and bisexual men to one of two conditions: either the intervention condition, which will receive Project PRIDE immediately, or the wait-list control condition, which will wait approximately 5 months before receiving Project PRIDE, and (2) test the feasibility of obtaining biological measures of stress, drug use, and HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs; i.e., syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia), including saliva samples to assess the stress hormone cortisol, urine samples to assess drug use, and urine/blood/oral swabs to assess HIV and other STIs. To meet these aims, we will recruit participants in Houston, TX, through a health services agency and through study advertisements targeted to venues, both physical and virtual, frequented by young gay and bisexual men. Eligible participants will complete self-report measures, including sexual behavior, mental health, and coping, among others, in addition to biological measures. The effects of the intervention will be examined immediately after the conclusion of Project PRIDE and again 3 months later in both the intervention condition and the wait-list control condition. Study results will be used to inform a subsequent NIH application to test the efficacy of a large-scale randomized controlled trial in reducing condomless sex, drug and alcohol use, and negative mental health outcomes among young gay and bisexual men. Moreover, the results have important implications for public health and have the potential to reduce drug use, mental health problems, and HIV risk among a population at high risk for negative health outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men are overrepresented among new HIV cases, with HIV incidence rates increasing among young gay and bisexual men. As such, there is a need to develop effective HIV-prevention interventions that target young gay and bisexual men and focus on reducing their particular risk factors for HIV. The proposed project will pilot test a randomized controlled trial of a psychoeducational intervention for young gay and bisexual men that focuses on developing adaptive coping strategies to reduce substance use, HIV risk behaviors, and negative mental health outcomes.",Project PRIDE: Intervention to Reduce HIV risk in Young Sexual Minority Men,9270987,R21DA041250,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', '

"Restore: Improving Sexual Outcomes of Gay and Bisexual Prostate Cancer Survivors Abstract: This application, in response to PA-15-261, “Research leading to interventions to ameliorate health disparities of sexual and gender minorities”, advances research in three areas. First, prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM), with documented disparities, yet it is severely under-researched. Because gay sex differs from vaginal sex, physiologically; the results from 614 studies focused on heterosexual men likely do not generalize to GBM with PCa. There have been no rehabilitation studies specific to GBM survivors of PCa, so clinicians have no relevant studies to inform best practice with their GBM patients. Second, most PCa studies have tested one or rehabilitation components. We will conduct the first treatment study of a state of clinical practice comprehensive rehabilitation program on GBM's quality of life, including on both urinary and sexual function and bother measures. Third, almost all PCa studies have focused on men recently treated for PCa. We will study both GBM recently treated (last 2 years) and GBM post-treatment (2+ years), using a stratified design.  This study builds on our findings in Restore, an R21 which was only the second study of GBM with PCa to be funded by NCI, and the first to reach publication. We conducted N=41 in-depth qualitative interviews with good saturation, and the largest quantitative study of GBM with PCa to date (N=193), the first needs assessment of GBM with PCa, and the first study of same sex partners and care-givers of GBM. Participants described radical prostatectomy as leaving them “humiliated,” “maimed”, “less than other gay men,” and “severely depressed.” Most (88%) reported ongoing sexual challenges contributing to decreased quality of life, poorer mental health, identity challenges and deteriorated primary relationships. Only three of the eight (38%) outcomes commonly experienced by most GBM were discussed as part of treatment. There was no evidence of any standard of professional rehabilitation; indeed, most GBM just treated themselves.  The long-term objective of this research is to improve the health of GBM survivors of PCa and to provide an evidence base for rehabilitation. In Aim I, we will develop an online rehabilitation program tailored for GBM that addresses both the sexual and urinary effects of PCa treatment. In Aim II, we will conduct a comparative recruitment study to identify best methods to recruit 450 GBM with PCa. In Aim III, we will evaluate the effects of the tailored rehabilitation program on sexual and urinary outcomes. We will conduct a 24 month, randomized controlled trial of structured rehabilitation versus routine care. This RCT will identify whether a structured rehabilitation program is effective in addressing the major sexual and urinary problems caused by PCa treatment. As the first treatment study to focus on GBM with PCa (and also on oral and anal sex), it addresses a long-standing health disparity. The study has high potential to transform rehabilitation for GBM with PCa, provide a critical evidence base for clinicians, and inform rehabilitation outcomes for all PCa survivors. PCa is the second most common cancer in GBM, yet it has been severely under-researched. Because there have been no treatment studies of GBM with PCa, we do not know how well treatments work in this population. Because gay sex differs from vaginal sex, physiologically; the results from 614 studies focused on heterosexual men likely do not generalize to GBM with PCa. This study will test the effects of a multi- component online treatment program tailored for GBM survivors on their sexual and urinary outcomes. If successful, the study will demonstrate a new standard of rehabilitation care for this population.",Restore: Improving Sexual Outcomes of Gay and Bisexual Prostate Cancer Survivors,9365456,R01CA218657,"['post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Exercise ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Interview ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urinary Incontinence ', ' Vacuum Pumps ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Survivors ', ' Pelvic Floor ', ' Pelvic floor structure ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' Anal Sex ', ' Oral Sex ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Bladder Control ', ' urination control ', ' urinary control ', ' urinary continence ', ' micturition control ', ' bladder continence ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Sexual Dysfunction ', ' Sex Disorders ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' Rehabilitation Outcome ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' treatment program ', ' Reporting ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' urinary ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' treatment center ', ' sexual functioning ', ' Sex Functioning ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' treatment effect ', ' comparative ', ' demographics ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' routine care ', ' clinical practice ', ' arm ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' same-sex couple ', ' same sex relationship ', ' same sex partner ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' community center ', ' rehabilitative care ', ' rehabilitation care ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2017,620544,-0.022596775816505994
"Health, Stress, and Tobacco Use Disparities among Sexual Minority Populations PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In response to PA-15-261: The Health of Sexual and Gender Minority Populations, this project “Health, Stress, and Tobacco Use Disparities among Sexual Minority Populations” proposes to use an existing nationally representative dataset to assess the relationships among sexual orientation, discrimination, stress, tobacco/nicotine use behaviors, and DSM-5 tobacco use disorder in the U.S. Tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of death; cigarette smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year in the U.S. Past research has generally found sexual minorities are at heightened risk for cigarette smoking and other tobacco/nicotine use. However, many of these studies are plagued by methodological limitations including small, non-representative samples, lack of heterosexual comparison groups and/or limited sexual orientation measures. To date, no nationally representative studies have examined the DSM-5 tobacco use disorder disparities among sexual minorities and few data exists on severity, comorbidity, disability, help seeking, and recovery associated with DSM-5 tobacco use disorder among sexual minorities. Thus, we propose to build on our prior work and conduct secondary analyses of the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC-III), a nationally representative survey of 36,309 U.S. adults 18 years and older in the U.S. The NESARC-III study represents the only nationally representative study that has sufficient measures and sample size to test for potential age, gender, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic status differences and to meet the objectives of our study, which aims to: (1) examine the prevalence of (a) cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use, and other tobacco/nicotine use, (b) DSM-5 tobacco use disorder severity (includes tobacco and/or nicotine products), and (c) comorbidity of DSM-5 tobacco use disorder and mental health disorders based on major dimensions of sexual orientation (attraction, behavior, and identity); (2) assess the disability (e.g., general health, physical functioning, and social functioning), help seeking (e.g., counseling, nicotine replacement therapy, and medication), and recovery (e.g., early and sustained remission) associated with tobacco/nicotine use and DSM-5 tobacco use disorder based on sexual orientation; and (3) determine the relationships among stressful events, sexual orientation discrimination (individual-level and institutional-level), tobacco/nicotine use and DSM-5 tobacco use disorder based on the Comprehensive Developmental and Minority Stress Model. This project will take advantage of the unique opportunities afforded by the 2012-2013 NESARC-III: the availability of an ethnically / racially diverse sample with large numbers of sexual minorities; the inclusion of multiple measures of sexual orientation based on attraction, behavior and identity; and the wealth of data on cigarette smoking, other tobacco/nicotine use, DSM-5 tobacco use disorder, and DSM-5 mental health disorders. Measures of stressful life events and sexual orientation discrimination will enable assessment of two of the major factors presumed to account for health disparities among sexual minorities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Findings from this project will enhance our understanding of tobacco-related health disparities among sexual minorities in the United States. Understanding prevalence, risk factors, resilience factors, severity, disability, help seeking and recovery associated with DSM-5 tobacco use disorder across sub-groups based on multiple dimensions of sexual orientation is critical for addressing health disparities and designing effective public health prevention and intervention efforts. This project examines new research questions related to tobacco/nicotine use across dimensions of sexual orientation, as well as potential mechanisms underlying tobacco-related health disparities among sexual minorities with a focus on stress, individual-level and institutional-level sexual orientation discrimination.","Health, Stress, and Tobacco Use Disparities among Sexual Minority Populations",9380175,R01CA212517,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Cause of Death ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Health ', ' Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' Nicotine ', ' Peer Review ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Stress ', ' Stressful Event ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Tobacco Use Disorder ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Family member ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' disability ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Physical Function ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Disease remission ', ' Remission ', ' Manuscripts ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Prevention ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' smoke cigarette ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' DSM-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' DSM5 ', ' DSM-5 ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' comparison group ', ' Social Functioning ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' sexual minority ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' Electronic cigarette ', ' e-cigarette ', ' e-cig ', ' environmental tobacco smoke exposure ', ' secondhand smoke exposure ', ' second hand smoke exposure ', ' exposure to tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to cigarette smoke ', ' exposure to SHS ', ' exposure to ETS ', ' cigarette smoke exposure ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,294632,-0.024117336045751423
"Young and Healthy Transwomen Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  U01 - Cohort Study with Young Men of Color who have Sex with Men In this fourth decade of the HIV epidemic, we continue to see 50,000 new infections annually in the U.S., particularly among Black/African American and Latino young men who have sex with men (YMSM of color), who now account for 60% of new infections among Black/African American MSM and 45% of new infections among Latino MSM. Black/African American YMSM remain five times more likely to be HIV seropositive, seven times more likely to have an undiagnosed HIV infection, and 45% more likely to be diagnosed with an STI than other YMSM. YMSM of color are also the least likely to seek and remain in HIV/AIDS care, and when they do seek care, they typically already have advanced HIV disease. Among youth who initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART), 54% will achieve viral suppression; unfortunately 57% will not be retained in care and less than 6% will remain virally suppressed. Changing the course of this epidemic is going to require a dramatically different approach to prevention. We are therefore proposing to conduct longitudinal research with a large and diverse cohort of 450 YMSM of color in order to prevent new HIV infections, reduce transmission, and reduce HIV/AIDS-related disparities by focusing on successful engagement in care. Building on the HIV Continuum of Care and Prevention paradigm (i.e., seek, test, treat, and retain in care) and the Syndemic Theory of Risk, we will use a mixed-methods study design to collect and analytically triangulate quantitative, qualitative, and biological measures at baseline and every six months. Participants will be recruited from public venues, HIV test sites, and HIV/AIDS clinics using randomized probability and purposeful sampling designs. All participants will be tracked to ensure a retention rate of 90% or better, which is a feasible target given our retention rates of 94% in the Healthy Young Men's (HYM) Study. The specific aims are to 1) better understand and operationally define what linkage, engagement, retention to care (both primary health and HIV/AIDS treatment) and adherence means to HIV- and HIV+ YMSM of color; 2) characterize and monitor over time YMSM of color's use of alcohol and illicit drugs; utilization of HIV testing and prevention services; incidence of HIV and STIs; insurance status and access to health care services, including primary care and HIV/AIDS treatment services; engagement in and utilization of health care and HIV/AIDS treatment services; retention in HIV/AIDS care and adherence to ART; and utilization of biomedical interventions, such as PrEP and PEP; and 3) identify barriers/facilitator of engagement along the HIV Continuum of Care and Prevention. The proposed research builds on close to two decades of NIH-funded research by our team focused on this and other high-risk youth populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is an urgent need to address increasing rates of HIV/AIDS among high-risk Black, Latino and multiracial young men who have sex with men in Los Angeles.

"Effect of Sex Hormones on HIV persistence ABSTRACT. Problem. There are distinct sex-based differences that affect the natural history of HIV infection and HIV- specific immune responses. These differences are partially driven by sex hormones (estrogens in particular) and might influence the size, distribution and transcriptional activity of the HIV reservoirs. Unfortunately, cis- gender women represent only 11% of all participants recruited to HIV cure research and there is a significant knowledge gap between the biology of HIV cure in men and women. Even less is known about the effect of exogenous sex hormones on the viral reservoir and immune response in HIV-infected transgender women. What we know now. One study including >500 HIV-infected participants on antiretroviral therapy (ART) found that women have on average significantly lower levels of HIV DNA in peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMC) than men. Various in vitro studies reported sex-based differences on HIV infection and replication in target cells. These differences are partially driven by estrogens that inhibit HIV transcription, through estrogen receptor-dependent mechanisms. Our proposed solution. We will prospectively enroll 15 HIV-infected transgender women (“male-to-female”) on ART with suppressed HIV RNA for >12 months, who plan to start estradiol-based hormonal therapy (HT). We will follow this cohort for 12 months. We will collect longitudinal blood samples before and after initiation of HT. We are uniquely positioned to recruit this “hard-to-reach” population thanks to our collaboration with “The Night Clinic” in San Diego, which is following >400 unique transgender women, 40% of whom are HIV-positive. Our goal. We will characterised extensively the HIV reservoir and generate immunological data at each time- point. We will use these data to determine the effect of sex hormones and receptor expression (in particular estradiol) on the HIV reservoir size and transcriptional activity over 12 months of follow-up while on suppressive ART. Historical data from a similar cohort of HIV-infected men (matched by baseline HIV DNA levels, age, CD4+ cells, time on ART and duration of HIV infection) will be used as a comparison. How will we advance the field. Transgender women are disproportionately impacted by HIV in the United States and worldwide and face overwhelming disparities. There is urgent need to include transgender women in the HIV cure agenda, and to adapt curative approaches to meet the unique needs of this specific population. Investigating the effect of estradiol-based HT on the HIV reservoir size and transcriptional activity in transgender women will provide the unique opportunity to the isolate the effect of estradiol on HIV transcription. Narrative There are distinct sex-based differences that affect the natural history and immune pathogenesis of HIV infection. These factors likely impact the establishment, distribution and transcriptional activity of the HIV reservoir. Our study is designed to determine the effect of sex hormones and receptor expression on the HIV reservoir size and transcriptional activity during suppressive antiretroviral therapy in transgender women starting estradiol-based hormonal therapy.",Effect of Sex Hormones on HIV persistence,9410682,R21AI134295,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Androgens ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Distributional Activity ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' DNA ', ' ELISA ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estradiol ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogens ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Female ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' Goals ', ' HDAC Proteins ', ' HDAC ', ' Histone Deacetylase ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Hormone Receptor ', ' In Vitro ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Progesterone ', ' Therapeutic Progesterone ', ' Pregnenedione ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione ', ' Delta4-pregnene-3,20-dione ', ' Corpus Luteum Hormone ', ' Prolactin ', ' luteotropin ', ' luteotropic hormone ', ' Pituitary Mammotropic Hormone ', ' Pituitary Lactogenic Hormone ', ' Mammotropin ', ' Estrogen Receptors ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' sex steroid ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' helper T cell ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4+ T cell ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Testosterone ', ' Trans-Testosterone ', ' Therapeutic Testosterone ', ' Time ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Upregulation ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' virology ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Mediating ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Clinic ', ' therapy duration ', ' Viral ', ' receptor expression ', ' cohort ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' PBMC ', ' Vorinostat ', ' suberanilohydroxamic acid ', ' Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid ', ' SAHA ', ' Participant ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' Data ', ' Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor ', ' Histone deacetylase inhibition ', ' HDAC inhibitor ', ' HDAC Agent ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' T cell response ', ' transgender women ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' Viral reservoir ', ' Virus reservoir ', ' cisgender ', ' disenfranchised population ', ' disenfranchised group ', ' ']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2017,232500,-0.017219579247197272
"Dissemination, Implementation,and Evaluation of Native Stand in AI Communities PROJECT SUMMARY Given the growing diversity of populations in the United States, communicating effectively is a key element of sexual health promotion to teens in communities where disparities exist, particularly among African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN), and sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth. Disparities in sexual health outcomes suggest that these subgroups may not be receiving sufficient health information, or that messages are not perceived as relevant or understandable, impeding healthy decision-making. Understanding common and unique aspects of values, beliefs, and language should allow the crafting of messages, strategies, and steps to improve communication and contextualize sexual health promotion messages at individual and community levels. Our research will determine the preferred messages, messengers, and communication channels relevant to teens for the specific topics of abstinence, consistent and correct use of condoms, and STI/HIV testing. In response to the requested objectives in SIP 17-006, our research aims are to: (1) Conduct a literature review of barriers, facilitators, and current STI/HIV and pregnancy prevention messages and messaging channels for adolescents by race/ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity; (2) Conduct focus groups/interviews with African American, Hispanic/Latino, AI/AN, and SGM youth on messages, sources, and channels; (3) Conduct a Delphi survey of experts to achieve consensus on the findings of the literature review and focus groups; and (4) Conduct a second round of focus groups with a larger and broader sample of youth, to revise and finalize specific theory- and evidence-based recommendations for sexual health messaging to that meets the diversity of the adolescent population. Combining our understanding from youth (the constituent stakeholders) with input from topical experts will ensure the development of a set of recommendations that are both practical and based on evidence for acceptability and efficacy. The ultimate product will be a library of messages and strategies (including written, printed and oral sexual health messages), as well as messages delivered via mass media and multimedia technologies, organized by middle and high school age, gender, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation and gender identity. Our approach builds upon existing collaborations and access to diverse communities, and our extensive experience as a team in adolescent sexual health promotion. It is innovative because it not only seeks to identify effective messaging in sexual health promotion, but also cultural factors influencing effectiveness. PROJECT NARRATIVE Disparities in sexual health outcomes among youth of minority and underserved groups suggest that these teens may not be receiving sufficient health information, or that they do not perceive the messages are not as relevant or understandable. This project will combine information from the scientific literature, experts, and youth themselves to create a set of messages that would likely lead to increases in abstinence, using condoms consistently and correctly, and seeking testing for sexual health services, such as STI/HIV testing. To facilitate their use in program planning, the messages will be organized by middle and high school age groups, gender, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation and gender identity.  ","Dissemination, Implementation,and Evaluation of Native Stand in AI Communities",9440019,U48DP005006,[''],NCCDPHP,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U48,2017,399093,0.002346165837836551
"Effects of Marriage Recognition on Substance Abuse and Health for Women Project Summary/Abstract Sexual minority women (SMW; lesbian, bisexual) experience substantial health disparities, including significantly higher rates of hazardous drinking, depression, and poor self-reported health compared to heterosexual women. However, there is a dearth of research examining resiliency factors and how these factors might vary by race/ethnicity among SMW. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) challenged researchers to examine factors that foster resilience among SMW including examining differences by race and ethnicity and exploring the positive impact on sexual minority (SM) health of the legal recognition of same-sex marriage. Studies have found strong associations between supportive policies, such as marriage recognition, and improved health outcomes among sexual minorities. However, there are gaps in understanding specific psycho-social factors may explain the impact of policies on SM health outcomes. To address these gaps in knowledge, we will draw on minority stress, intersectionality, and social-ecological frameworks and a mixed-methods research design to identify and assess factors that underlie the effect of marriage recognition on health and to examine relationships between these factors and three health outcomes among SMW: hazardous drinking, depression, and poor general health. Several key innovations ensure the success and high impact of this project. First, the proposed project leverages innovative methods from a currently funded project (R01 DA036606; Drabble & Trocki, multiple-PIs), which uses respondent-driven sampling (RDS) based on population-based ""seeds"" from the National Alcohol Survey (NAS) to collect data nationwide from a large and diverse population of approximately 1000 SMW. Second, by creating measures to describe how marriage recognition may influence health, our study contributes to the sparse but urgently needed research on resiliency among SMW. Third, the study contributes to emerging understanding of the impact of marriage recognition on health outcomes, with a special focus on differences in risk by race/ethnicity and how such risks may be attenuated by other risk/protective factors at individual, interpersonal, community, and sociopolitical levels. Finally, the study capitalizes on the recent historic national change in laws that now recognize same-sex marriage in all states, affording a timely opportunity to develop and test new scales designed to investigate how marriage recognition influences health outcomes among racially and ethnically diverse SMW. To do so, we will test the following aims: 1) Develop new measures to assess factors that underlie the impact of marriage recognition, using in-depth qualitative interviews with approximately 32 diverse SMW. 2) Assess the psychometric properties of the new measures among approximately 500-600 SMW, using item analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. 3) Examine the predictive value of these novel SMW-specific measures on hazardous drinking, depression and self-reported health, with specific focus on racial/ethnic differences. We will merge new data with previously collected data, which include rich demographic, risk and resiliency data from the same participants. Findings will be used in future studies with population-based and volunteer samples to inform prevention and intervention strategies aimed and building resiliency and reducing health disparities among SMW. Project Narrative We expect that the proposed research will substantially move forward the fields of women's health and substance use. Specifically, findings from studies using new measures will add significantly to the currently sparse knowledge about individual, interpersonal, and societal factors that contribute to health disparities among women, including differences by race/ethnicity and sexual identity. Such knowledge will support the development of culturally appropriate prevention and intervention strategies, as well as policies to reduce health disparities among women.",Effects of Marriage Recognition on Substance Abuse and Health for Women,9456502,R03MD011481,"['Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Employment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Housing ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Laws ', ' Marriage ', ' Methods ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Seeds ', ' seed ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' Lesbian ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Respondent ', ' Attenuated ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' psychological distress ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Legal ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Marriage and Family ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' Societal Factors ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' minority health ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' volunteer ', ' population based ', ' hazardous drinking ', ' sexual minority ', ' same-sex marriage ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' ethnic identity ', ' intersectionality ', ' ']",NIMHD,PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE,R03,2017,74761,-0.029182751813423714
"Health Effects of Identity-based Stressors Among Men Project Summary Health disparities among sexual and gender minority people exist across the lifespan, and are increasingly well-documented, yet gaps remain in our basic understanding of how health varies within these groups. This was emphasized in the Institute of Medicine's 2011 report on LGBT health, which pointed specifically to the need for more research among bisexual populations. While bisexual men experience notable health disparities related to both outcomes and access to care, we know very little about the unique risk factors that bisexual- identified men experience. The minority stress model posits that minority groups face stressors associated with their minority status that are unique and additive to everyday life stressors. The majority of work related to sexual minority stressors and health has presumed that experiences of lesbian, gay and bisexual groups are the same. Additionally, there is little work assessing the health effects of daily-level, identity-based stressors and health among SGM populations. The proposed study will address these gaps in the literature, using a novel, multi-method approach. Through qualitative interviews, use of daily electronic diaries over 28 consecutive days, and survey measures, we will test the hypothesis that racially diverse bisexual men who more frequently report microaggressions will have poorer mental and physical health outcomes than bisexual men who less frequently report microaggressions. Aims are: 1)Identify the characteristics of racially diverse bisexual men's microaggressive experiences, e.g., context, content and source, including their responses to such experiences; 2) Determine the frequency and source of sexual orientation and racial/ethnic microaggressions among bisexual men and test their association(s) with daily mental and physical health; 3) Assess lifetime stressors that may influence associations between MAs and daily and lifetime mental and physical health. This study is a companion to a similar study among bisexual women, and will allow for cross- gender comparisons. This preliminary exploration of within-group differences can significantly advance our knowledge of the risk factors associated with health disparities among racially diverse bisexual men. Findings will be critical for informing directions for future research and practice through the identification of relevant research questions and/or foci for preventative interventions. Project Narrative Bisexual men experience numerous health disparities in comparison to other men, related to both mental and physical health, as well as access to care. These inequities create a public health burden through both their economic, as well as social, costs. This project will identify potential risk factors unique to racially/ethnically diverse bisexual men, and assist in determining the focus for future intervention and prevention programming.",Health Effects of Identity-based Stressors Among Men,9428586,R21MD012319,"['Affect ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Life Experience ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' Latino ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Caring ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Companions ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' care seeking ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' deprivation ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' sexual minority ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R21,2017,254090,0.0803245836850783
"Creating a Tailored Lifestyle Intervention for Midlife Mexican American Men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Midlife (45-64 yr) Mexican-American (MA) men are susceptible to future burden from cardio metabolic diseases because of numerous factors, most notably less healthful dietary and physical activity (PA) behaviors coupled with low participation in chronic disease prevention and management efforts. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand how to promote health-enhancing diet and PA behaviors in this understudied group of the population. The objective of this application is to use a mixed-methods approach to inform the development of and pilot test a gendered- and culturally-tailored diet- and PA intervention for cardiometabolic disease prevention among midlife MA men. This objective will be attained by addressing the following specific aims: (1) conduct qualitative research with midlife MA men and their significant others (e.g. spouse, partner, close family member), and key informants (stakeholders from the MA community) to identify: (a) knowledge, perceptions, and behaviors regarding what constitutes healthful diet and PA practices; (b) perceived barriers and enablers of dietary and PA behavior change, (c) proposed strategies to promote dietary and PA behavior change, (d) perceived resources and assets for implementing dietary and PA behavior change interventions, and (e) masculine, cultural, and social identities that interact to influence interet and engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors; and (2) assess the initial efficacy, feasibility and acceptability of a gender-tailored and culturally-relevant diet and PA behavior change pilot intervention targeting midlife MA men. Phase I of the project will entail focus groups to identify determinants of midlife MA men's health behaviors, existing good practices and health- promoting values and behaviors, and acceptable intervention strategies. The proposed project will use intersectionality, which examines how the blending of identities and experiences create more accurate reflection of the determinants of men's health behaviors, within the context of the sociocultural determinants of health, as the conceptual framework. A ""grassroots"" approach will also explore beliefs, barriers and enablers to dietary and PA change identified by significant others and community stakeholders Information collected during Phase I will inform the development of intervention materials and processes that will be pilot-tested during Phase II. Phase II will consist of a randomized controlled trial to test the initial efficacy, feasibility an acceptability of a gender-tailored, culturally relevant dietary and PA intervention targeting midlie MA men. Innovation lies in our study being the first to apply an intersectional approach in health disparities research with midlife MA men, a severely understudied and high-risk subgroup. To date, no interventions have been developed or adequately tailored to address issues unique to MA men 45-64 yr. Thus, the proposed research is significant be- cause it addresses a critical gap and will inform the development of lifestyle-based interventions targeting mid- life MA men. The proposed project will also establish the foundation for a subsequent test of intervention efficacy, as well as future translation and dissemination in varied community settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will use a mixed-methods approach to develop and pilot-test a gender-tailored and culturally- relevant diet and physical activity intervention targeting midlife Mexican-American men. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will be the first in a series of studies designed to develop feasible and acceptable health promotion strategies among Mexican-American men, an understudied and vulnerable group of the population.

"National Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center for African American Men's Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The National Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center for African American Men's Health (NTCC), proposed by the University of Minnesota (UMN) in partnership with the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), seeks to address, through a regional approach, health disparities in conditions affecting African American men on a national scope. The program will target disparities in unintentional and violence-related injuries and chronic diseases in African American men across the life course of this population. The proposed NTCC is built upon the framework of an existing national consortium - the Enhancing Minority Participation in Clinical Trials (EMPaCT) - and will utilize the established infrastructure of the five major EMPaCT centers: UMN (Midwest), UAB (Southeast), Johns Hopkins University (East), MD Anderson Cancer Center (Southwest), and the University of California, Davis (West).The goal is to develop, implement, and evaluate interventions that will improve African American men's health through research, outreach, and training. This goal will be pursued through the broad partnership and significant collaboration with our national supporters, the National Baptist Convention Foundation USA, Inc. , the National Football League , and 100 Black Men of America, Inc. To achieve our goal, we will implement the following specific aims: Aim 1. Conduct a one-year planning and assessment phase. Aim 2. Develop, implement, and evaluate a collaborative research program in the core areas of differential health outcomes for African American men: unintentional and violence -related injuries, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and stroke; Aim 3. Establish four cores (Administrative, Collaborations and Partnerships, Research, and Intervention Implementation/Diffusion) to support the proposed and future research activities; Aim 4. Develop, implement, and evaluate a Pilot Project Program in collaboration with national community-based partners and in conjunction with EMPaCT Consortium members;Aim 5. Disseminate research results and promote research uptake through an integrated approach that uses both traditional and social media in order to engage stakeholders at all levels. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The National Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center for African American Men's Health will focus on the social, economic, biologic and behavioral determinants of morbidity and premature mortality among African American men across the life course and will develop academic-community collaborative strategies and interventions to coordinate and integrate the fragmented efforts for men's health awareness, disease management, intervention and research at regional, state, and local levels.",National Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center for African American Men's Health,9303788,U54MD008620,"['Affect ', ' Alabama ', ' Americas ', ' Awareness ', ' California ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diffusion ', ' Economics ', ' Football ', ' Manufactured football ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Minnesota ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Universities ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Research Activity ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' Baptist Church ', ' Baptists ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' programs ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' male health ', "" men's health "", ' public health relevance ', ' Minority Participation ', ' social media ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U54,2017,5843293,0.056104962501769794
"Cancer-Health Disparities in Incarcerated Men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this NCI K22 career development proposal is to develop the PI, a PhD, and trained social worker in health disparities, into a successfully funded independent cancer researcher. The proposal contains both career development and structured research plan activities focus on advancing cancer-health disparities research with incarcerated men. Incarcerated men have not generally been the focus of cancer health studies although multiple reports indicate that approximately 60-80% of inmates in the United States have histories of tobacco use, compared to 30% of the general population, and over 80% of individuals involved in the criminal justice system report histories of substance use, including alcohol, marijuana and crack cocaine. This is an alarming statistic, considering that tobacco, marijuana, crack cocaine, and alcohol use are associated with an increased risk of developing lung and liver diseases and certain cancers. Little is known about incarcerated men's cancer-health disparities and how incarceration affects their health behaviors upon release to the community. This program builds upon the PI's prior work including her strong background in HIV/AIDS research, clinical practice, and mixed-methods research experience. The specific career goals are: (1) to become proficient in research skills, focusing on advanced quantitative methods, data analysis and grant writing (enroll in cancer epidemiology and longitudinal research courses); and (2) to gain experience in prison cancer-health disparities research (collecting primary cancer- health disparities data across three different correctional facilities). The proposed research will assess the cancer-health disparities and smoking behaviors of men ages 18 years and over who are currently incarcerated in facilities of three different security levels (i.e., detention, minimum, and medium). The specific aims are to: (1) assess the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about cancer and describe the smoking behaviors of incarcerated men; and (2) adapt the Cancer 101 (a cancer education resource to improve cancer knowledge, survival rates and cancer control in vulnerable populations) for incarcerated men in three different correctional settings. The results from the K22 described in this proposal are intended to inform the basis of a NCI R01 grant application. The long-term goal is to design and implement a culturally appropriate prison-to-community cancer-health prevention trial for incarcerated men returning to their communities in order to ultimately reduce the cancer burden affecting men with criminal justice backgrounds. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer-related disparities are not well understood as they apply to incarcerated populations. The proposed award explores cancer health and cancer education in men who are incarcerated.

"Parenting and Men's Health: The Utility of the Fathers and Sons Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the public health significance of problems such as substance abuse and depression among African American men, few evidence-based prevention strategies have been developed for these men and even fewer have focused on a strategy that uses their role as a father as a protection against poor health outcomes. This application proposes to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the Fathers and Sons Program for reducing depression and drinking behavior and increasing substance use and mental health service utilization among nonresident African American fathers. It focuses on enhancing fathers' parenting knowledge, attitudes and behaviors, connectedness with their sons, and awareness and use of community resources. This theoretically-based, gender-specific, culturally relevant, family-centered program was originally designed to enhance parenting attitudes and behaviors among nonresident African American fathers and strengthen their relationship with their preadolescent sons as a way to prevent youth risky behaviors. It was developed using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to increase its relevance and appeal to the intended audiences. Preliminary evidence suggests the program is promising for improving health behaviors and well-being among fathers as well. Our goal is to conduct a randomized control trial to evaluate the program for its long-term health benefits for both fathers and sons. The results of the original Fathers and Sons intervention program will be compared to a control group that will receive a family-based program focused on physical activity and nutrition. Because fathers and sons participate in the Fathers and Sons programs together, we will have the added benefit of examining how influencing father's parenting attitudes and behaviors affect their sons' health behaviors, offering intergenerational perspectives on men's health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application proposes to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the Fathers and Sons Program for reducing depression and drinking behavior, and increasing service use among nonresident African American fathers with preadolescent sons. Specifically, it focuses on enhancing fathers' parenting knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, connectedness with their sons, and awareness and use of community resources as strategies for improving their health.

"Effects of Acute Alcohol on Sex-Specific Delay Discounting and Subsequent Sexual Decision Making among MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K08 research and training award will enable the PI to develop skills as an independent clinical scientist using advanced research methodology to ultimately (a) uncover new mechanisms of action underlying the association between acute alcohol and risky sexual behavior among men who have sex with men (MSM), and (b) use that knowledge to refine preventative interventions targeting alcohol-related HIV-risk behavior within this high-priority population.. Preliminary findings suggest that domain-general impulsive delay discounting is associated with sexual risk-taking in the context of co-occurring alcohol use. Measures of SSDD tend to outperform domain-general discounting measures in terms of strength of association with risky sexual behavior. The proposed project would be the first to examine the causal effects of acute alcohol on SSDD, and subsequent effects on sexual decision making among MSM. Formative research (Phase 1) will involve qualitative exploration of men's personal experience of sexual impulsivity, as well as qualitative feedback to adapt and refine our experimental paradigm to match the target population. Pilot research (Phase 2) will be conducted to bridge the formative phase and full experimental investigation (Phase 3). Adult MSM who are single, sexually active, and engage in heavy drinking will be recruited from the local community to participate in the qualitative focus groups (Phase 1; N=30-48), pilot testing of experimental protocol (Phase 2; N=12), and the full experimental trial (Phase 3; N=180). The full single-session experiment will employ an alcohol/placebo/nonalcohol design with random assignment to one of three conditions (i.e., alcohol at 0.8g/kg dose, placebo, and true control) to examine the acute effects of alcohol (i.e., both pharmacological and expectancy) on SSDD, and the subsequent effects on risky sexual decision making (i.e., intention to engage in unprotected anal intercourse). This research will lead to subsequent grant applications to (a) extend this line of human laboratory research, and (b) develop a behavioral economic supplement to brief preventative intervention targeting alcohol-related HIV risk behavior. The PI will work with a highly skilled mentorship team (Drs. Peter Monti, Don Operario, James MacKillop, James Murphy, and David Jarmolowicz) to build four areas of expertise relevant to this research agenda: 1) experimental and qualitative research methodology; 2) behavioral economics of sexual decision making; 3) health disparities in MSM populations; and 4) preventative intervention, with specific emphasis on HIV risk behavior. This K08 proposal addresses a key priority in national public health, and the science of alcohol- related HIV-risk behavior, and will fully prepare the PI for an independent research career in clinical science. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Men who have sex with men (MSM) bear the heaviest burden of the HIV epidemic in the United States, and the transmission rate in this population is rising. This project will contribute to a greater understanding of how alcohol influences impulsive decision making and sexual risk taking among MSM. This information will guide the development of new preventative interventions targeting heavy drinking and sexual impulsivity as a means to reduce alcohol-related sexual risk taking and HIV transmission in this high risk and underserved population.",Effects of Acute Alcohol on Sex-Specific Delay Discounting and Subsequent Sexual Decision Making among MSM,9228303,K08AA024056,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Anal ', ' Anus ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Epidemic ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Perception ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Placebo Effect ', ' placebo response ', ' nocebo ', ' expectation effect ', ' expectancy effect ', ' Placebos ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' sexually active ', ' Glare ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' interest ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' experience ', ' alcohol effect ', ' ethanol effect ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Heavy Drinking ', ' heavy alcohol use ', ' extreme drinking ', ' excessive ethanol ingestion ', ' excessive drinking ', ' excessive alcohol intake ', ' excessive alcohol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol consumption ', ' excess ethanol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol consumption ', ' drink heavily ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' HIV risk ', ' risk perception ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Cognitive ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' discount ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' discounting ', ' Expectancy ', ' Population ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' alcohol risk ', ' sexual risk taking ', ' behavioral economics ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIAAA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,K08,2017,195480,-0.0004441128830592319
"Methods for Estimating Sex Differences in Safety and Effectiveness of Drugs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Recent evidence suggests women, in comparison to men, experience greater CVD related mortality, may have inferior responses to treatment, and are at greater risk of adverse drug events. However, from drug development to safety, tolerability and efficacy testing, insufficient attention has been given to sex differencesin patient responses to pharmacologic agents. Moreover, randomized controlled trials, even large multicenter studies, are generally underpowered to detect heterogeneity in efficacy or safety, including any existing sex differences. Our preliminary results further suggest that standard analytic approaches for assessing sex differences in non-experimental research may lead to estimated sex-specific treatment effects that are biased. Therefore, our overall objectives are to develop, test, implement, and disseminate reliable and innovative methods for evaluating sex differences in the comparative effectiveness and safety of CVD pharmacotherapy. Our specific aims are to: 1) identify conditions under which common analytic methods are likely to produce biased estimates of treatment effects in men and/or women; 2) develop innovative alternative analytic methods that validly and reliably evaluate sex differences; 3) test the performance of these innovative methods and the standard analytic approaches in a large scale Monte Carlo simulation study; and 4) apply and validate methods for quantifying sex differences in the safety and effectiveness of pharmacotherapy. We will use national administrative claims data supplemented by survey and laboratory data enabling us to deliver timely answers to these urgent clinical questions with immediate implications for clinical practice. Moreover, the innovative and novel analytic methods we will develop and implement in this proposal will be applicable broadly to the study of other important patient subgroups (such as those defined by race, ethnicity and age), and will be equally relevant across the full spectrum of health conditions and their clinical management. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The findings will impact health and health care by informing risks, benefits, and sex differences in the effects of lipid lowering drugs - currently used by nearly 20 million Americans. By using national administrative claims databases supplemented by rich laboratory and survey data, we leverage our existing resources and deliver timely answers to urgent clinical questions with immediate implications at the bedside. The innovative methods we will develop have application to other subgroups (e.g., minorities, children), and will be equally relevant across the spectrum of clinical concerns from infectious agents to medical devices. In the emerging era of personalized medicine, it is essential that our analytic methods are honed and chosen carefully for the important challenges that face researchers and the stakeholders who rely on their findings.",Methods for Estimating Sex Differences in Safety and Effectiveness of Drugs,9265923,R01HL118255,"['Accounting ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Attention ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' cardiovascular disorder diagnosis ', ' cardiovascular disease diagnosis ', ' Cardiovascular Diagnostic Technics ', ' Cardiovascular Diagnostic Techniques ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lipids ', ' Medical Device ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Monte Carlo Method ', ' Monte Carlo simulation ', ' Monte Carlo procedure ', ' Monte Carlo calculation ', ' Monte Carlo algorithm ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' pharmacoepidemiological ', ' pharmacoepidemiologic ', ' drug epidemiology ', ' Pharmaceutical Epidemiology ', ' Pharmacoepidemiology ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Infectious Agent ', ' infectious organism ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Inferior ', ' American ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' experience ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' drug development ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' therapeutic outcome ', ' therapy outcome ', ' sex ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' treatment effect ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' efficacy testing ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' Adverse drug event ', ' minority children ', ' sex disparity ', ' disparities in sex ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,359174,-0.024701924825663794
"Sexual Orientation/Gender Identity, Socioeconomic Status, and Health across the Life Course Abstract Socioeconomic status (SES) is a fundamental contributor to health and disease across the life course. Inequalities in health that disfavor sexual and gender minorities have been widely documented in both adolescence and adulthood. Despite the importance of SES to health, knowledge about factors that pattern these resources and strains across sexual and gender minority groups is incomplete, largely because of the absence of appropriate and high quality data, as well as study design limitations for data that do exist. In synchrony with the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) Wave V program project design and activity, this proposed ancillary project will collect, clean, disseminate, and analyze new data from a subset of the Add Health cohort (sexual minorities, transgendered individuals, and a comparison sample of heterosexuals) via a theory-guided ancillary survey that will add information about formative experiences more specific to sexual orientation and gender development, and enhance existing prospective information about SES and determinants of SES. Based on Wave IV data we plan to recruit approximately 2,200 self-identified sexual/gender minorities and a random comparison sample of 1,500 heterosexuals. The unique data collected via this project will provide an unprecedented opportunity for new and current Add Health users to prospectively study the intersections of sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic factors, and health in a population-based sample across the life course at only marginal cost. Positioned within a life course framework and guided by Minority Stress Theory, we will also address three substantive analytical aims using the released ancillary data: 1) to describe the timing and sequence of theoretical milestones in the development of sexual orientation and gender identity; 2) to examine potential mediators (i.e., parent-child relationship quality and subsequent adolescent educational attainment and housing status) of the association between sexual orientation, gender identity, and young adult SES; and 3) to test a hypothesized pathway that economic strain heightens stress, which in turn elevates depressive symptoms. Findings made possible through these new data, in combination with existing longitudinal information about Add Health sample members, have the potential for critical impact on public health policy and intervention strategies to reduce the prevalence of and disparities in disease burden for the sexual and gender minority population. Project Narrative Despite the importance of socioeconomic status to health and documented health inequalities that disfavor sexual and gender minorities, knowledge about factors that pattern these resources and strains across sexual and gender minority groups is incomplete, largely because of the absence of appropriate and high quality data. This cost effective project will build on the population-based National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health by collecting and disseminating data to address these critical knowledge gaps and by testing hypotheses linking economic strain and health across the life course to inform public health policy and interventions.","Sexual Orientation/Gender Identity, Socioeconomic Status, and Health across the Life Course",9237689,R01HD087365,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Family ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Data Quality ', ' Inequality ', ' Re 80 ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' Respondent ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' health knowledge ', ' experience ', ' intergenerational ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Monitor ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' population based ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' health inequalities ', ' sexual minority ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' data resource ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,644139,0.02568274188127821
"Developing a Dyadic Intervention for STI/HIV Prevention in Youth ABSTRACT  While public health programs have demonstrated modest success in reducing the adolescent and young adult (AYA) risk for STI/HIV, significant health disparities remain. The risk of STI/HIV is not uniform among AYA. AYA residing in segregated urban communities with high STI prevalence and complicated sexual networks face even greater risk for disease and associated complications. Additional supports designed to increase engagement in care and reduce STI acquisition and transmissions are urgently needed to meet the sexual health and reproductive health goals for the nation. Overwhelmingly, AYA STI prevention interventions have targeted individuals and individual-level factors. While effective, these interventions do not adequately address other important influences affecting AYA risk for STI/HIV, such as partner or relationship influences on sexual decision-making and behavior. Partner notification and treatment is a key strategy for disease control and has previously been tested among adults for STI/HIV prevention work but has yet to be evaluated for AYA. Our prior research demonstrates that AYAs with complicated STIs are likely to notify their partners to seek treatment (88-92%); however, AYAs receiving brief behavioral interventions, relative to those receiving standard of care were 3 times more likely to be successful in arranging for their partner's treatment. Thus, partner interventions may hold promise for harnessing the power of relationship dynamics to enhance sexual decision-making, communication, and subsequent health behaviors. We propose to pilot test an intervention designed to change sexual health outcomes by understanding partners and the learning environment related to sex [COUPLES] by simultaneously delivering two evidence-based STI/HIV prevention interventions Sister- to-Sister Teen and Focus on the Future. The simultaneous delivery of effective interventions will be augmented with a joint partner health education counseling session focused on enhancing communication and negotiation of safe sexual practices within the relationship. If successful, this pilot will support the development of a larger trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in the busy primary care setting by providing evidence that AYA can and will safely engage their partners in a supportive primary care setting that integrates high quality treatment with evidence-based STI/HIV prevention interventions delivered by health educator teams. PROJECT NARRARTIVE Sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention strategies for adolescents and young adults (AYA) primarily rely on individual approaches leaving sexual partners with significant unmet sexual and reproductive health needs. Failure to engage AYA partners results in complicated STIs, continued spread of infection, increased risk for HIV acquisition, and index partner reinfection. This pilot project will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of a dyad-based behavioral intervention [COUPLES] that augments individual evidence-based interventions with joint health education counseling for STI-affected AYA dyads within a primary care setting.",Developing a Dyadic Intervention for STI/HIV Prevention in Youth,9392727,R21HD090498,"['adolescence

"Intimate Partner Violence in Sexual Minority Female Adolescents and Young Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young female sexual minorities (YFSM) are at exceptionally high risk for intimate partner violence (IPV), with over half of YFSM reporting physical or sexual abuse by a dating partner. These young IPV victims may be particularly vulnerable to the negative physical and mental health consequences of IPV, including substance abuse, depression, and suicide, due to minority stress and diminished protective resources (e.g., parent support, community connectedness). In addition, YFSM may be less likely to report and to seek or receive help for IPV because they are not ""out"" about their sexual orientation or they fear stigmatization and discrimination. Women who seek help for same-sex IPV are often denied services (e.g., two-thirds of LGBT IPV survivors were denied access to domestic violence shelters) and feel marginalized and unsupported by domestic violence service systems. Basic research is clearly needed to inform development of culturally sensitive, evidence-based interventions to prevent IPV in YFSM and to support female sexual minority IPV victims. The existing literature, however, has almost exclusively focused on IPV in heterosexuals. Because LGBT teens and young adults face unique issues surrounding their relationships and sexual behaviors (e.g., pressures to deny or conceal sexual identity and activities), the risk and protective factors for IPV, help-seeking behaviors, and consequences of IPV in sexual minority youth are likely quite different from those observed in heterosexual youth. The overarching goal of this project is to begin to address these disparities by conducting an innovative study of IPV in female sexual minority adolescents and young adults (YFSM). We propose a novel, minority stress-informed dynamic developmental systems perspective of IPV in YFSM, which we will test using a mixed-methods, accelerated longitudinal design. Building upon the longest running study of LGBT youth, we will collect quantitative data from two ethnically diverse cohorts of YFSM (N= 530; ages 16-26) every six months for two years, as well as qualitative data from 50 selected participants. We will accomplish the overarching goal with four primary specific aims: (1) Describe the nature and trajectories of IPV in YFSM across adolescence and young adulthood; (2) Identify risk and protective factors for IPV among YFSM, including factors that differentiate violent vs. non-violent/healthy relationships; (3) Examine factors that affect YFSM's reporting of IPV, help-seeking for IPV, and ability to benefit from help provided (e.g., cultural competence of providers); and (4) Evaluate the consequences of IPV in YFSM, identifying factors that raise risk for or protect YFSM victims from revictimization and negative health consequences of IPV. Integration of the resulting quantitative and qualitative data will be used to inform the development of evidence-based interventions to prevent IPV among YFSM and better serve those who experience IPV. 1            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young female sexual minorities experience exceptionally high rates of Intimate partner violence (IPV) and may be particularly vulnerable to subsequent physical and mental health problems. The aims of this study are to describe IPV in female sexual minorities across adolescence and young adulthood, as well as to identify factors that raise risk for or protect against IPV, affect IPV victims' ability to receive appropriate help, and exacerbate or mitigate the negative health consequences of IPV. Data obtained from this project will inform the development of culturally sensitive interventions to reduce the rates of IPV and to better support IPV victims in this vulnerable population.        ",Intimate Partner Violence in Sexual Minority Female Adolescents and Young Adults,9272271,R01HD086170,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Buffers ', ' Communities ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' pressure ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Running ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Woman ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' Shelter facility ', ' Injury ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Area ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Domestic Violence ', ' Survivors ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' sexually abused ', ' sex abuse ', ' Sexual abuse ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' cultural competence ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Reporting ', ' emotional abuse ', ' mental abuse ', ' Psychological abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' teenage ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' sex ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' physical abuse ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' data modeling ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 21 year old ', ' twenty-one years of age ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' 21 years of age ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' revictimization ', ' longitudinal design ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobia ', ' Homophobic ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' same-sex couple ', ' same sex relationship ', ' same sex partner ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Same-sex ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' violence victimization ', ' violence perpetration ', ' prospective test ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,R01,2017,548417,0.01631227568850796
"Sexual Health Disparities in Young Women of Color: A PCMH Needs Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT BACKGROUND. Racial and ethnic disparities are pronounced in sexual and reproductive health outcomes. African American and Hispanic girls (young women of color), comprise 57% of all teen pregnancies1 and 79% of all new HIV infections2, although they represent only 26% of this population2. High rates of medical indigence, related to poverty in young women of color, limit access to quality sexual and reproductive health services3-4. Research has identified barriers that maintain health disparities in healthcare, in particular provider (e.g., lack of training and skills) and patient (e.g., perceived discrimination) level barriers as well as patient-provider communication barriers (e.g., discomfort with sexual health communication)5. The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) is a model of primary care that advocates for quality patient-centered care that is accessible, continuous, and comprehensive6-7. Over 50% of youth have medical homes, and those youth are less likely to have unmet needs and more likely to engage in preventative medical visits in primary care7, though little is known about sexual health care in this context. This model was designed to help underserved communities achieve health equity through culturally-responsive care8. For example, the PCMH model has built-in financial incentives for providers to decrease racial and ethnic health disparities, such as participation in learning collaboratives, including e-learning courses8-9. The PCMH model has already been effective at decreasing healthcare costs and health disparities10. Therefore, the PCMH model is an ideal vehicle by which to reduce the sexual and reproductive health disparities of young women of color. SPECIFIC AIMS. The purpose of the proposed project is to conduct a mixed-methods needs assessment with PCMH providers and young women of color to understand the needs and barriers to quality sexual and reproductive healthcare (on provider and patient levels). The knowledge gained will be used to create a detailed content outline, which will inform next-steps or the development of an e-learning course for time-limited healthcare providers to enhance cultural competency and progress towards health equity. METHODS. A sequential multilevel mixed-methods needs assessment will be conducted with providers and young women of color. The quantitative phase will include survey methods to quantify needs and barriers to quality sexual and reproductive healthcare and to identify major topics and themes to guide discussions during the qualitative phase. The qualitative phase will consist of in-depth individual interviews with physicians and iterative focus groups with young women of color to explore the meaning of these themes and how they may be addressed. During the integration phase, the quantitative and qualitative data will be integrated to create a detailed content outline for the e-learning course. LONG TERM GOAL. My long term goal is to develop a program of health services research focused on culturally-responsive healthcare interventions for youth to address health disparities of major significance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Young women of color are in need of high quality sexual and reproductive healthcare. The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) is a promising vehicle by which to reduce the sexual and reproductive health disparities of young women of color. A needs assessment with PCMH providers and young women of color will result in a comprehensive understanding of needs and barriers to quality healthcare services in this setting. This knowledge will also inform a grant application aimed at developing an e-learning course for time-limited healthcare providers to enhance cultural competence and progress towards health equity.",Sexual Health Disparities in Young Women of Color: A PCMH Needs Assessment,9314236,F32HS024854,[''],AHRQ,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,F32,2017,61194,0.027795819184768287
"Effects of Marriage Recognition on Substance Abuse and Health for Women Project Summary/Abstract Sexual minority women (SMW; lesbian, bisexual) experience substantial health disparities, including significantly higher rates of hazardous drinking, depression, and poor self-reported health compared to heterosexual women. However, there is a dearth of research examining resiliency factors and how these factors might vary by race/ethnicity among SMW. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) challenged researchers to examine factors that foster resilience among SMW including examining differences by race and ethnicity and exploring the positive impact on sexual minority (SM) health of the legal recognition of same-sex marriage. Studies have found strong associations between supportive policies, such as marriage recognition, and improved health outcomes among sexual minorities. However, there are gaps in understanding specific psycho-social factors may explain the impact of policies on SM health outcomes. To address these gaps in knowledge, we will draw on minority stress, intersectionality, and social-ecological frameworks and a mixed-methods research design to identify and assess factors that underlie the effect of marriage recognition on health and to examine relationships between these factors and three health outcomes among SMW: hazardous drinking, depression, and poor general health. Several key innovations ensure the success and high impact of this project. First, the proposed project leverages innovative methods from a currently funded project (R01 DA036606; Drabble & Trocki, multiple-PIs), which uses respondent-driven sampling (RDS) based on population-based ""seeds"" from the National Alcohol Survey (NAS) to collect data nationwide from a large and diverse population of approximately 1000 SMW. Second, by creating measures to describe how marriage recognition may influence health, our study contributes to the sparse but urgently needed research on resiliency among SMW. Third, the study contributes to emerging understanding of the impact of marriage recognition on health outcomes, with a special focus on differences in risk by race/ethnicity and how such risks may be attenuated by other risk/protective factors at individual, interpersonal, community, and sociopolitical levels. Finally, the study capitalizes on the recent historic national change in laws that now recognize same-sex marriage in all states, affording a timely opportunity to develop and test new scales designed to investigate how marriage recognition influences health outcomes among racially and ethnically diverse SMW. To do so, we will test the following aims: 1) Develop new measures to assess factors that underlie the impact of marriage recognition, using in-depth qualitative interviews with approximately 32 diverse SMW. 2) Assess the psychometric properties of the new measures among approximately 500-600 SMW, using item analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. 3) Examine the predictive value of these novel SMW-specific measures on hazardous drinking, depression and self-reported health, with specific focus on racial/ethnic differences. We will merge new data with previously collected data, which include rich demographic, risk and resiliency data from the same participants. Findings will be used in future studies with population-based and volunteer samples to inform prevention and intervention strategies aimed and building resiliency and reducing health disparities among SMW. Project Narrative We expect that the proposed research will substantially move forward the fields of women's health and substance use. Specifically, findings from studies using new measures will add significantly to the currently sparse knowledge about individual, interpersonal, and societal factors that contribute to health disparities among women, including differences by race/ethnicity and sexual identity. Such knowledge will support the development of culturally appropriate prevention and intervention strategies, as well as policies to reduce health disparities among women.",Effects of Marriage Recognition on Substance Abuse and Health for Women,9572406,R03MD011481,"['Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Employment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Housing ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Laws ', ' Marriage ', ' Methods ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Seeds ', ' seed ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' Lesbian ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Respondent ', ' Attenuated ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' psychological distress ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Legal ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Marriage and Family ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' Societal Factors ', ' Validation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' minority health ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' volunteer ', ' population based ', ' hazardous drinking ', ' sexual minority ', ' same-sex marriage ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' ethnic identity ', ' intersectionality ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMHD,PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE,R03,2018,74933,-0.029182751813423714

"Characteristics of suicide and homicide in a vulnerable population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) adolescents and adults, when compared to similar others, are at increased risk for suicide attempts and exposure to violence victimization. Suicide mortality is also elevated, especially among women, though research studies are sparse. Accordingly, NIH has formally designated sexual/gender minorities a health disparity population. Yet there remain large gaps in the scientific knowledge base that undermine development, dissemination and implementation of effective public health interventions to reduce risk in this vulnerable population. These include whether rates of homicide are similarly elevated among LGBT persons, whether suicide rates are elevated among the transgender population, what role gender and race/ethnicity play in shaping risk, as well as clarification of the contextual factors surrounding these deaths, including missed opportunities for intervention. The primary goal of the project is to identify patterns of risk and to characterize proximal factors associated with violent death due to suicide and homicide among LGBT individuals. Drawing from Minority Stress Theory and, for suicides, the `ideation-to-action' framework, we hypothesize that anti-gay stigma and discrimination creates a vulnerability for violent death among LGBT adolescents and adults. Capitalizing on new information classifying deaths for LGBT status in recent years of the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), we will make novel use of supervised machine learning techniques to recapture LGBT status among deaths in those 12 years and older in the 2003-2015 NVDRS (> 200,000 suicides, homicides, or homicide-suicides). Similar techniques will also be used to code NVDRS death narratives for co-occurring stigma-based contextual factors (e.g., gay disclosure, familial rejection), risk profiles (e.g. mental health, substance use), and recent services use in the immediate circumstances surrounding the death. This will allow us to achieve two study aims. For Aim 1, we will use NVDRS data and exogenous information estimating LGBT population size to generate state-level estimates of suicide and homicide rates, adjusted for population composition, among individuals 12 years and older. We hypothesize that LGBT population risk estimates for suicide and homicide will exceed those of non-LGBT populations. For Aim 2, we will identify sexual orientation and gender minority-linked differences in predisposing and proximal factors associated with suicide and homicide, including indicators of mental health and substance use, patterns of recent health care access, and characteristics of death circumstances, including HIV infection status. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we hypothesize that recent discrimination experiences will be strongly associated with sexual orientation and transgender status, that homicide deaths will more likely show evidence of hate-crime-related contextual factors, and that HIV-related issues will be an important though downward trending precipitant of suicide among sexual minority men. We also anticipate gender and ethnic/racial differences in these effects that will have important implications for future risk reducing interventions. Information obtained will greatly aid achieving the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Project 2025 goal of reducing the suicide rate 20% by 2025 and NIMH's Zero Suicide efforts by providing interventionists with data to design screening and intervention efforts for the LGBT population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project addresses an important public health problem—lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals likely experience higher rates of violent death, including suicide and possibly homicide, than other persons. Why this occurs has yet to be fully determined. This study investigates both predisposing and precipitating factors linked to violent death among LGBT individuals, age 12 years and older. Our goal is to identify modifiable, explanatory factors that can account for mortality disparities between LGBT and non-LGBT individuals.",Characteristics of suicide and homicide in a vulnerable

"Stress and Mortality Among Black Men PROJECT SUMMARY Black men age-adjusted mortality rate in 2014 was 21.1 percent higher than white men. While several factors have been hypothesized to account for these differences, stress has been noted as a key determinant of Black men's health. Because of its unique position at the nexus of social factors; psychological coping; and the associated physiologic response, stress is an ideal pathway for understanding health disparities. However, stress and its downstream consequences have received relatively little attention as it relates to Black men's mortality. Over the last four years, I having been building a program of research examining social, behavioral and economic determinants of Black men's health which serves as a foundation for this mid-career Independent Scientist (K02) award application. I have two immediate career objectives. First, I want to advance my career by integrating biomarker and genetic data into my existing research portfolio to better understand the basic mechanisms of Black men's stress, and mortality (Aim 1). Second, I want to apply the biopsychosocial model for explaining links between stress and mortality in Black men (Aim 2). My long-term career objective is to establish a national network of scholars who share similar research interest and create a center on men's health and aging (Aim 3). The K02 mechanism would provide me the protected time to achieve my immediate and long-term career goals. To assist in accomplishing my aims, I will be supported by an interdisciplinary group of world renown scholars who work spans a variety of fields including health of Black Americans, biology of stress, inflammation, cognition, biomarker data, longitudinal data, mortality, gerontology and geriatrics. Further I have the support of the Department of Health, Behavior, and Society at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The proposed research and training activities have the potential to propel me from being a mid-career scientist to an independent investigator in the area of Black Men's Health and mortality. Findings from the K02 will be used to inform subsequent research objectives to address unique risks associated with health and functional outcomes to inform policy makers of the evidence for the development of policy relevant solutions for Black men. My ability to conduct high level research and effectively collaborate positions me to take full advantage of what the K02 mechanism offers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Black men have the highest age-adjusted mortality rate of all American subgroups; however, there is a paucity of research that focuses on understanding how stress links to Black men’s mortality. This project seeks to apply a biopsychosocial model for explaining the links between stress and mortality in Black men by integrating biomarker data with social, psychological, and behavioral data. Findings will be to inform subsequent research objectives to address unique risks associated with health and functional outcomes to inform policy makers of the evidence for the development of policy relevant solutions for Black men.

" All of Us Research Program National Sexual and Gender Minority Engagement Network The All of Us Research Program has an explicit goal to enroll at least 1 million people from all communities to reflect the rich diversity of our nation. To truly engage our broad national diversity, a specific focus on sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals is critical. Engaging SGM people will help ensure equitable representation of the US population in All of Us, biological heterogeneity for high-quality discovery science, and diverse input in All of Us-based research via citizen-scientists and traditional researchers. Our proposal aims to engage SGM people on a national scale to help the All of Us Research Program realize its ambitious goals. SGM people – including members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) communities – are everywhere, demographically diverse, and represent all segments of society. SGM people account for an estimated 4.1% (~13 million people) of the US population. SGM individuals compose an identity-based population that includes sexual minorities (individuals with a sexual orientation that is not heterosexual) and gender minorities (individuals with a gender identity that is not congruent with their sex assigned at birth). SGM communities share a common experience of social marginalization, legal discrimination, political disenfranchisement, and familial rejection. Despite limited data, SGM people are believed to live in nearly all counties in the United States, be a part of other underrepresented minority groups, be in every socioeconomic stratum, and speak the diversity of languages in our nation. To examine this, we recently analyzed all the last three years (2013-2015) of National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data (manuscript under review) and found that self-identified lesbian, gay, and bisexual people were primarily younger (28% were 18-29 years old, 17% were 30-39, 20% were 40-49, 26% were 50-64, and 9% were 65 years or older). Approximately 14% were of Hispanic ethnicity. Regarding race, 80% were Caucasian, 15% were African/African-American, and 5% were another race. Approximately 30% reported an annual earned income of $0 while 11% reported earning more than $75,000. SGM people are largely invisible in federal population-based efforts because they are not counted. Because sexual orientation and gender identity are not collected during the decennial US Census, the precise number of SGM people in the US as well as their age, geographic, linguistic, race, ethnicity, income, and regional distributions are unknown. Without these data, national population-based studies (e.g., National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, NHANES) are unable to generate sampling frames that adequately account for the disproportionate geographic distribution of SGM people (e.g., San Francisco city census reports that ~15% identify as SGM). In 2010, the NIH commissioned the Institute of Medicine (now National Academy of Medicine) to study SGM health to inform the nation’s SGM health research agenda. In addition to recommending research in nearly all aspects of health, the consensus committee poignantly stated, “[t]he relative lack of population-based data presents the greatest challenge to describing the health status and health-related needs of LGBT people” and emphasized the need for national research efforts, such as All of Us, to explicitly include data measures or questions about SGM identity. This report and other research led the National Center for Health Statistics to include sexual orientation in the NHIS and the NIH to designate the SGM population as a “health disparity population for research purposes” in October 2016. SGM people are an underserved and understudied population that is vulnerable to poor health. SGM people experience unique health and healthcare disparities including higher rates of smoking, HIV infection, certain cancers, depression, suicide attempts, and delaying access to health care. Infrequent collection of sexual orientation and gender identity data in clinical settings makes performing SGM-specific studies challenging. Healthcare providers receive inadequate training in caring for SGM patients that often results in mistreatment or discrimination, which deters research participation. While these inequities have been associated with societal stigmatization and minority stress in small studies, difficulties identifying and studying SGM communities severely hinder the identification of health disparity etiologies and the design of appropriate interventions. By meaningfully including and engaging SGM people, the All of Us Research Program has the potential to have a tremendous impact the health and well-being of millions.

"Sexual Orientation/Gender Identity, Socioeconomic Status, and Health across the Life Course Abstract Socioeconomic status (SES) is a fundamental contributor to health and disease across the life course. Inequalities in health that disfavor sexual and gender minorities have been widely documented in both adolescence and adulthood. Despite the importance of SES to health, knowledge about factors that pattern these resources and strains across sexual and gender minority groups is incomplete, largely because of the absence of appropriate and high quality data, as well as study design limitations for data that do exist. In synchrony with the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) Wave V program project design and activity, this proposed ancillary project will collect, clean, disseminate, and analyze new data from a subset of the Add Health cohort (sexual minorities, transgendered individuals, and a comparison sample of heterosexuals) via a theory-guided ancillary survey that will add information about formative experiences more specific to sexual orientation and gender development, and enhance existing prospective information about SES and determinants of SES. Based on Wave IV data we plan to recruit approximately 2,200 self-identified sexual/gender minorities and a random comparison sample of 1,500 heterosexuals. The unique data collected via this project will provide an unprecedented opportunity for new and current Add Health users to prospectively study the intersections of sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic factors, and health in a population-based sample across the life course at only marginal cost. Positioned within a life course framework and guided by Minority Stress Theory, we will also address three substantive analytical aims using the released ancillary data: 1) to describe the timing and sequence of theoretical milestones in the development of sexual orientation and gender identity; 2) to examine potential mediators (i.e., parent-child relationship quality and subsequent adolescent educational attainment and housing status) of the association between sexual orientation, gender identity, and young adult SES; and 3) to test a hypothesized pathway that economic strain heightens stress, which in turn elevates depressive symptoms. Findings made possible through these new data, in combination with existing longitudinal information about Add Health sample members, have the potential for critical impact on public health policy and intervention strategies to reduce the prevalence of and disparities in disease burden for the sexual and gender minority population. Project Narrative Despite the importance of socioeconomic status to health and documented health inequalities that disfavor sexual and gender minorities, knowledge about factors that pattern these resources and strains across sexual and gender minority groups is incomplete, largely because of the absence of appropriate and high quality data. This cost effective project will build on the population-based National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health by collecting and disseminating data to address these critical knowledge gaps and by testing hypotheses linking economic strain and health across the life course to inform public health policy and interventions.","Sexual Orientation/Gender Identity, Socioeconomic Status, and Health across the Life Course",9569277,R01HD087365,"['Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Family ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Data Quality ', ' Inequality ', ' Re 80 ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' Respondent ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' health knowledge ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' experience ', ' intergenerational ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Monitor ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' population based ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' health inequalities ', ' sexual minority ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' data resource ', ' recruit ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Discrimination ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,615033,0.02568274188127821
"Factors influencing vasectomy use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed four-year K01 Population Research Scientist Development Award supports the development of Dr. Kari White as an independent social scientist and public health researcher conducting studies of the impact of health service delivery models and policies on access to and use of highly effective contraception, with the aim of reducing disparities in unintended pregnancy. This is relevant to the NICHD mission and stated interest in research relevant to ensuring that women and men have access to safe, effective and acceptable contraceptive methods. Dr. White brings her solid training in the demography of fertility and use of qualitative and quantitative research methods to the study of contraceptive use. Her career development plan has three main goals: 1) develop expertise in methods to evaluate health services and policy from the individual perspective; 2) gain in-depth knowledge of contraceptive methods and exposure to how contraceptive services are provided; and 3) acquire advanced statistical skills and proficiency working with new data sources to analyze policies and health outcomes. These goals will be met through formal coursework, mentoring from sponsors, directed study with expert advisors, clinical observation, and conferences. She will integrate her current knowledge and skill set with those gained through the career development activities by conducting a study of the individual-, provider- and health systems-level factors contributing to the underutilization of vasectomy among low-income men in the United States. Greater use of vasectomy has the potential to reduce income-based disparities in unintended pregnancy, but there has been limited study of why this method is so little used among low-income men. To comprehensively examine the factors shaping both the demand (individual-level) and supply (provider- and health systems-level) of vasectomy, the research project aims to: 1) assess knowledge, attitudes and interest in vasectomy among low-income men who do not want more children; 2) identify barriers to providing vasectomy services to low-income men among providers at publicly funded family planning organizations and health centers; and 3) evaluate whether expanded Medicaid family planning coverage for low-income men increases vasectomy use and identify the characteristics of men getting vasectomies through the program. In sum, this career development award will provide Dr. White the structured mentoring, advanced multi-disciplinary training, and experience conducting original research that will facilitate her transition to an independent investigator leading studies on contraception. These studies will allow her to make significant contributions to understanding one of the key determinants of unintended pregnancy and that can be used to inform clinical practice and health policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To reduce the persistently high rates of unintended pregnancy in the United States, efforts are needed to increase access to and use of highly effective contraceptive methods. Vasectomy is a safe, highly effective and cost effective method for men and couples who do not want more children, but it is rarely used among low- income groups, who have disproportionately high rates of unintended pregnancy. The proposed study will conduct an in-depth assessment of the existing obstacles to vasectomy among low-income men; these findings will identify potential approaches to improve access to and use of this method that can be used to inform clinical practice and health policy.",Factors influencing vasectomy use,9394728,K01HD079563,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Client ', ' Family Planning ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Contraceptive Agents ', ' Contraceptives ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Counseling ', ' Couples ', ' Data Sources ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Demography ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Female Sterilization ', ' Fertility ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Medicaid ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Perception ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vasectomy ', ' Woman ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' State Interests ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Reporting ', ' Contraceptive methods ', ' Inhibition of Fertilization ', ' Fertility Control ', ' Contraception ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' career development ', ' Provider ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Low income ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Sum ', ' Cognitive ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Unplanned pregnancy ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' childbearing ', ' bearing children ', ' bear children ', ' child bearing ', ' twenty years of age ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' 20 years of age ', ' 20 year old ', ' federal poverty level ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical practice ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' lower income families ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' care delivery model ', ' Service model ', ' Service delivery model ', ' system-level barriers ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,K01,2018,130374,0.050036325076214104
"Implicit Internalized Stigma: Measuring and Examining a Determinant of Mental Health Disparities for Sexual Minorities Project Summary/Abstract Sexual minorities continue to face mental health disparities – recent national data show that 37% of sexual minority adults had a mental illness. Stigma can exist internally among sexual minorities when they internalize negative attitudes about themselves via pervasive societal homophobia. Internalized stigma is a key determinant of mental health disparities for sexual minorities; however, the implicit or subconscious dimension of internalized stigma has been almost completely overlooked in research and clinical practice, perhaps because there is not a valid and reliable instrument to measure this phenomenon. To address gaps in this area, this project has three aims: (1) Creating an implicit internalized sexual minority stigma instrument using an Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP) approach; (2) Evaluating the reliability (internal consistency and test-retest reliability) and validity (convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity) of the implicit internalized sexual minority stigma version of the AMP; and (3) Examining concurrent and predictive relationships between implicit internalized sexual minority stigma and outcomes of depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms. Developing the measure will involve a mixed-methods approach: generating visual stimuli for the measure (i.e., images of heterosexual and same-sex couples), evaluating couple images to balance across groups, interviewing experts to identify valence response options, programming the measure for online administration, pilot-testing the preliminary measure with a sample of 100 sexual minority adults, and dropping unreliable response dimensions based on pre-testing. Evaluating the psychometrics of the final measure will involve online data collection from 400 sexual minority adults across two waves and administration of measures of implicit and explicit internalized stigma. Examining relations between implicit internalized stigma and mental health outcomes will use the sample of 400 sexual minority adults assessed at two waves, and data collection on depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and relevant covariates to isolate the effect of implicit internalized stigma on mental health. Analyses, will involve reliability analysis, pairwise correlations, and cross-lagged panel modeling. This project is innovative and significant because it has the potential to shift research and clinical practice, which has almost exclusively focused on explicit internalized stigma. The instrument could be used in epidemiological research to understand implicit internalized stigma as a determinant of mental health disparities. It could also be used in intervention research and clinical practice as a target mechanism to improve mental health among sexual minorities. Project Narrative Sexual minorities experience pronounced mental health disparities in terms of anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and suicidality. Stigma is a key determinant of mental health disparities for sexual minorities; however, implicit internalized stigma has been almost completely overlooked in clinical practice and research. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will allow researchers and practitioners to assess the presence and impact of an important stigma mechanism, which can be the focus of preventive interventions and clinical treatments to improve the mental health of the sexual minority community.",Implicit Internalized Stigma: Measuring and Examining a Determinant of Mental Health Disparities for Sexual Minorities,9509981,R21MD012687,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Guilt ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morals ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Shame ', ' sound ', ' Subconscious ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Son of Sevenless Proteins ', ' son of sevenless protein ', ' SOS exchange factor ', ' SOS Proteins ', ' SOS ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Individual ', ' self knowledge ', ' self awareness ', ' Self view ', ' Self image ', ' Personal awareness ', ' Self Perception ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' experience ', ' visual stimulus ', ' treatment planning ', ' Prevention ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Drops ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Sum ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' minority health ', ' neglect ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical practice ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' same-sex couple ', ' same sex relationship ', ' same sex partner ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' queer ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2018,230837,-0.0004417603182810853
"Health, Stress, and Tobacco Use Disparities among Sexual Minority Populations PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In response to PA-15-261: The Health of Sexual and Gender Minority Populations, this project “Health, Stress, and Tobacco Use Disparities among Sexual Minority Populations” proposes to use an existing nationally representative dataset to assess the relationships among sexual orientation, discrimination, stress, tobacco/nicotine use behaviors, and DSM-5 tobacco use disorder in the U.S. Tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of death; cigarette smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year in the U.S. Past research has generally found sexual minorities are at heightened risk for cigarette smoking and other tobacco/nicotine use. However, many of these studies are plagued by methodological limitations including small, non-representative samples, lack of heterosexual comparison groups and/or limited sexual orientation measures. To date, no nationally representative studies have examined the DSM-5 tobacco use disorder disparities among sexual minorities and few data exists on severity, comorbidity, disability, help seeking, and recovery associated with DSM-5 tobacco use disorder among sexual minorities. Thus, we propose to build on our prior work and conduct secondary analyses of the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC-III), a nationally representative survey of 36,309 U.S. adults 18 years and older in the U.S. The NESARC-III study represents the only nationally representative study that has sufficient measures and sample size to test for potential age, gender, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic status differences and to meet the objectives of our study, which aims to: (1) examine the prevalence of (a) cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use, and other tobacco/nicotine use, (b) DSM-5 tobacco use disorder severity (includes tobacco and/or nicotine products), and (c) comorbidity of DSM-5 tobacco use disorder and mental health disorders based on major dimensions of sexual orientation (attraction, behavior, and identity); (2) assess the disability (e.g., general health, physical functioning, and social functioning), help seeking (e.g., counseling, nicotine replacement therapy, and medication), and recovery (e.g., early and sustained remission) associated with tobacco/nicotine use and DSM-5 tobacco use disorder based on sexual orientation; and (3) determine the relationships among stressful events, sexual orientation discrimination (individual-level and institutional-level), tobacco/nicotine use and DSM-5 tobacco use disorder based on the Comprehensive Developmental and Minority Stress Model. This project will take advantage of the unique opportunities afforded by the 2012-2013 NESARC-III: the availability of an ethnically / racially diverse sample with large numbers of sexual minorities; the inclusion of multiple measures of sexual orientation based on attraction, behavior and identity; and the wealth of data on cigarette smoking, other tobacco/nicotine use, DSM-5 tobacco use disorder, and DSM-5 mental health disorders. Measures of stressful life events and sexual orientation discrimination will enable assessment of two of the major factors presumed to account for health disparities among sexual minorities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Findings from this project will enhance our understanding of tobacco-related health disparities among sexual minorities in the United States. Understanding prevalence, risk factors, resilience factors, severity, disability, help seeking and recovery associated with DSM-5 tobacco use disorder across sub-groups based on multiple dimensions of sexual orientation is critical for addressing health disparities and designing effective public health prevention and intervention efforts. This project examines new research questions related to tobacco/nicotine use across dimensions of sexual orientation, as well as potential mechanisms underlying tobacco-related health disparities among sexual minorities with a focus on stress, individual-level and institutional-level sexual orientation discrimination.","Health, Stress, and Tobacco Use Disparities among Sexual Minority Populations",9509377,R01CA212517,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Health ', ' Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' Nicotine ', ' Peer Review ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Stress ', ' Stressful Event ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Tobacco Use Disorder ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Family member ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' disability ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' cigarette use ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Physical Function ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Disease remission ', ' Remission ', ' Manuscripts ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' DSM-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' DSM5 ', ' DSM-5 ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' comparison group ', ' Social Functioning ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' sexual minority ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' secondhand smoke exposure ', ' second hand smoke exposure ', ' exposure to tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to SHS ', ' exposure to ETS ', ' Passive Smoke Exposure ', ' environmental tobacco smoke exposure ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' secondary analysis ', ' nicotine consumption ', ' nicotine use ', ' ecigarette use ', ' ecig use ', ' e-cigarette use ', ' e-cig use ', ' electronic cigarette use ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,288015,-0.024117336045751423
"MOCHA Moving Forward:  a CBPR investigation of chronic disease prevention in older, low-income African-American men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research is designed to use a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach to achieve three research objectives: (1) to identify factors that can be incorporated into expanded Minority Stress Model developed by the PI; (2) to evaluate the effectiveness of the Men of Color Health Awareness (MOCHA) program, and an enhanced MOCHA+ program that uses narrative communication strategies, in lowering stress and risk of chronic diseases in a randomized controlled trial; and (3) to determine those individual, interpersonal and social structural factors that have an impact on stress and the health of low income African- American men. The MOCHA program is the result of a grassroots, community-driven initiative to address the heavy burden of health disparities experienced by low-income African-American men living in Springfield MA. The MOCHA program is sustained by a public - private collaboration between the local chapter of the YMCA and the state Department of Public Health. The MOCHA program is designed to address the physical, mental, social, and spiritual needs of men of color simultaneously in an integrated fashion. It consists of a 12-week program comprised of: (1) 60-minutes of moderately intensive aerobic exercise twice a week; (2) small group discussions of issues facing men of color, in particular, the potentially harmful effects of socially constructed definitions of black masculinity and associated issues of stress, violence, depression and substance abuse; (3) classes on health topics pertinent to chronic disease control, such as nutrition, obesity, high blood pressure, fitness and the social determinants of health. In utilizing a CBPR methodology, university researchers will partner with the MOCHA Steering Committee in all phases of the research, from identifying the main research questions, to identifying mediating factors implicit in the MOCHA model to utilizing appropriate research instruments to answer the primary research question, to data collection and analysis, to disseminating the results of the research, in appropriate fashion, to different audiences. The proposed research methods include: individual interviews of MOCHA participants, ethnographic field observations of digital storytelling (DST) workshops, survey questionnaires and the collection of physiological measures such as cortisol, blood pressure, and BMI. The results of this research will contribute to the identification of effective interventins to address health disparities in low-income African-American men and the dissemination of effective chronic disease prevention programming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African-American men continue to bear a disproportionate share of the burden of health disparities, in general, and chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes, in particular. It is vitally important to identify effective strategies to ameliorate these health inequities. The research plan presented here will identify factors that have the greatest influence on stress and health behaviors in low-income African-American men between the ages 45-65, and determine the effectiveness of an innovative, community-driven program to improve the health and quality of life of these men.","MOCHA Moving Forward:  a CBPR investigation of chronic disease prevention in older, low-income African-American men",9431059,U01MD010618,"['Aerobic Exercise ', ' Aerobic fitness ', ' Aerobic Activity ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Awareness ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' ELISA ', ' Exercise ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Interview ', ' Logic ', ' Massachusetts ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mission ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Morbidity -

"Effects of Acute Alcohol on Sex-Specific Delay Discounting and Subsequent Sexual Decision Making among MSM ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K08 research and training award will enable the PI to develop skills as an independent clinical scientist using advanced research methodology to ultimately (a) uncover new mechanisms of action underlying the association between acute alcohol and risky sexual behavior among men who have sex with men (MSM), and (b) use that knowledge to refine preventative interventions targeting alcohol-related HIV-risk behavior within this high-priority population.. Preliminary findings suggest that domain-general impulsive delay discounting is associated with sexual risk-taking in the context of co-occurring alcohol use. Measures of SSDD tend to outperform domain-general discounting measures in terms of strength of association with risky sexual behavior. The proposed project would be the first to examine the causal effects of acute alcohol on SSDD, and subsequent effects on sexual decision making among MSM. Formative research (Phase 1) will involve qualitative exploration of men's personal experience of sexual impulsivity, as well as qualitative feedback to adapt and refine our experimental paradigm to match the target population. Pilot research (Phase 2) will be conducted to bridge the formative phase and full experimental investigation (Phase 3). Adult MSM who are single, sexually active, and engage in heavy drinking will be recruited from the local community to participate in the qualitative focus groups (Phase 1; N=30-48), pilot testing of experimental protocol (Phase 2; N=12), and the full experimental trial (Phase 3; N=180). The full single-session experiment will employ an alcohol/placebo/nonalcohol design with random assignment to one of three conditions (i.e., alcohol at 0.8g/kg dose, placebo, and true control) to examine the acute effects of alcohol (i.e., both pharmacological and expectancy) on SSDD, and the subsequent effects on risky sexual decision making (i.e., intention to engage in unprotected anal intercourse). This research will lead to subsequent grant applications to (a) extend this line of human laboratory research, and (b) develop a behavioral economic supplement to brief preventative intervention targeting alcohol-related HIV risk behavior. The PI will work with a highly skilled mentorship team (Drs. Peter Monti, Don Operario, James MacKillop, James Murphy, and David Jarmolowicz) to build four areas of expertise relevant to this research agenda: 1) experimental and qualitative research methodology; 2) behavioral economics of sexual decision making; 3) health disparities in MSM populations; and 4) preventative intervention, with specific emphasis on HIV risk behavior. This K08 proposal addresses a key priority in national public health, and the science of alcohol- related HIV-risk behavior, and will fully prepare the PI for an independent research career in clinical science. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Men who have sex with men (MSM) bear the heaviest burden of the HIV epidemic in the United States, and the transmission rate in this population is rising. This project will contribute to a greater understanding of how alcohol influences impulsive decision making and sexual risk taking among MSM. This information will guide the development of new preventative interventions targeting heavy drinking and sexual impulsivity as a means to reduce alcohol-related sexual risk taking and HIV transmission in this high risk and underserved population.",Effects of Acute Alcohol on Sex-Specific Delay Discounting and Subsequent Sexual Decision Making among MSM,9416046,K08AA024056,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Behavior ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Epidemic ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Perception ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Placebo Effect ', ' placebo response ', ' nocebo ', ' expectation effect ', ' expectancy effect ', ' Placebos ', ' sham therapy ', ' Sham Treatment ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' sexually active ', ' Glare ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' interest ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' experience ', ' alcohol effect ', ' ethanol effect ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Heavy Drinking ', ' heavy alcohol use ', ' extreme drinking ', ' excessive ethanol ingestion ', ' excessive drinking ', ' excessive alcohol intake ', ' excessive alcohol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol consumption ', ' excess ethanol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol ingestion ', ' excess alcohol consumption ', ' drink heavily ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' HIV risk ', ' risk perception ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Cognitive ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' discount ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' discounting ', ' Expectancy ', ' Population ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' alcohol risk ', ' sexual risk taking ', ' behavioral economics ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIAAA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,K08,2018,195480,-0.0004441128830592319
"Online Advertising for Skin Cancer Prevention Abstract/Executive Summary Skin cancer is the most common cancer – more common than all other cancers combined. Despite public health efforts, melanoma rates are still increasing. The proposed research addresses this important problem using an innovative approach: using online advertising and social media to target groups at risk of skin cancer. Additionally, it addresses health disparities by focusing on gay men, who are an understudied, high-risk population. Finally, our novel approach allows for unprecedented reach at relatively low intervention cost. Our team has extensive experience with observational and interventional behavioral research using social media as well as significant experience working with sexual minority men. Our central hypothesis is that targeted online prevention messages can influence knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors about tanning among gay men. The rationale underlying this research is that one of the groups at highest risk of developing melanoma from tanning bed exposure – gay men – is engaged on social media, so this is the platform to best reach them. In Aim 1, we will identify which melanoma prevention messages are most effective for gay men. Using focus groups, cognitive interviews, and online response data, we will determine the most persuasive messages that motivate gay men to avoid tanning beds. In Aim 2, we will assess the impact of melanoma prevention messages on knowledge and behaviors relevant to melanoma risk and on self-reported intent to use tanning beds, which is a validated proxy for tanning behavior. We will first optimize the delivery of our prevention messages by assessing how timing (season and time of day), frequency, and number of messages impact engagement with a prevention message: including number of views and clicks that direct to a website with melanoma prevention information. We will then test the effect of prevention messages by performing a rapid, randomized, controlled trial on Facebook (using the most effective messages identified in Aim 1) placed as advertisements. The intervention group and control group will each include 3,600 gay men, for a total study population of 7,200 gay men. These specific aims have been designed to provide the essential feasibility and preliminary efficacy data to support future large-scale and long-term research on the impact of targeted online prevention messages on hard outcomes, such as reductions in actual tanning bed use and decreases in state-specific melanoma incidence.

"Revealing women's hidden role as critical components of HIV transmission networks in Rakai, Uganda: an interdisciplinary approach ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The burden of HIV is ~60% higher in women than men in sub-Saharan Africa, and this gender inequity is a key challenge to HIV control. Identifying women at greatest risk for HIV and their infecting male partners is critical for effective, targeted control of the African HIV epidemic. It is also vital to identify those HIV-infected women most likely to contribute to ongoing viral spread. However, African women vastly underreport sexual contacts and high risk occupations such as sex work in interview-based surveys and clinical settings making their identification challenging. Here, we propose to use phylogenetic, epidemiological, and qualitative methods to study network drivers of female risk of HIV acquisition and onward transmission to men in the rural Rakai District, Uganda. We will use existing data from the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS), a population- based study of HIV incidence and behaviors in 50 communities (n~17,000). In Aim 1 we will identify HIV- infected women who have central roles in transmission networks using viral phylogenetics and then characterize them with RCCS epidemiological data. We will also conduct in-depth interviews with these women to gain deeper insight into their HIV-related risks and to understand the barriers to reporting these risks. In Aim 2 we will use viral phylogenetics in conjunction with probabilistic statistical models to identify the pool of infecting male partners tat sustain the excess HIV burden among Rakai women. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will use microsimulation models to estimate the potential effectiveness of various combination HIV prevention strategies targeted to high risk subgroups to reduce HIV incidence. The proposed research is part of a K01 award and will provide the applicant with the advanced training in HIV modelling, behavioral science, and phylogenetics necessary to transition to an independent investigator with expertise in the application of interdisciplinary methods to HIV epidemiology and prevention. Results will improve female HIV risk assessment and identify candidate targeted strategies to prevent HIV in African women. It also will provide critical formative data fr a future R01 to implement and empirically assess the effectiveness of targeted interventions to high risk women and their partners in Rakai. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The success of interventions to reduce female HIV risk depends upon an understanding of the drivers of excess HIV infection in women. This project studies network drivers of female HIV risk and onward transmission to men in rural Uganda using interdisciplinary methods. We also explore barriers to HIV risk assessment in a setting where women vastly underreport sex work and risky sexual partnerships. This study will inform targeted PEPFAR initiatives to prevent HIV in high risk African women such as DREAMS.","Revealing women's hidden role as critical components of HIV transmission networks in Rakai, Uganda: an interdisciplinary approach",9442677,K01AI125086,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Female ', ' Fishes ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Phylogeny ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Uganda ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Rural ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' Viral ', ' success ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Prevention ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Abate ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Gifts ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Length ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' demographics ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' data format ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' ']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,127586,0.03370268202158088
"Restore: Improving Sexual Outcomes of Gay and Bisexual Prostate Cancer Survivors Abstract: This application, in response to PA-15-261, “Research leading to interventions to ameliorate health disparities of sexual and gender minorities”, advances research in three areas. First, prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM), with documented disparities, yet it is severely under-researched. Because gay sex differs from vaginal sex, physiologically; the results from 614 studies focused on heterosexual men likely do not generalize to GBM with PCa. There have been no rehabilitation studies specific to GBM survivors of PCa, so clinicians have no relevant studies to inform best practice with their GBM patients. Second, most PCa studies have tested one or rehabilitation components. We will conduct the first treatment study of a state of clinical practice comprehensive rehabilitation program on GBM's quality of life, including on both urinary and sexual function and bother measures. Third, almost all PCa studies have focused on men recently treated for PCa. We will study both GBM recently treated (last 2 years) and GBM post-treatment (2+ years), using a stratified design.  This study builds on our findings in Restore, an R21 which was only the second study of GBM with PCa to be funded by NCI, and the first to reach publication. We conducted N=41 in-depth qualitative interviews with good saturation, and the largest quantitative study of GBM with PCa to date (N=193), the first needs assessment of GBM with PCa, and the first study of same sex partners and care-givers of GBM. Participants described radical prostatectomy as leaving them “humiliated,” “maimed”, “less than other gay men,” and “severely depressed.” Most (88%) reported ongoing sexual challenges contributing to decreased quality of life, poorer mental health, identity challenges and deteriorated primary relationships. Only three of the eight (38%) outcomes commonly experienced by most GBM were discussed as part of treatment. There was no evidence of any standard of professional rehabilitation; indeed, most GBM just treated themselves.  The long-term objective of this research is to improve the health of GBM survivors of PCa and to provide an evidence base for rehabilitation. In Aim I, we will develop an online rehabilitation program tailored for GBM that addresses both the sexual and urinary effects of PCa treatment. In Aim II, we will conduct a comparative recruitment study to identify best methods to recruit 450 GBM with PCa. In Aim III, we will evaluate the effects of the tailored rehabilitation program on sexual and urinary outcomes. We will conduct a 24 month, randomized controlled trial of structured rehabilitation versus routine care. This RCT will identify whether a structured rehabilitation program is effective in addressing the major sexual and urinary problems caused by PCa treatment. As the first treatment study to focus on GBM with PCa (and also on oral and anal sex), it addresses a long-standing health disparity. The study has high potential to transform rehabilitation for GBM with PCa, provide a critical evidence base for clinicians, and inform rehabilitation outcomes for all PCa survivors. PCa is the second most common cancer in GBM, yet it has been severely under-researched. Because there have been no treatment studies of GBM with PCa, we do not know how well treatments work in this population. Because gay sex differs from vaginal sex, physiologically; the results from 614 studies focused on heterosexual men likely do not generalize to GBM with PCa. This study will test the effects of a multi- component online treatment program tailored for GBM survivors on their sexual and urinary outcomes. If successful, the study will demonstrate a new standard of rehabilitation care for this population.",Restore: Improving Sexual Outcomes of Gay and Bisexual Prostate Cancer Survivors,9528534,R01CA218657,"['Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Exercise ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Interview ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urinary Incontinence ', ' Vacuum Pumps ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Survivors ', ' Pelvic Floor ', ' Pelvic floor structure ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' Anal Sex ', ' Oral Sex ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Bladder Control ', ' urination control ', ' urinary control ', ' urinary continence ', ' micturition control ', ' bladder continence ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Sexual Dysfunction ', ' Sex Disorders ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' Rehabilitation Outcome ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' treatment program ', ' Reporting ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' urinary ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' treatment center ', ' sexual functioning ', ' Sex Functioning ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prostate cancer treatment ', ' Prostate CA therapy ', ' Prostate Cancer therapy ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' treatment effect ', ' comparative ', ' demographics ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' routine care ', ' clinical practice ', ' arm ', ' same-sex couple ', ' same sex relationship ', ' same sex partner ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' community center ', ' rehabilitation care ', ' rehabilitative care ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,720659,-0.022596775816505994
"The Tuskegee Syphilis Study and the Health of Black Men ABSTRACT  Achieving health equity among demographic groups is a crucial policy aim. Despite this policy focus, substantial gaps in health outcomes between black and white Americans remain, and black men consistently rank lowest on a broad array of health outcomes. A growing body of qualitative literature, as well as anecdotal evidence, suggests that mistrust of healthcare institutions explains some of this inequity. Still, both theoretical and empirical research on the causal role of medical mistrust in health disparities remains thin.  We propose to partially fill this gap in the literature using the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis as a case study. The proposed research will be the first to estimate the impact of the Tuskegee study disclosure in 1972 on the behavior and subsequent health outcomes of black men. Because we observe outcomes and behaviors both before and after the 1972 disclosure, we can quantify the effect in a quasi-experimental context. The timing of the Tuskegee disclosure coincides with the advent of a period of rising mortality inequality for black men relative to their white peers. This divergence, which we date to the mid-1970s, reversed patterns of convergence apparent throughout the 1960s. The role of historic deceptions in the evolution of these disadvantages for black men, along with possible mitigating factors, are understudied but crucially important areas of research that affect disadvantaged populations around the globe.  This project has two specific aims: (1) To estimate the impact of the Tuskegee study disclosure on racial disparities in health-seeking behavior (as reflected in care avoidance and/or delay) and in mortality using predictions derived from economic decision theory. To achieve Aim 1, we have developed a theoretical basis for the evolution of medical mistrust and medical service uptake to inform the proposed empirical methodology. In addition, we propose (2) To evaluate whether the effects of the Tuskegee disclosure on health behaviors and outcomes were mitigated by the availability of minority providers, previous experience with the medical system, or socioeconomic status.  The proposed study has several advantages. First, documenting the temporal profile of racial health disparities among men is a substantial contribution to a thin literature on health outcomes in the years immediately following the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the implementation of Medicare and Medicaid Acts in the United States. Second, medical mistrust is difficult (and unethical) to randomize in an experimental setting, and the Tuskegee event provides a “natural experiment” which is race-specific and has a sharp disclosure date, facilitating comparisons of behavior before and after 1972. The timing of the event also allows us to measure longer-run outcomes for those exposed to information about the event. Third, an exploration of effective strategies to reduce the impact of mistrust on health disparities provides policy-relevant lessons that can aid in furthering the aim of health equity today. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achieving health equity and eliminating health disparities is one of the four overarching goals of Healthy People 2020, although great strides have been made, health disparities between black and white Americans are still profound. The proposed research will provide novel evidence on whether and to what extent mistrust shapes the demand for health care, particularly among minority populations thereby contributing to steep health gradients. Because medical mistrust is difficult (and unethical) to randomize in an experimental setting, we use the Tuskegee syphilis study as a “natural experiment” and examine it impact on health seeking behavior and outcomes; we explore effective strategies to reduce the impact of mistrust on health disparities provides policy-relevant lessons that can aid in furthering the aim of health equity today.",The Tuskegee Syphilis Study and the Health of Black Men,9571129,R03MD011449,"['Affect ', ' Alabama ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Civil Rights ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Theory ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Ebola virus ', ' ebolavirus ', ' Ebola ', ' EBOV ', ' Economics ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Evolution ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Literature ', ' Deception ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Penicillins ', ' Penicillin Antibiotics ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Syphilis ', ' great pox ', ' Testing ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Chills ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Early Intervention ', ' uptake ', ' news ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' Health Care Sector ', ' Healthcare Sector ', ' Inferior ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' mortality statistics ', ' disease natural history ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' research study ', ' Study Subject ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' migration ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' combat ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' health equity ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' racial health disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' health seeking behavior ', ' differences in health ', ' health difference ', ' ']",NIMHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R03,2018,78500,0.030442622849775638
"Self-Management of Diabetes in Black Men: The Men are Now United Program (MANUP) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant racial disparities between non-Hispanic Blacks and Whites exist in the prevalence of diabetes and the story of John Henry, the ""steel-drivin'"" man is well known to most Black men in the U.S.; and to most, John Henry is a hero because of his relentless determination. John Henryism is defined as a survival strategy developed among newly freed Black people, one that endorsed the values of hard work, self-reliance, and high effort coping ─ all attributes of successful chronic disease self-management. The goal of this research is to develop a culturally-grounded diabetes self-management intervention for adult Black men. Black men are identified as a priority group in need of targeted diabetes self-management interventions. T T with type 2 diabetes that utilizes social support and mobile technology to improve patient-centered outcomes. The primary outcome will be a 0.5% reduction in A1C levels following the intervention. Secondary outcomes will include reductions in diabetes complication risk factors of blood pressure, waist circumference, and cholesterol. Additional outcomes include medication adherence, blood glucose monitoring, and physical activity. The 10-week intervention is comprised of three components: (1) ten group-based social support meetings that will include the formation of two-man partnerships (""buddies""); (2) a remote-sensing health behavioral technology, the cloud-based Telcare glucometer to facilitate objective monitoring of health behavior; (3) development of gender-sensitive, culturally grounded text messages designed to motivate and remind participants to engage in recommended self- management behaviors. Year one is devoted to designing the group intervention and developing and testing the set of targeted text messages by drawing upon self-determination theory, the diabetes empowerment approach, and research on John Henryism. Given its broad recognition and endorsement among Black men, the story of John Henry and research on John Henryism holds tremendous promise as a conceptual foundation for engaging Black men in a health promotion program. Year two will test the 10-week intervention using a wait-listed control (the men will serve as their own control), repeated measures single arm design (three points in time) with 40 Black men. The study also includes a three-month post-intervention follow-up assessment. Pragmatically, we have chosen to focus on behavior that can be influenced by one-to-one partnerships and small groups. As this targeted research program develops, we will incorporate the influence of family systems and neighborhood contexts within which Black men operate. In summary, Black men with type 2 diabetes can benefit from applying the principles of self-determination, diabetes empowerment, and John Henryism to their own health challenges. The proposed research will develop a gender targeted self-management intervention to assist adult Black men in controlling diabetes through social support and mobile health technology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health relevance of this project is evident in four important issues. First, U.S. ethnic minorities suffer higher rates of diabetes than non-Hispanic Whites. Second, these disparities are evident at every level of socioeconomic status. Third, diabetes is a disease that is modifiable through behaviors that can be controlled directly by the patient. Fourth, many black men need support to control their diabetes. Any intervention that successfully increases preventive behavior will improve overall health and potentially reduce racial disparities.",Self-Management of Diabetes in Black Men: The Men are Now United Program (MANUP),9341397,R21NR015589,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Group Meetings ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Self Determination ', ' Support Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Steel ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Volition ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Self Management ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' Stimulus ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' syndrome x ', ' prediabetic ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' waist circumference ', ' meetings ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' self reliance ', ' remote sensing ', ' participatory sensing ', ' Participant ', ' empowerment ', ' Health Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' behavioral health ', ' theories ', ' glucose monitor ', ' glucose meter ', ' glucometer ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' post intervention ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' diabetic management ', ' diabetes management ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' family influence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' successful intervention ', ' follow up assessment ', ' arm ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' cloud based ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile computing ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' Text Messaging ', ' sensing technology ', ' sensor technology ', ' ']",NINR,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,226493,0.058764178793251534
"Risk Behaviors in Preadolescent Boys PROJECT SUMMARY Perceived discrimination is a concrete aspect of racism with well-documented health implications  for people of color in the U.S. Importantly, such health disparities related to perceived  discrimination are clearly evident among Latino youth, the largest racial/ethnic minority segment  of the increasingly diverse American child population and a particularly vulnerable group subjected  to discriminatory treatment. To date, the growing literature on the health implications of  perceived discrimination has not really delved into sexual risk-taking, which is curious given that  it is a key component of Healthy People 2020 and in light of the plethora of research highlighting  the disproportionately higher rates of STDs, HIV/AIDS, and unintended pregnancies afflicting   Latino adolescents. Studying this link in this population, therefore, has significant  public health  relevance, both in terms of promoting sexual health in general and serving the specific needs of  youth of special concern. The purpose of this project – which is based on a successful pilot study  that already addressed many of the practical barriers to studying this topic in this population –  is to test the pathways through with perceived discrimination affects Latino preadolescents’ sexual  risk behaviors and identify culturally congruent developmental processes that support sexual  health. We extended this model to include the role of Latino gender role attitudes (e.g.,  traditional machismo vs. egalitarian or “caballerismo” attitudes) to identify culturally congruent  developmental processes that support sexual health. The study has the following aims: 1) Examine  the link between perceived discrimination and sexual risk behaviors in a sample of low-income  preadolescent Latino boys attending middle schools in Texas; 2) Investigate the mediating role of  psychological distress and substance use on sexual risk behaviors; and, 3) Examine the link between  Latino gender roles (traditional machismo attitudes vs. egalitarian or “caballerismo” attitudes)  and sexual risk behaviors. Studying these links within this age group (11-14) during the sensitive  period of early adolescence, when Latino youth are particularly vulnerable to discrimination, and  before sexual activity becomes common has significant public health relevance, both in terms of  promoting sexual health in general as well as serving the specific needs of Latino youth. An  innovative contribution of this study is that it seeks to map more specific contextual,  behavioral  and cultural pathways onto sexual risk behaviors, which may help identify preadolescents who may  transition to sexual activity early, and can help enhance culturally-based prevention and  intervention programs for Latino adolescents.  The successful completion of this project will lead  to a multi-site R01 proposal to identify cultural resilience pathways to behavioral health outcomes  in a diverse population of youth. The long- term goal of this line of research is to reduce  disparities in negative sexual health outcomes affecting low-SES Latino adolescents and similar  high-risk underserved youth populations.",Risk Behaviors in Preadolescent Boys,9402629,R03HD086600,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' adolescent boy ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Funding ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' expectation ', ' Prevention program ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' theories ', ' junior high school ', ' middle school ', ' junior high ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' sex ', ' Permission ', ' Authorization ', ' Authorization documentation ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Unplanned pregnancy ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' initiation of intercourse ', ' early sexual initiation ', ' early sex initiation ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' early adolescence ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' sexual risk taking ', ' study population ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2018,77361,-0.020668854537030858
"Examining Modifiable Psychosocial Predictors of HIV Seroconversion in a Large Nationwide Cohort of High Risk Men Project Summary Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) remain a population in the U.S. for whom the burden of HIV is high and disproportionate, particularly among younger GBMSM and GBMSM of color, for whom HIV incidence continues to rise despite decades of HIV prevention research to curb the epidemic. However, even among these highest risk groups, risk for infection is not equivalent and the goal of this study is to better understand what factors differentiate levels of risk for HIV infection. Research to date suggests that this disproportionate burden is likely to be exacerbated by psychosocial disparities faced by this population in the form of syndemics and sexual minority stress. However, research on these factors has been limited by a focus on risk for HIV infection operationalized as risk behavior or cross-sectional prevalence of HIV, making actual vulnerability to infection and temporal associations difficult, if not impossible, to determine. We are submitting this application in response to RFA-AI-16-031 Limited Interaction Targeted Epidemiology (LITE) to Advance HIV Prevention (UG3/UH3). We propose to recruit and enroll a large and diverse cohort of approximately 8,000 GBMSM ages 16 and older in the U.S. and Puerto Rico who are at high risk for infection. We will utilize mobile sexual networking applications (“mobile apps”) to identify and enroll these men both to allow for rapid and efficient recruitment and because these apps rapidly increasing in popularity, with research demonstrating that men who use mobile apps are at higher levels of risk for HIV infection than GBMSM recruited through other means. Using this cohort, we will work to achieve three primary aims: (1) we will establish HIV prevalence as well as prevalence of rectal sexually transmitted infections (STIs; gonorrhea and chlamydia) at baseline and subsequently establish rates of HIV and rectal STI incidence among these men 12 months thereafter; (2) we will utilize baseline levels of syndemic, minority stress, and other relevant psychosocial risk factors to develop a model of those modifiable factors that contribute to increased risk for HIV seroconversion (i.e., incidence) as well as rectal STI infection; (3) we will utilize the model to target men in the highest quartile of risk for HIV seroconversion in the cohort and follow them every 6 months thereafter for an additional two years to examine the predictive utility in prospectively predicting HIV seroconversion as well as time to seroconversion. Developing a model of modifiable psychosocial risk factors for actual HIV seroconversion and subsequently testing its reliability and validity in a prospective design has high potential to improve the next generation of HIV prevention interventions aimed at reducing disparities for this population. Project Narrative Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are at disproportionately high risk for HIV infection compared to other groups, but little research has been powered to examine factors associated with their increased susceptibility as measured with biological indicators and prospective HIV serconversion (i.e., incidence). In this study, we will establish a large nationwide cohort of GBMSM at risk for HIV and follow them longitudinally to examine psychosocial predictors of seroconversion. Specifically, we will integrate two prominent psychosocial models of HIV risk for GBMSM—syndemics and minority stress—to identify modifiable targets for future intervention that increase are associated with risk for HIV as measured by rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia infection in addition to actual HIV infection (i.e., seroconversion).",Examining Modifiable Psychosocial Predictors of HIV Seroconversion in a Large Nationwide Cohort of High Risk Men,9531249,UG3AI133674,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Child Sexual Abuse ', ' juvenile sex abuse ', ' childhood sexual abuse ', ' Child Sexual Molestation ', ' Chlamydia ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia Infections ', ' chlamydial disease ', ' Chlamydial Infection ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Color ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Goals ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Puerto Rico ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' rectal ', ' Distal ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Gays ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Anal Sex ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention program ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' high risk ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' sexual minority ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' seroconversion ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIAID,HUNTER COLLEGE,UG3,2018,1527538,0.030931711783501466
"Intimate Partner Violence in Sexual Minority Female Adolescents and Young Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young female sexual minorities (YFSM) are at exceptionally high risk for intimate partner violence (IPV), with over half of YFSM reporting physical or sexual abuse by a dating partner. These young IPV victims may be particularly vulnerable to the negative physical and mental health consequences of IPV, including substance abuse, depression, and suicide, due to minority stress and diminished protective resources (e.g., parent support, community connectedness). In addition, YFSM may be less likely to report and to seek or receive help for IPV because they are not ""out"" about their sexual orientation or they fear stigmatization and discrimination. Women who seek help for same-sex IPV are often denied services (e.g., two-thirds of LGBT IPV survivors were denied access to domestic violence shelters) and feel marginalized and unsupported by domestic violence service systems. Basic research is clearly needed to inform development of culturally sensitive, evidence-based interventions to prevent IPV in YFSM and to support female sexual minority IPV victims. The existing literature, however, has almost exclusively focused on IPV in heterosexuals. Because LGBT teens and young adults face unique issues surrounding their relationships and sexual behaviors (e.g., pressures to deny or conceal sexual identity and activities), the risk and protective factors for IPV, help-seeking behaviors, and consequences of IPV in sexual minority youth are likely quite different from those observed in heterosexual youth. The overarching goal of this project is to begin to address these disparities by conducting an innovative study of IPV in female sexual minority adolescents and young adults (YFSM). We propose a novel, minority stress-informed dynamic developmental systems perspective of IPV in YFSM, which we will test using a mixed-methods, accelerated longitudinal design. Building upon the longest running study of LGBT youth, we will collect quantitative data from two ethnically diverse cohorts of YFSM (N= 530; ages 16-26) every six months for two years, as well as qualitative data from 50 selected participants. We will accomplish the overarching goal with four primary specific aims: (1) Describe the nature and trajectories of IPV in YFSM across adolescence and young adulthood; (2) Identify risk and protective factors for IPV among YFSM, including factors that differentiate violent vs. non-violent/healthy relationships; (3) Examine factors that affect YFSM's reporting of IPV, help-seeking for IPV, and ability to benefit from help provided (e.g., cultural competence of providers); and (4) Evaluate the consequences of IPV in YFSM, identifying factors that raise risk for or protect YFSM victims from revictimization and negative health consequences of IPV. Integration of the resulting quantitative and qualitative data will be used to inform the development of evidence-based interventions to prevent IPV among YFSM and better serve those who experience IPV. 1            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young female sexual minorities experience exceptionally high rates of Intimate partner violence (IPV) and may be particularly vulnerable to subsequent physical and mental health problems. The aims of this study are to describe IPV in female sexual minorities across adolescence and young adulthood, as well as to identify factors that raise risk for or protect against IPV, affect IPV victims' ability to receive appropriate help, and exacerbate or mitigate the negative health consequences of IPV. Data obtained from this project will inform the development of culturally sensitive interventions to reduce the rates of IPV and to better support IPV victims in this vulnerable population.        ",Intimate Partner Violence in Sexual Minority Female Adolescents and Young Adults,9476160,R01HD086170,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Buffers ', ' Communities ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' pressure ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Running ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Shelter facility ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' Injury ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Area ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Domestic Violence ', ' Survivors ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' sexually abused ', ' sex abuse ', ' Sexual abuse ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' cultural competence ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Reporting ', ' emotional abuse ', ' mental abuse ', ' Psychological abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' teenage ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' sex ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' physical abuse ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' twenty-one years of age ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' 21 years of age ', ' 21 year old ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' revictimization ', ' longitudinal design ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' same-sex couple ', ' same sex relationship ', ' same sex partner ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Same-sex ', ' marginalization ', ' social exclusion ', ' violence victimization ', ' violence perpetration ', ' prospective test ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' recruit ', ' service providers ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,R01,2018,548417,0.01631227568850796
"Transwomen, sexual partners and HIV risk Transwomen have an estimated HIV prevalence of 42.4% as of 2013 and there are clear racial/ethnic disparities in HIV risk. HIV prevention among transwomen continues to lag behind research with other key populations. Data on the sexual partners and transmission dynamics in these partnerships may hold the key to effective HIV prevention with transwomen. We propose to conduct a systematic population-based mixed methods study to examine the sexual partnerships of transwomen and identify factors impacting their HIV risk. A barrier to this research is the marginalization of transwomen and their sexual partners creating theoretical and logistical challenges in obtaining inclusive, diverse samples. In this exploratory R21, we propose adaptations of respondent-driven sampling (RDS) to reach 100 transwomen and recruit up to 200 of their sexual partners, capitalizing on RDS' ability to penetrate different, interconnected social groups. We will also conduct a nested qualitative couples study to gather data on ways stigma impacts sexual decision making and risk in partnerships. This proposal offers the field a rare opportunity to determine the partnerships and circumstances defining HIV risk for this key population. The ultimate goal of this research is to determine evidence-based targets for a HIV risk reduction intervention for transwomen and their sexual partners. As such, this study is highly responsive to the National HIV/AIDS strategy need for HIV risk indicators specific to transwomen. This study also falls within the National Institute of Mental Health Division of AIDS Research priorities for advancing the evidence base for interventions beyond the individual level with a focus on high-risk vulnerable populations. This proposal will also maximize the NIH investment in the project by providing data to inform the development of a pilot HIV prevention intervention to reduce HIV risk among transwomen and their sexual partners. Transwomen bear the largest population-specific burden of HIV risk, yet no data have determined precisely why they are at elevated risk. Our study will be the first to engage transwomen’s sexual partners in a population-based systematic study to determine the source and behaviors leading to elevated HIV risk among transwomen. Data gleaned from this study will be used to identify targets for partnership-level interventions and will lead to the submission of a pilot HIV risk reduction intervention focused on transwomen and their sexual partners.","Transwomen, sexual partners and HIV risk",9621189,R21MH118062,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Couples ', ' Decision Making ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Investments ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Methods ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Precipitating Factors ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Glean ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Logistics ', ' Inequality ', ' Respondent ', ' Research Priority ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' preference ', ' intimate behavior ', ' intimacy ', ' social group ', ' Reporting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Collection ', ' sexually transmitted ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' transgender women ', ' gender minority ', ' marginalization ', ' social exclusion ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,PUBLIC HEALTH FOUNDATION ENTERPRISES,R21,2018,173317,0.03703800463998182
"Developing a Dyadic Intervention for STI/HIV Prevention in Youth ABSTRACT  While public health programs have demonstrated modest success in reducing the adolescent and young adult (AYA) risk for STI/HIV, significant health disparities remain. The risk of STI/HIV is not uniform among AYA. AYA residing in segregated urban communities with high STI prevalence and complicated sexual networks face even greater risk for disease and associated complications. Additional supports designed to increase engagement in care and reduce STI acquisition and transmissions are urgently needed to meet the sexual health and reproductive health goals for the nation. Overwhelmingly, AYA STI prevention interventions have targeted individuals and individual-level factors. While effective, these interventions do not adequately address other important influences affecting AYA risk for STI/HIV, such as partner or relationship influences on sexual decision-making and behavior. Partner notification and treatment is a key strategy for disease control and has previously been tested among adults for STI/HIV prevention work but has yet to be evaluated for AYA. Our prior research demonstrates that AYAs with complicated STIs are likely to notify their partners to seek treatment (88-92%); however, AYAs receiving brief behavioral interventions, relative to those receiving standard of care were 3 times more likely to be successful in arranging for their partner's treatment. Thus, partner interventions may hold promise for harnessing the power of relationship dynamics to enhance sexual decision-making, communication, and subsequent health behaviors. We propose to pilot test an intervention designed to change sexual health outcomes by understanding partners and the learning environment related to sex [COUPLES] by simultaneously delivering two evidence-based STI/HIV prevention interventions Sister- to-Sister Teen and Focus on the Future. The simultaneous delivery of effective interventions will be augmented with a joint partner health education counseling session focused on enhancing communication and negotiation of safe sexual practices within the relationship. If successful, this pilot will support the development of a larger trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in the busy primary care setting by providing evidence that AYA can and will safely engage their partners in a supportive primary care setting that integrates high quality treatment with evidence-based STI/HIV prevention interventions delivered by health educator teams. PROJECT NARRARTIVE Sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention strategies for adolescents and young adults (AYA) primarily rely on individual approaches leaving sexual partners with significant unmet sexual and reproductive health needs. Failure to engage AYA partners results in complicated STIs, continued spread of infection, increased risk for HIV acquisition, and index partner reinfection. This pilot project will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of a dyad-based behavioral intervention [COUPLES] that augments individual evidence-based interventions with joint health education counseling for STI-affected AYA dyads within a primary care setting.",Developing a Dyadic Intervention for STI/HIV Prevention in Youth,9552249,R21HD090498,"['Adolescence ',

"The Role of Attentional Processes in the Associations between Syndemics and HIV Risk PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Gay and bisexual men (GBM), and other men who have sex with men continue to account for a significant majority of all new HIV infections in the U.S, with condomless anal sex in the absence of PrEP being the most common HIV transmission risk behavior (TRB). An HIV syndemic has been identified that consists of several epidemics have high levels of comorbidity and work synergistically to increase TRB. These syndemic factors include polydrug use, sexual compulsivity, depression, intimate partner violence, and childhood sexual abuse. Understanding the mechanisms that drive the associations between syndemic factors and TRB is important in developing effective interventions for reducing the HIV burden in this population. The primary goal of this dissertation is to examine three potentially linking mechanisms: emotion regulation, executive attention, and attentional bias. Based on existing research, we hypothesize that these three mechanisms serve as mediators of the associations between syndemic factors and TRB. This R36 dissertation proposal has two aims: (1) Examine the role of emotion regulation and executive attention on the associations between experiences of victimization, drug use, depression, sexual compulsivity, and TRB, and (2): Examine attentional bias for drug- related and sex-related cues and the influence of attentional bias on the associations between drug use, sexual compulsivity, and TRB. To test these aims, we will assess syndemics, emotion regulation, executive attention, attention bias, and TRB in an ongoing NIDA-funded study of syndemics among 1,071 GBM from across the U.S. We will also examine these mechanisms in an original sample of 90 HIV-negative GBM in New York City stratified by sexual compulsivity and polydrug use. The findings from this dissertation study will inform the development of interventions to reduce the burden of HIV among GBM as well as future research. The ultimate goal of this dissertation grant is to launch Mr. Moody’s career as an independent clinical researcher focused on the intersection between substance use, sexual risk behaviors, and mental health among GBM.

"The Role of VGLL3 in Sexually Dimorphic Interferon-Driven Inflammation PROJECT SUMMARY The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator in the field of immune- associated diseases, with a focus on molecular mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphisms in immune disorders. Towards this goal, the career development plan will develop research and professional skills through a combination of research experience, clinical immersion, coursework, and additional professional training activities; all under the mentorship of an interdisciplinary group of experts. Specifically, it focuses on training in: 1) molecular aspects of cutaneous inflammation; 2) animal models for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases; 3) clinical aspects of autoimmune diseases; and 4) communication, collaboration, teaching, writing, and additional faculty skills.  In addition, the completion of the research project in the career development plan will lay the scientific groundwork for the candidate's future research. The research project is summarized below:  Sex disparity in the manifestation of immune diseases represents one of the most remarkable and unexplained examples of the biological differences between men and women. Many autoimmune diseases feature strikingly increased prevalence in females (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus[SLE], female-to-male ratio 9:1), whereas in contrast, infectious diseases affect more men than women.  Our preliminary results suggest that interferon(IFN)-mediated immune responses, key events in host defense and inflammation, exhibit sexual dimorphisms in human keratinocytes in a sex-hormone independent manner. Consistently, the female human skin is biased towards increased expression of genes associated with autoimmune disease susceptibility. These genes are independent of sex-hormone regulation, and are regulated by VGLL3, a female-increased, putative transcription factor. VGLL3 promotes the expression of immune genes, including interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), in a manner that is significantly associated with transcriptomic alterations present in multiple female-biased autoimmune diseases including lupus.  This project aims to identify the molecular basis of sex dimorphisms in IFN responses by testing the hypothesis that higher levels of VGLL3 in females enable priming of ISGs towards sensitized interferon responses and/or delayed recovery from stimulation. To address this we propose the following specific aims:  · Aim 1. Determine sex disparities in transcriptional responses to IFNs and their regulation by VGLL3  · Aim 2. Establish the chromatin mechanism for sex-dependent ISG profiles  · Aim 3. Determine the in vivo role of VGLL3 in regulating IFN-mediated immune processes  With the successful completion of this work, we will have made major advances towards understanding of the molecular basis for sex-dependent immunological processes. This work may also become the basis for novel, sex-specific therapeutic measures for infectious and autoimmune diseases. RELEVANCE By delineating the role of VGLL3 in shaping the sexually dimorphic interferon response, this study is designed to understand the molecular basis of a fundamental difference between men and women in immune regulation. Clinically, it may provide a target and pathway for the prevention and treatment of diseases with aberrant interferon signatures, which will be especially significant for the management of autoimmune diseases, as currently there are no cures or effective preventative measures. It may also shed light on the personalized treatment of immunological diseases in order to address the sex-specific effects of drugs.",The Role of VGLL3 in Sexually Dimorphic Interferon-Driven Inflammation,9504815,K01AR073340,"['Affect ', ' Interferon-alpha ', ' Lymphoblastoid Interferon ', ' Lymphoblast Interferon ', ' Leukocyte Interferon ', ' Interferon-α ', ' Interferon Alfa-n3 ', ' IFNα ', ' IFNa ', ' IFN-α ', ' IFN Alpha ', ' Ginterferon ', ' G-interferon ', ' Alferon ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' anti-virals ', ' anti-viral drugs ', ' anti-viral agents ', ' Antivirals ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Chromatin ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communication ', ' Dendritic Cells ', ' Veiled Cells ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' Diathesis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Exhibits ', ' Faculty ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Histones ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immersion Investigative Technique ', ' Immersion ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' Immunological System Dysfunction ', ' Immunological Dysfunction ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immunodeficiency and Immunosuppression Disorders ', ' Immune System and Related Disorders ', ' Immune System Dysfunction ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' In Vitro ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interferon Type II ', ' lFN-Gamma ', ' Interferon-gamma ', ' Interferon Gamma ', ' Immune Interferon ', ' IFNγ ', ' IFNG ', ' IFN-γ ', ' IFN-g ', ' IFN-Gamma ', ' Gamma interferon ', ' Interferons ', ' IFN ', ' keratinocyte ', ' Kinetics ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE -

"HIV Education for African American Men PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  One in 16 Black men will be diagnosed with HIV in his lifetime as compared to 1 in 102 White men. Nearly 15% of these new HIV cases among African American men are due to heterosexual transmission. Despite this, Black men who have sex with women (MSW) have received very little empirical attention. This is a missed public health opportunity. First, Black men do not routinely use condoms, one of the most effective ways to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV, indicating the potential for substantial behavioral impact. And second, 80% of new HIV infections in African American women are due to sex with men. The intra-racial nature of sexual networks suggests most of these women are infected by Black men. Thus, reducing HIV incidence among Black men should concomitantly reduce HIV disparities among African American women.  The female condom (FC) is an alternative HIV protection method that may overcome a key barrier to male condom use: reduced sexual pleasure. Research shows that Black women respond well to FC education, but gender norms may impede their efforts to introduce FCs to male partners. One way to overcome this is to provide FC training directly to men. Indeed, preliminary research has shown that men report fewer unprotected sex partners after receiving both female and male condom training. In addition, men endorse several benefits to FC use, including that they provide greater sexual sensation than male condoms.  To harness the potential of FCs for Black MSW, we intend to develop Focus, a computer-based HIV behavioral intervention for heterosexually active African American men that provides training in male and female condom use. Focus will computer-enable the core components of Focus on the Future (FOF), the only best-evidence HIV behavioral intervention for Black MSW. The one-hour FOF session addresses the correct and consistent use of male condoms and lubricants, condom negotiation, and the importance of protecting one's future. FOF's main message is that there are many types of condoms and lubricants and men should experiment to find the ones that make sex feel best. By providing FCs as an additional option, Focus aims to lessen the impact of a major barrier to condom uptake: reduced sexual pleasure. Another barrier to Black MSW's HIV risk reduction behavior is belief in a traditional masculine ideology. Black men who espouse these views are more likely to engage in sexual risk behavior. To counteract this, Focus will provide methods to reframe potentially dangerous masculine beliefs into healthier sexual and relationship behaviors.  The results of Phase I strongly support the feasibility and potential effectiveness of Focus, far exceeding the established benchmarks. In Phase II, we will complete development of Focus and test its effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial with 120 African American MSW. Participants will be randomly assigned to either receive the Focus program or the attention control materials. Before, and at two points after random assignment, condom use behaviors as well as condom skills, attitudes, and partner negotiation will be assessed. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop a computer-based HIV prevention program for African American men who have sex with women (MSW) that includes education and training about female and male condoms. The computer- based program will allow clinics to provide an empirically validated HIV prevention intervention to their clients without creating additional demands on their already overburdened staff. The skills contained in this program will help African American MSW protect themselves from sexual HIV risk, with the ultimate goal of reducing health disparities in HIV incidence.",HIV Education for African American Men,9531916,R44HD081992,"['Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Client ', ' Computers ', ' Male Condoms ', ' Consultations ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterosexuality ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Learning ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Esthesia ', ' Sensation ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Female Condoms ', ' Masculine ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Lifestyle Risk Reduction ', ' Risk Reduction Behavior ', ' uptake ', ' Lubricants ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Clinic ', ' Test Result ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' pleasure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Manufacturer Name ', ' Manufacturer ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Interruption ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' sexual relationship ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' prototype ', ' FDA approved ', ' sexual HIV transmission ', ' attentional control ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NICHD,"ISA ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2018,236033,0.10914636944587541
"Strong Men, Strong Communities: Cultural Tradition to Improve Native Men's Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indian (AI) males experience profound health disparities compared to their counterparts in all other U.S. racial and ethnic groups. For example, AI men have the highest age-adjusted prevalence of type 2 diabetes (~18 percent) among U.S. men, while non-Hispanic White men have the lowest (~7 percent). In recent decades, AIs have seen a disproportionate increase in diabetes-related complications and mortality compared to all other groups, such that age-adjusted diabetes death rates in AI men are now almost twice those in White men. Several large randomized, controlled trials in non-AIs confirm that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed by interventions that promote healthy lifestyles, but little empirical data exist on interventions to prevent diabetes in AI men. In the clinic-based U.S. Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), only 55 out of 3,234 participants were AI men. Similarly, in the diabetes prevention programs in Native communities, participation by AI males is low, ranging from 33 percent to 74 percent. Many explanations have been posited for the low participation rates among men of all races in lifestyle interventions. Recruiting AI men in clinic-based programs is difficult because they tend to seek clinical care less often than women. AI men's perceptions of normative health behaviors and gender roles may also discourage participation, particularly in mixed-gender groups. Therefore, an urgent need exists for diabetes risk reduction programs tailored to the unique values and habits of AI men, with a particular focus on recruitment and retention.  We are collaborating with the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe (Minnesota), the Indian Health Board of Minneapolis (Minnesota), and Yakama Nation and Heritage University Center for Native American Health and Culture (Washington) to develop the Strong Men, Strong Communities (SMSC) program. This is a culturally appropriate approach for AI men that targets modifiable diabetes risk factors. It uses methods adapted from successful, non-clinic based programs for other high-risk minority populations, and it incorporates elements of DPP and SDPI-DP. Our Specific Aims are to:  1) Refine the SMSC intervention with feedback from focus groups in our 3 partner communities.  2) Compare change in diabetes risk score (primary outcome) and modifiable diabetes risk factors (secondary outcomes) in the SMSC intervention and wait-list control groups.  3) Evaluate the ability of SMSC to retain 80 percent of 240 AI male participants, 21-65 years of age with no previous diagnosis of diabetes. The proposed study fills a striking gap in approaches to increase recruitment and participation in lifestyle programs that reduce diabetes risk in AI men. The proposed study will have broad implications for the ongoing epidemic of AI obesity and diabetes. Given the need to increase AI men's participation in lifestyle interventions, our findings might have substantial public health impact on tribal communities across the U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health disparities experienced by American Indian (AI) men compared to AI women and other racial/ethnic groups are striking and the gap is worsening. AI men have a higher prevalence of obesity, diabetes and a higher diabetes-related mortality rate than White men, yet infrequently participate in lifestyle interventions. Our lifestyle intervention could have broad implications given the epidemic of obesity and diabetes among AI men and help identify strategies to increase AI male participation in interventions to reduce the risk for diabetes.","Strong Men, Strong Communities: Cultural Tradition to Improve Native Men's Health",9525962,R01DK102728,"['Individual ', ' Native Americans ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' good diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' Healthy diet ', ' waist circumference ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' experience ', ' advanced disease ', ' advanced illness ', ' Participant ', ' Indian reservation ', ' tribal reservation ', ' reservation community ', ' native american reservation ', ' nation reservation ', ' American Indian reservation ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Drops ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Indigenous ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' cost ', ' community intervention ', ' Mille Lacs Band ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Ojibwe ', ' tribal communities ', ' tribal community ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' male group ', "" men's group "", "" men's health "", ' male health ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' community setting ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' retention rate ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Yakama ', ' Yakama Indian ', ' recruit ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Animals ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Control Groups ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Feedback ', ' Fishes ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Perception ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Thinness ', ' Leanness ', ' Universities ', ' Vegetables ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Washington ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Woman ', ' Bison ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Death Rate ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' ']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,460779,0.040191217013964414
"Health Effects of Identity-based Stressors Among Men Project Summary Health disparities among sexual and gender minority people exist across the lifespan, and are increasingly well-documented, yet gaps remain in our basic understanding of how health varies within these groups. This was emphasized in the Institute of Medicine's 2011 report on LGBT health, which pointed specifically to the need for more research among bisexual populations. While bisexual men experience notable health disparities related to both outcomes and access to care, we know very little about the unique risk factors that bisexual- identified men experience. The minority stress model posits that minority groups face stressors associated with their minority status that are unique and additive to everyday life stressors. The majority of work related to sexual minority stressors and health has presumed that experiences of lesbian, gay and bisexual groups are the same. Additionally, there is little work assessing the health effects of daily-level, identity-based stressors and health among SGM populations. The proposed study will address these gaps in the literature, using a novel, multi-method approach. Through qualitative interviews, use of daily electronic diaries over 28 consecutive days, and survey measures, we will test the hypothesis that racially diverse bisexual men who more frequently report microaggressions will have poorer mental and physical health outcomes than bisexual men who less frequently report microaggressions. Aims are: 1)Identify the characteristics of racially diverse bisexual men's microaggressive experiences, e.g., context, content and source, including their responses to such experiences; 2) Determine the frequency and source of sexual orientation and racial/ethnic microaggressions among bisexual men and test their association(s) with daily mental and physical health; 3) Assess lifetime stressors that may influence associations between MAs and daily and lifetime mental and physical health. This study is a companion to a similar study among bisexual women, and will allow for cross- gender comparisons. This preliminary exploration of within-group differences can significantly advance our knowledge of the risk factors associated with health disparities among racially diverse bisexual men. Findings will be critical for informing directions for future research and practice through the identification of relevant research questions and/or foci for preventative interventions. Project Narrative Bisexual men experience numerous health disparities in comparison to other men, related to both mental and physical health, as well as access to care. These inequities create a public health burden through both their economic, as well as social, costs. This project will identify potential risk factors unique to racially/ethnically diverse bisexual men, and assist in determining the focus for future intervention and prevention programming.",Health Effects of Identity-based Stressors Among Men,9572418,R21MD012319,"['Affect ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Life Experience ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' Latino ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Caring ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Exposure to ', ' Companions ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' care seeking ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' deprivation ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' sexual minority ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R21,2018,199302,0.0803245836850783
"Designing an Intervention to Increase Men's Linkage to Care and Prevention after HIV Self-Testing in Uganda PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The success of HIV treatment and prevention in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is hindered by the gender disparity in access to care. Men in SSA are less likely to undergo HIV testing and more likely to start antiretroviral treatment (ART) at advanced disease stages compared to women, resulting in poorer clinical outcomes. HIV self-testing (HIVST) is shown to be an innovating and empowering method to increase HIV testing coverage in men. In particular, secondary distribution of HIV self-tests to men from their female partners has achieved high uptake in men. However, men’s linkage to care after HIVST is not well evaluated. As clinic linkage is a crucial step to accessing lifesaving ART and prevention including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), the success of HIVST interventions in reducing HIV burden hinges on their ability to link individuals to care. The goal of this K01 Award is to broaden the candidate’s expertise to conduct independent research in global HIV prevention, with a focus on optimizing HIVST and linkage strategies. To complete this research, the candidate will develop new competencies in 1) qualitative research and behavioral science, 2) behavioral economics, and 3) implementation science. These skills build nicely on the candidate’s current proficiencies in epidemiology, mathematical modeling, and cost-effectiveness analyses. This newly developed skillset will enable the candidate to design, evaluate, and adapt locally relevant and scalable HIV interventions to reduce HIV burden in SSA. The candidate has assembled a robust, multidisciplinary mentorship team to guide her research and career development. The research will be conducted in Kampala, Uganda, within a Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) clinic. This is an ideal setting in which to evaluate the effectiveness of secondary distribution of HIV self-tests. Pregnant women commonly report not knowing the HIV-status of their male partner. Furthermore, testing partners of HIV-positive women is a high yield strategy to identify HIV-positive men in need of ART as well as HIV-negative men serodiscordant partnerships who can benefit from PrEP and VMMC. Interviews will be conducted with men regarding their barriers and motivators for linkage and with providers/stakeholders regarding the feasibility of integrating the potential interventions into clinic practice (Aim 1). Using the intervention characteristics identified in Aim 1, the candidate will create and administer a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) to men with HIV-positive female partners (Aim 2). The DCE elicit characteristics of men’s preferred HIVST intervention, which will be used to develop a tailored intervention for optimal uptake. Finally, the candidate will pilot-test the optimal HIV-self testing intervention to 50 pregnant women starting PMTCT and their male partners. She will evaluate the intervention’s acceptability and effectiveness in linking men to confirmatory HIV testing, treatment and prevention (Aim 3). This research is the first to evaluate an intervention to motivate male linkage to care after HIV self-testing. It has the potential to identify strategies to increase HIV testing and linkage to care in SSA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT (PROJECT NARRATIVE) Men in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are less likely than women to test for HIV and link to treatment and prevention, resulting in poorer clinical outcomes. Innovate HIV self-testing strategies demonstrate high male uptake and have the potential to increase HIV testing coverage, but methods to link men to care after HIV self-testing are not well evaluated.

"Young Men of Color Who Have Sex with Men Cohort Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  U01 - Cohort Study with Young Men of Color who have Sex with Men In this fourth decade of the HIV epidemic, we continue to see 50,000 new infections annually in the U.S., particularly among Black/African American and Latino young men who have sex with men (YMSM of color), who now account for 60% of new infections among Black/African American MSM and 45% of new infections among Latino MSM. Black/African American YMSM remain five times more likely to be HIV seropositive, seven times more likely to have an undiagnosed HIV infection, and 45% more likely to be diagnosed with an STI than other YMSM. YMSM of color are also the least likely to seek and remain in HIV/AIDS care, and when they do seek care, they typically already have advanced HIV disease. Among youth who initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART), 54% will achieve viral suppression; unfortunately 57% will not be retained in care and less than 6% will remain virally suppressed. Changing the course of this epidemic is going to require a dramatically different approach to prevention. We are therefore proposing to conduct longitudinal research with a large and diverse cohort of 450 YMSM of color in order to prevent new HIV infections, reduce transmission, and reduce HIV/AIDS-related disparities by focusing on successful engagement in care. Building on the HIV Continuum of Care and Prevention paradigm (i.e., seek, test, treat, and retain in care) and the Syndemic Theory of Risk, we will use a mixed-methods study design to collect and analytically triangulate quantitative, qualitative, and biological measures at baseline and every six months. Participants will be recruited from public venues, HIV test sites, and HIV/AIDS clinics using randomized probability and purposeful sampling designs. All participants will be tracked to ensure a retention rate of 90% or better, which is a feasible target given our retention rates of 94% in the Healthy Young Men's (HYM) Study. The specific aims are to 1) better understand and operationally define what linkage, engagement, retention to care (both primary health and HIV/AIDS treatment) and adherence means to HIV- and HIV+ YMSM of color; 2) characterize and monitor over time YMSM of color's use of alcohol and illicit drugs; utilization of HIV testing and prevention services; incidence of HIV and STIs; insurance status and access to health care services, including primary care and HIV/AIDS treatment services; engagement in and utilization of health care and HIV/AIDS treatment services; retention in HIV/AIDS care and adherence to ART; and utilization of biomedical interventions, such as PrEP and PEP; and 3) identify barriers/facilitator of engagement along the HIV Continuum of Care and Prevention. The proposed research builds on close to two decades of NIH-funded research by our team focused on this and other high-risk youth populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is an urgent need to address increasing rates of HIV/AIDS among high-risk Black, Latino and multiracial young men who have sex with men in Los Angeles. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to develop new interventions designed to reduce HIV/STI risk and transmission, reduce HIV/AIDS disease progression, and improve the health and quality of life of HIV+ young men. This research will also inform the development of new HIV service delivery models given that the U.S. is now reevaluating all models of care under the auspices of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and

"Effect of Sex Hormones on HIV persistence ABSTRACT. Problem. There are distinct sex-based differences that affect the natural history of HIV infection and HIV- specific immune responses. These differences are partially driven by sex hormones (estrogens in particular) and might influence the size, distribution and transcriptional activity of the HIV reservoirs. Unfortunately, cis- gender women represent only 11% of all participants recruited to HIV cure research and there is a significant knowledge gap between the biology of HIV cure in men and women. Even less is known about the effect of exogenous sex hormones on the viral reservoir and immune response in HIV-infected transgender women. What we know now. One study including >500 HIV-infected participants on antiretroviral therapy (ART) found that women have on average significantly lower levels of HIV DNA in peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMC) than men. Various in vitro studies reported sex-based differences on HIV infection and replication in target cells. These differences are partially driven by estrogens that inhibit HIV transcription, through estrogen receptor-dependent mechanisms. Our proposed solution. We will prospectively enroll 15 HIV-infected transgender women (“male-to-female”) on ART with suppressed HIV RNA for >12 months, who plan to start estradiol-based hormonal therapy (HT). We will follow this cohort for 12 months. We will collect longitudinal blood samples before and after initiation of HT. We are uniquely positioned to recruit this “hard-to-reach” population thanks to our collaboration with “The Night Clinic” in San Diego, which is following >400 unique transgender women, 40% of whom are HIV-positive. Our goal. We will characterised extensively the HIV reservoir and generate immunological data at each time- point. We will use these data to determine the effect of sex hormones and receptor expression (in particular estradiol) on the HIV reservoir size and transcriptional activity over 12 months of follow-up while on suppressive ART. Historical data from a similar cohort of HIV-infected men (matched by baseline HIV DNA levels, age, CD4+ cells, time on ART and duration of HIV infection) will be used as a comparison. How will we advance the field. Transgender women are disproportionately impacted by HIV in the United States and worldwide and face overwhelming disparities. There is urgent need to include transgender women in the HIV cure agenda, and to adapt curative approaches to meet the unique needs of this specific population. Investigating the effect of estradiol-based HT on the HIV reservoir size and transcriptional activity in transgender women will provide the unique opportunity to the isolate the effect of estradiol on HIV transcription. Narrative There are distinct sex-based differences that affect the natural history and immune pathogenesis of HIV infection. These factors likely impact the establishment, distribution and transcriptional activity of the HIV reservoir. Our study is designed to determine the effect of sex hormones and receptor expression on the HIV reservoir size and transcriptional activity during suppressive antiretroviral therapy in transgender women starting estradiol-based hormonal therapy.",Effect of Sex Hormones on HIV persistence,9511732,R21AI134295,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Androgens ', ' Therapeutic Androgen ', ' Androgenic Compounds ', ' Androgenic Agents ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biology ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Cells ', ' Peripheral Blood Cell ', ' Cell Count ', ' Cell Number ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Distributional Activity ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' ELISA ', ' Estradiol ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Female ', ' Flow Cytometry ', ' flow cytophotometry ', ' Flow Microfluorometry ', ' Flow Microfluorimetry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometry ', ' Flow Cytofluorometries ', ' Goals ', ' Histone Deacetylase ', ' HDAC Proteins ', ' HDAC ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Hormone Receptor ', ' In Vitro ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Progesterone ', ' Therapeutic Progesterone ', ' Pregnenedione ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione ', ' Delta4-pregnene-3,20-dione ', ' Corpus Luteum Hormone ', ' Prolactin ', ' luteotropin ', ' luteotropic hormone ', ' Pituitary Mammotropic Hormone ', ' Pituitary Lactogenic Hormone ', ' Mammotropin ', ' Estrogen Receptors ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' sex steroid ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Lymphocytes ', ' T4 Cells ', ' CD4-Positive Lymphocytes ', ' CD4+ T-Lymphocyte ', ' CD4 lymphocyte ', ' CD4 helper T cell ', ' CD4 T cells ', ' CD4 Cells ', ' Testosterone ', ' Trans-Testosterone ', ' Therapeutic Testosterone ', ' Time ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' Upregulation ', ' virology ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Mediating ', ' Natural History ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Clinic ', ' therapy duration ', ' Viral ', ' receptor expression ', ' cohort ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' PBMC ', ' Vorinostat ', ' suberanilohydroxamic acid ', ' Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid ', ' SAHA ', ' Participant ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' Data ', ' Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor ', ' Histone deacetylase inhibition ', ' HDAC inhibitor ', ' HDAC Agent ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Immunologically ', ' Immunological ', ' Immunologic ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Immunologics ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' T cell response ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' transgender women ', ' Virus reservoir ', ' Viral reservoir ', ' cisgender ', ' disenfranchised group ', ' disenfranchised population ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2018,193750,-0.017219579247197272
"Center for Point-of-Care Technologies Research for Sexually Transmitted Diseases Project Summary The long-term goals of our center include addressing the epidemics of STDs/HIV in the U.S. and in resource-poor settings by development and better use of Point-of-Care (POC) tests, so as to address health inequity and improve the sexual health of individuals. Our specific aims are: 1. To develop a “Center of Excellence for the Development and Testing of Point of Care Tests (POCT) for Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)” with cores that can: drive the development and application of point-of-care technologies via collaborative efforts that merge scientific and technological capabilities with clinical need and training of developers, as well as end users of POCT. 2. To use clinical drivers of technology progression for developing and expanding existing POC STD technologies, by providing assistance and feed back in an iterative fashion to developers in a “go-no go” manner, such that we insure that deliverables for each project are met. 3. To implement functioning core components that work smoothly together in a collaborative fashion and with other members of the Point-of-Care Technologies Research Network (POCTRN), which can work with our administrative component to implement a smooth transition along a pipeline from developmental prototype assays through early in- house, clinical translation and validation testing, In this coordinated manner, we can assist with the logical development of POC assays, which prove to have qualifications of sufficient scientific merit and can progress towards eventual FDA submission and commercialization.  These goals and aims will be accomplished by an effective administrative component, ascertaining needs of users of POC, training of scientists, funding scientists and engineers for development of prototype and mature POC technologies, and pilot testing and implementation of POC tests in diverse clinical settings, which will lead to the commercialization and use of POC tests for diagnosing STDs in order to improve the sexual health of individuals in the United States and the rest of the world. Narrative Overall Component The relevance of this project to public health is that by use of Point-of Care tests to rapidly and accurately diagnose sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), the sexual health of individuals in both the U.S. and in resource poor settings throughout the world will be improved.

"Project PRIDE: Intervention to Reduce HIV risk in Young Sexual Minority Men PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Young gay and bisexual men are disproportionately affected by HIV, accounting for the majority of new HIV cases among youth. Young gay and bisexual men face specific challenges that increase their risk for HIV transmission. These challenges include the stress associated with having a stigmatized non-heterosexual identity and the negative health outcomes associated with this stress, including alcohol and drug use, condomless sex, and poor mental health. There is a need to develop and test interventions that target these specific risk factors in order to prevent HIV transmission among young gay and bisexual men. The purpose of the proposed project is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of a novel, theory-based primary HIV- prevention intervention. This intervention, entitled Project PRIDE (Promoting Resilience In Discriminatory Environments), consists of 8 sessions and is delivered to young gay and bisexual men aged 18-25. Project PRIDE focuses on the development of adaptive coping strategies to deal with gay/bisexual-related stress in order to reduce alcohol and drug use, condomless sex, and mental health problems. The specific aims of the proposed project are to (1) randomize 123 racially/ethnically-diverse, HIV-negative young gay and bisexual men to one of two conditions: either the intervention condition, which will receive Project PRIDE immediately, or the wait-list control condition, which will wait approximately 5 months before receiving Project PRIDE, and (2) test the feasibility of obtaining biological measures of stress, drug use, and HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs; i.e., syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia), including saliva samples to assess the stress hormone cortisol, urine samples to assess drug use, and urine/blood/oral swabs to assess HIV and other STIs. To meet these aims, we will recruit participants in Houston, TX, through a health services agency and through study advertisements targeted to venues, both physical and virtual, frequented by young gay and bisexual men. Eligible participants will complete self-report measures, including sexual behavior, mental health, and coping, among others, in addition to biological measures. The effects of the intervention will be examined immediately after the conclusion of Project PRIDE and again 3 months later in both the intervention condition and the wait-list control condition. Study results will be used to inform a subsequent NIH application to test the efficacy of a large-scale randomized controlled trial in reducing condomless sex, drug and alcohol use, and negative mental health outcomes among young gay and bisexual men. Moreover, the results have important implications for public health and have the potential to reduce drug use, mental health problems, and HIV risk among a population at high risk for negative health outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men are overrepresented among new HIV cases, with HIV incidence rates increasing among young gay and bisexual men. As such, there is a need to develop effective HIV-prevention interventions that target young gay and bisexual men and focus on reducing their particular risk factors for HIV. The proposed project will pilot test a randomized controlled trial of a psychoeducational intervention for young gay and bisexual men that focuses on developing adaptive coping strategies to reduce substance use, HIV risk behaviors, and negative mental health outcomes.",Project PRIDE: Intervention to Reduce HIV risk in Young Sexual Minority Men,9471376,R21DA041250,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', '

"Epidemiology of Obesity, Diabetes, and Hypertension in African Caribbeans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Obesity is a very strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension, which disproportionately affect African ancestry populations. The Caribbean region in particular is experiencing an enormous epidemic of cardio-metabolic disease, with obesity, T2D, and hypertension being considerably higher in African Caribbeans compared to Caribbeans of other race/ethnicities. Despite the current and projected growth in obesity, T2D and hypertension among African Caribbeans, the mechanisms underlying racial/ethnic disparities in these devastating and costly conditions remain largely unknown. T2D and hypertension are driven in part by obesity and body fat distribution, especially fat around and within non-adipose tissue organs (known as ectopic adiposity). Our recent discovery that ectopic skeletal muscle adiposity contributes to incident T2D and hypertension in African Caribbean men supports the hypothesis that ectopic adiposity may be a key risk factor contributing to increased risk of T2D and hypertension in African Caribbean populations. However, in contrast to African Caribbean men, very little is known about the importance of body fat distribution and ectopic adiposity for T2D, hypertension, and resultant cardiovascular disease in African Caribbean women. Our preliminary data underscores the need to extend research to include African Caribbean women to unravel the sex-specific and obesity-related mechanisms for T2D, hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to discover novel factors related to these major conditions in African ancestry populations. Over the past 20 years we have been studying a unique population-based cohort of African Caribbean men from Tobago. We now propose to expand our research on obesity, T2D, hypertension, and CVD among African Caribbean men to include African Caribbean women in Tobago. We will collect data on lifestyle and medical factors, anthropometrics, DXA and CT body composition measures, carotid ultrasound measures of subclinical cardiovascular disease, and create a specimen biobank for future proposals using our existing infrastructure and well-established procedures. In these newly recruited women, we propose to: 1) determine the overall, and age- and BMI- specific prevalence of T2D and hypertension in African Caribbean women in Tobago, and compare the prevalence with our existing data in men; 2) identify traditional and novel lifestyle, cultural, behavioral, reproductive, nutritional, and medical-related risk factors for T2D and hypertension among African Caribbean women, and 3) evaluate the association of body fat distribution and ectopic adiposity in African Caribbean women with prevalent T2D and hypertension, and compare these associations with those previously observed in African Caribbean men. In addition to accomplishing these aims, the collection and archiving of vital specimens and measures (e.g., fecal samples for microbial distribution; DNA and RNA extraction for omics based approaches), and reading of archived vascular images for subclinical CVD will create the foundation for subsequent, focused funding proposals. Finally, combined with our existing data in men, our study will provide a rich resource for the long-term study of cardio-metabolic health among African Caribbeans and enable future comparisons to similarly phenotyped cohorts of African Americans.

Our study will have a substantial impact on the field by providing new insight on of cardio-metabolic disease in a high-risk, African Caribbean population, and will enable future comparisons to similar cohorts of African Americans.","Epidemiology of Obesity, Diabetes, and Hypertension in African Caribbeans",9599762,R01HL143793,"['Adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' white adipose

"Siempre Seguiré: A Pilot Intervention to Improve Coping with Discrimination and Adherence among HIV-Positive Latino MSM PROJECT SUMMARY HIV-related disparities in diagnosis and disease outcomes persist among Latinos, and Latinos living with HIV show a lower percentage of viral suppression compared to the general HIV-positive population. A growing body of work suggests that stigma and discrimination contribute to health disparities, especially among people living with HIV, who may experience discrimination due to multiple stigmatized identities related to HIV- serostatus, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Internalized stigma and discrimination may lead to health- related disparities by increasing detrimental physiological stress responses, resulting in maladaptive coping and poor health behaviors, including non-adherence to treatment. Moreover, the chronic stress of discrimination may weaken immune function, leading to worse HIV outcomes, including increased HIV viral load. In the proposed research, we will integrate adherence skills-building strategies into a recently developed intervention, Siempre Seguiré, a 7-session group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention for HIV- positive Latino men who have sex with men (LMSM) that aims to improve adaptive coping responses to discrimination. In a small pilot of 30 participants, the intervention was associated with improved coping at follow-up as compared to baseline. However, this pilot did not include a control group, did not address or examine HIV-related behaviors and outcomes such as adherence, retention in care, and viral load suppression, and had a very low sample size. Thus, in the proposed research, we will conduct a larger pilot study in which preliminary effects on HIV outcomes can be assessed. The specific aims are: (1) To modify and refine Siempre Seguiré, a newly developed culturally congruent CBT group intervention for HIV-positive LMSM, to include strategies for antiretroviral treatment adherence and retention in HIV care; and (2) To conduct a small randomized pilot of Siempre Seguiré to examine feasibility and acceptability, as well as to explore preliminary effects on: (a) coping responses to discrimination; and (b) antiretroviral treatment adherence, viral load suppression, and HIV care retention, among LMSM living with HIV. In Phase 1, we will work with HIV treatment adherence intervention experts and key stakeholders, including a community advisory board, to refine our pilot intervention as needed and update our manual to integrate information and skills building regarding HIV treatment adherence and retention in care. In Phase 2, we will conduct a small randomized controlled trial of 80 participants (40 intervention participants divided evenly over 4 intervention groups vs. 40 wait-list control participants). To our knowledge, our study will be the first to test an intervention that addresses coping with discrimination from multiple identities. Our proposed research is consistent with the Institute of Medicine report, The Health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People, which recommends developing interventions to address racial disparities and mental health effects of discrimination among sexual minorities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Latinos in the U.S., especially those who are men who have sex with men, show HIV-related disparities, tending to be diagnosed at a later disease stage, leading to delays in care entry and antiretroviral treatment use, and lower rates of viral suppression. No culturally congruent interventions have been developed to address stress resulting from discrimination, a key contributor to disparities in HIV outcomes among Latino men who have sex with men.

"Influences on risk behaviors among young men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate. I pursue this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) to facilitate my transition towards an independent research career in HIV prevention science. My long-term goal is to become a productive independent HIV prevention behavioral scientist. My goals include the development of HIV prevention interventions - using new and increasingly accessible and influential online media - to address disparities among sexual minority populations across key developmental periods. To date, my training has focused on core strengths and skills in clinical psychology (PhD) and epidemiology (MPH). I have acquired expertise in HIV prevention, behavior change theory, and research methods, with an emphasis on adults. This foundation has prepared me for the proposed next steps of my training, namely, developing expertise in adolescent risk behavior (the time when most risk behavior patterns are established) and the skills necessary for the development, implementation, and evaluation of online prevention interventions and research.  Training plan. The proposed training plan will prepare me to work with adolescent sexual minority populations, a group at significant risk for HIV. Receipt of a K23 award will allow me protected time to acquire the necessary skills. Specifically, with the K23 training I will: (1) acquire the theoretical and methodological skills required for HIV prevention interventions targeting sexual minority populations during adolescence; (2) gain hands-on training in online media-based intervention development, including health communications and media literacy skills; and (3) build the necessary collaboration networks and research infrastructure to enable independence as an NIH-funded investigator. Importantly my training will also increase my sophistication regarding the (4) unique ethical challenges involved in (a) working with a young, often stigmatized population, and (b) delivering online interventions. Both domains are fraught with ethical complexities (e.g., privacy, consent, confidentiality) at a time of rapidly-evolving societal, cultural, health, and technological changes. My training will prepare me to take a leadership role in this emerging and complex research area. Training goals will be achieved through didactic courses, workshops, research experience, and mentoring.  Environment. During the proposed K23, I will be a Research Scientist at The Miriam Hospital and an Assistant Professor at Brown University. At the Miriam, I will have access to the outstanding and highly supportive research environments provided by the Centers for Behavioral and Preventive Medicine and the Centers for AIDS Research. At Brown University, I will have access to the academic resources of the Schools of Medicine and Public Health, including the Alcohol Research Center on HIV. This environment will enhance my training and facilitate my research goals. Through the training, experience, and skills gained as a part of this K23 Award, I will be prepared to pursue funding to conduct a larger randomized controlled trial of an intervention to reduce HIV risk among adolescent sexual minority populations.  Mentors. I will receive mentoring from an outstanding team of internationally recognized and accomplished investigators in HIV prevention and behavioral science, public health, communications, and media literacy.  Proposed research. Young sexual minority males account for a disproportionate number of HIV infections in the United States. Racial and ethnic minority populations are particularly affected. Incidence rates reflect sexual risk behaviors during early sexual experiences. Research suggests that initial sexual risk-taking occurs during adolescence (ages 14-18) among sexual minority males. Therefore, it is important for HIV prevention interventions to target adolescent sexual minority males. Targeting sexual minority males during adolescence will help them learn and establish healthy sexual behaviors early in their psychosexual development, which will have both immediate and long-term health benefits.  Online media use triggers and maintains sexual risk-taking among adolescent sexual minority males. Consequently, it is critical for HIV prevention interventions to address the influence of online media on this population. One way to address this influence is by developing an online sexual health media literacy intervention. To promote adolescent sexual minority males' critical examination of online media and to decrease their sexual risk-taking, I propose a two-stage program of research (i.e., formative research and an exploratory clinical trial) with three aims: (1) develop methods to recruit and retain a racially/ethnically diverse sample of adolescent sexual minority males online using feedback from five focus groups (N ~ 30); (2) develop a brief, online-administered, sexual health media literacy intervention to lower HIV risk behaviors among adolescent sexual minority males using information from a youth advisory board (N ~ 8) and a cross-sectional online survey (N = 200); and (3) conduct an exploratory clinical trial to pilot test the developed online sexual health media literacy intervention for feasibility and acceptability (N = 100). Overall, the proposed research has the potential to reach a wide audience of sexual minority males early in their sexual development, ultimately decreasing their sexual risk-taking and reducing the number of new HIV infections in this population. Further, the proposed research will expand my capacities as an HIV researcher and interventionist and place me at the forefront of online media-based HIV prevention research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescent sexual minority males account for a disproportionate number of new HIV infections in the United States. There is an urgent need for innovative prevention methods for this at-risk group. The proposed research will take advantage the Internet to reach this group - often hidden and difficult to access - early in their development in order to provide them with prevention programming to help them learn and establish healthy sexual behaviors.",Influences on risk behaviors among young men,9430468,K23MH109346,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency

"Surviving the HIV Epidemic (S/HE) in metropolitan Washington DC - Advancing knowledge through cohort studies ABSTRACT About 1.1 million people are living with HIV (PLWH) in the US, with an estimated 39,782 individuals newly diagnosed with HIV in 2016. The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) are two of the longest standing HIV cohort studies in the United States. Established in 1984 and 1993, respectively, these US-based cohorts currently follow 2,235 men and 2,304 women living with HIV, alongside high-risk but uninfected controls. HIV is at epidemic proportions in the nation’s capital, with overall HIV prevalence of 1.9% among the District of Columbia (DC) adult and adolescent residents. Approximately 3.7% of DC residents aged 40 to 49 years and 5.2% of residents aged 50 to 59 years are living with HIV. The highest life time risk of acquiring HIV in the U.S. is highest in DC with an estimated 1 in 17 individuals anticipated to acquire HIV in their lifetime, followed by 1 in 56 risk among the neighboring Maryland residents. Continuing to follow the women we have recruited and expanding our cohort to include a representative group of men and women is imperative in this region with epidemic levels of HIV. Our research will be focused on understanding the behavioral and social determinants that contribute to long term treatment success and failure, with a focus on identifying key resilience factors that may translate into innovative interventions to achieve the global goals of the HIV care continuum, to improve treatment uptake and viral suppression to decrease morbidity and mortality. We have four aims to achieve our goals. (1) To continue our strong collaborative relationship with the national MACS/WIHS CCS in protocol development, implementation, participant enrollment, retention, data acquisition, and sub-study participation; (2) To lead the CCS-wide effort to understand the psychosocial and behavioral determinants that contributes to treatment adherence, virologic suppression, and healthy coping among PLWH in the US; (3) To determine the effectiveness of treatment and prevention guidelines and identify disparities in service delivery for common morbidities with high associated mortality; and (4) To explore HIV, aging, and associated co-morbidities, including the role of microvascular/vascular function, the microbiome, neurocognitive decline in the context of contemporary antiretroviral treatment regimens, and hearing and balance disorders among men and women. Our long-term goal is to improve the health of people living with HIV and to help prevent those without HIV from seroconverting. NARRATIVE HIV is a treatable and preventable disease but there are individuals who have not benefited from therapies to control the virus, improve health, and decrease transmission. We hope to understand why this happens to certain individuals, and develop tools to improve HIV treatment and prevention.",Surviving the HIV Epidemic (S/HE) in metropolitan Washington DC - Advancing knowledge through cohort studies,9954382,U01HL146205,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Capital ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Designing an Intervention to Increase Men's Linkage to Care and Prevention after HIV Self-Testing in Uganda PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The success of HIV treatment and prevention in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is hindered by the gender disparity in access to care. Men in SSA are less likely to undergo HIV testing and more likely to start antiretroviral treatment (ART) at advanced disease stages compared to women, resulting in poorer clinical outcomes. HIV self-testing (HIVST) is shown to be an innovating and empowering method to increase HIV testing coverage in men. In particular, secondary distribution of HIV self-tests to men from their female partners has achieved high uptake in men. However, men’s linkage to care after HIVST is not well evaluated. As clinic linkage is a crucial step to accessing lifesaving ART and prevention including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), the success of HIVST interventions in reducing HIV burden hinges on their ability to link individuals to care. The goal of this K01 Award is to broaden the candidate’s expertise to conduct independent research in global HIV prevention, with a focus on optimizing HIVST and linkage strategies. To complete this research, the candidate will develop new competencies in 1) qualitative research and behavioral science, 2) behavioral economics, and 3) implementation science. These skills build nicely on the candidate’s current proficiencies in epidemiology, mathematical modeling, and cost-effectiveness analyses. This newly developed skillset will enable the candidate to design, evaluate, and adapt locally relevant and scalable HIV interventions to reduce HIV burden in SSA. The candidate has assembled a robust, multidisciplinary mentorship team to guide her research and career development. The research will be conducted in Kampala, Uganda, within a Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) clinic. This is an ideal setting in which to evaluate the effectiveness of secondary distribution of HIV self-tests. Pregnant women commonly report not knowing the HIV-status of their male partner. Furthermore, testing partners of HIV-positive women is a high yield strategy to identify HIV-positive men in need of ART as well as HIV-negative men serodiscordant partnerships who can benefit from PrEP and VMMC. Interviews will be conducted with men regarding their barriers and motivators for linkage and with providers/stakeholders regarding the feasibility of integrating the potential interventions into clinic practice (Aim 1). Using the intervention characteristics identified in Aim 1, the candidate will create and administer a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) to men with HIV-positive female partners (Aim 2). The DCE elicit characteristics of men’s preferred HIVST intervention, which will be used to develop a tailored intervention for optimal uptake. Finally, the candidate will pilot-test the optimal HIV-self testing intervention to 50 pregnant women starting PMTCT and their male partners. She will evaluate the intervention’s acceptability and effectiveness in linking men to confirmatory HIV testing, treatment and prevention (Aim 3). This research is the first to evaluate an intervention to motivate male linkage to care after HIV self-testing. It has the potential to identify strategies to increase HIV testing and linkage to care in SSA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT (PROJECT NARRATIVE) Men in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are less likely than women to test for HIV and link to treatment and prevention, resulting in poorer clinical outcomes. Innovate HIV self-testing strategies demonstrate high male uptake and have the potential to increase HIV testing coverage, but methods to link men to care after HIV self-testing are not well evaluated. This research will study men’s barriers and motivators to clinic linkage after HIV self-testing and pilot-test a feasible and scalable intervention to increase linkage to care; this intervention will be designed and tailored for use in prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) clinics in SSA.",Designing an Intervention to Increase Men's Linkage to Care and Prevention after HIV Self-Testing in Uganda,9768564,K01MH115789,"['Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Circumcision ', ' Male Circumcision ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Couples ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Interview ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Post-partum Women ', ' Postpartum Women ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' expecting mother ', ' expectant mother ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Salaries ', ' Wages ', ' great pox ', ' Syphilis ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Uganda ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Vertical Disease Transmission ', ' mother to child transmission ', ' Vertical Transmission ', ' uptake ', ' Letters ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' preference ', ' empowered ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' advanced disease ', ' advanced illness ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' career development ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' epidemiological model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard of care ', ' successful intervention ', ' treatment adherence ', ' financial incentive ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' screening ', ' behavioral economics ', ' gender disparity ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' antenatal ', ' antepartum ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' recruit ', ' Wait Time ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K01,2019,175389,0.044543699667639367
"Revealing women's hidden role as critical components of HIV transmission networks in Rakai, Uganda: an interdisciplinary approach ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The burden of HIV is ~60% higher in women than men in sub-Saharan Africa, and this gender inequity is a key challenge to HIV control. Identifying women at greatest risk for HIV and their infecting male partners is critical for effective, targeted control of the African HIV epidemic. It is also vital to identify those HIV-infected women most likely to contribute to ongoing viral spread. However, African women vastly underreport sexual contacts and high risk occupations such as sex work in interview-based surveys and clinical settings making their identification challenging. Here, we propose to use phylogenetic, epidemiological, and qualitative methods to study network drivers of female risk of HIV acquisition and onward transmission to men in the rural Rakai District, Uganda. We will use existing data from the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS), a population- based study of HIV incidence and behaviors in 50 communities (n~17,000). In Aim 1 we will identify HIV- infected women who have central roles in transmission networks using viral phylogenetics and then characterize them with RCCS epidemiological data. We will also conduct in-depth interviews with these women to gain deeper insight into their HIV-related risks and to understand the barriers to reporting these risks. In Aim 2 we will use viral phylogenetics in conjunction with probabilistic statistical models to identify the pool of infecting male partners tat sustain the excess HIV burden among Rakai women. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will use microsimulation models to estimate the potential effectiveness of various combination HIV prevention strategies targeted to high risk subgroups to reduce HIV incidence. The proposed research is part of a K01 award and will provide the applicant with the advanced training in HIV modelling, behavioral science, and phylogenetics necessary to transition to an independent investigator with expertise in the application of interdisciplinary methods to HIV epidemiology and prevention. Results will improve female HIV risk assessment and identify candidate targeted strategies to prevent HIV in African women. It also will provide critical formative data fr a future R01 to implement and empirically assess the effectiveness of targeted interventions to high risk women and their partners in Rakai. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The success of interventions to reduce female HIV risk depends upon an understanding of the drivers of excess HIV infection in women. This project studies network drivers of female HIV risk and onward transmission to men in rural Uganda using interdisciplinary methods. We also explore barriers to HIV risk assessment in a setting where women vastly underreport sex work and risky sexual partnerships. This study will inform targeted PEPFAR initiatives to prevent HIV in high risk African women such as DREAMS.","Revealing women's hidden role as critical components of HIV transmission networks in Rakai, Uganda: an interdisciplinary approach",9655283,K01AI125086,"['Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Phylogeny ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Uganda ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Rural ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' Viral ', ' success ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Prevention ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Abate ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Gifts ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Length ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' demographics ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' data format ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Epidemic ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Female ', ' Fishes ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' ']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,127614,0.03370268202158088
"Stress and Mortality Among Black Men PROJECT SUMMARY Black men age-adjusted mortality rate in 2014 was 21.1 percent higher than white men. While several factors have been hypothesized to account for these differences, stress has been noted as a key determinant of Black men's health. Because of its unique position at the nexus of social factors; psychological coping; and the associated physiologic response, stress is an ideal pathway for understanding health disparities. However, stress and its downstream consequences have received relatively little attention as it relates to Black men's mortality. Over the last four years, I having been building a program of research examining social, behavioral and economic determinants of Black men's health which serves as a foundation for this mid-career Independent Scientist (K02) award application. I have two immediate career objectives. First, I want to advance my career by integrating biomarker and genetic data into my existing research portfolio to better understand the basic mechanisms of Black men's stress, and mortality (Aim 1). Second, I want to apply the biopsychosocial model for explaining links between stress and mortality in Black men (Aim 2). My long-term career objective is to establish a national network of scholars who share similar research interest and create a center on men's health and aging (Aim 3). The K02 mechanism would provide me the protected time to achieve my immediate and long-term career goals. To assist in accomplishing my aims, I will be supported by an interdisciplinary group of world renown scholars who work spans a variety of fields including health of Black Americans, biology of stress, inflammation, cognition, biomarker data, longitudinal data, mortality, gerontology and geriatrics. Further I have the support of the Department of Health, Behavior, and Society at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The proposed research and training activities have the potential to propel me from being a mid-career scientist to an independent investigator in the area of Black Men's Health and mortality. Findings from the K02 will be used to inform subsequent research objectives to address unique risks associated with health and functional outcomes to inform policy makers of the evidence for the development of policy relevant solutions for Black men. My ability to conduct high level research and effectively collaborate positions me to take full advantage of what the K02 mechanism offers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Black men have the highest age-adjusted mortality rate of all American subgroups; however, there is a paucity of research that focuses on understanding how stress links to Black men’s mortality. This project seeks to apply a biopsychosocial model for explaining the links between stress and mortality in Black men by integrating biomarker data with social, psychological, and behavioral data. Findings will be to inform subsequent research objectives to address unique risks associated with health and functional outcomes to inform policy makers of the evidence for the development of policy relevant solutions for Black men.

"Recapitulation of sex- disparity in PAH on a microfluidic device and elucidation of  the differences and similarities  in the development, progression and therapy of PAH in male versus female patients Project Summary: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a lethal disease that affects ~4 times as many women as men. Ironically, female patients fare better than male patients; women with PAH live 2 years longer than their male counterparts. Patient responses to existing PAH therapies also vary depending on sex. These gender disparities in PAH may stem, at least in part, from intrinsic differences between the two sexes and from the conflicting roles of sex hormones, especially estrogen. Estrogen increases the pathologic proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells, but it also protects against right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). The role of the male sex hormone testosterone in PAH is poorly defined but it appears to have a part in promoting RVH in men. Progress in understanding the sex- disparity in PAH has been slow, primarily because of the lack of experimental models that can recapitulate human PAH in its sex-specific forms. Existing animal and cellular models, while having aided in addressing many important questions, do not accurately portray the sex-related variability in PAH development and progression, nor are they sufficiently malleable for certain mechanistic studies. A human tissue-chip model of PAH—able to capture its sex- specific disease etiology, reproduce PAH-induced RVH, and simulate sex-specific responses to drug therapy— could provide a much-needed breakthrough in understanding the mechanism of the sex disparity in PAH and lead to improved treatments for PAH patients. Recently, we designed and fabricated such a device, a state-of-the-art microfluidic tissue-chip that mimics the five layers of the pulmonary artery (perivascular, adventitial, medial, intimal and luminal), both normal and diseased. Further, in preliminary studies, we demonstrated that our tissue-chip can recreate PAH-afflicted pulmonary arteries, emulate the severity of the disease, and model the differences in the therapeutic response of male versus female patients. Here, we propose to deploy our new device to study the pathophysiology of different forms of PAH, investigate the influence of sex and sex hormones on development and progression of the disease, and assess the relative efficacies of mono and combination therapies in both sexes. We will also modify the chip to reconstruct PAH-induced RVH to study how intercellular communication between cardiac cells and cells of PAH-afflicted pulmonary arteries contributes to the pathology, and evaluate the effect of drugs on PAH-induced RVH. This is an exceptionally innovative project with far-reaching clinical significance, as it combines the power of microfluidic technology with the flexibility of combinatorial study design to elucidate the pathomechanism of PAH in both women and men. The investigative team, comprising a pharmaceutical scientist with a longstanding interest in PAH, a chemical engineer, an expert in microfluidic technology, two physician scientists, and a PAH biologist, is highly qualified to conduct this study. If successful, this tissue-chip model may revolutionize approaches to studying sex-based pathophysiology and therapy for vascular diseases, and enable clinicians to develop personalized therapies for their PAH patients. Project Narrative: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a little-known disease, causes narrowing and blockage of the blood vessels (pulmonary arteries/arterioles) that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. The disease affects significantly more women than men; up to 10 times, depending on the PAH subtype. Paradoxically, female patients live longer and fare better with the disease than male patients. PAH researchers have been using various animal models to study the gender paradox in PAH. However, none of the existing models can imitate the sex-specific variation in PAH nor have they brought us closer to an effective therapy. In this project, we are proposing to deploy a newly developed, miniaturized device which incorporates patient cells to closely mimic PAH of both male and female patients. We will use this device to model and elucidate the sex-based differences in the development, progression, and therapy of the disease. We believe, if successful, clinicians may one day use the device to prescribe better, personalized treatments for patients.","Recapitulation of sex- disparity in PAH on a microfluidic device and

"Health, Stress, and Tobacco Use Disparities among Sexual Minority Populations PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In response to PA-15-261: The Health of Sexual and Gender Minority Populations, this project “Health, Stress, and Tobacco Use Disparities among Sexual Minority Populations” proposes to use an existing nationally representative dataset to assess the relationships among sexual orientation, discrimination, stress, tobacco/nicotine use behaviors, and DSM-5 tobacco use disorder in the U.S. Tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of death; cigarette smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year in the U.S. Past research has generally found sexual minorities are at heightened risk for cigarette smoking and other tobacco/nicotine use. However, many of these studies are plagued by methodological limitations including small, non-representative samples, lack of heterosexual comparison groups and/or limited sexual orientation measures. To date, no nationally representative studies have examined the DSM-5 tobacco use disorder disparities among sexual minorities and few data exists on severity, comorbidity, disability, help seeking, and recovery associated with DSM-5 tobacco use disorder among sexual minorities. Thus, we propose to build on our prior work and conduct secondary analyses of the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC-III), a nationally representative survey of 36,309 U.S. adults 18 years and older in the U.S. The NESARC-III study represents the only nationally representative study that has sufficient measures and sample size to test for potential age, gender, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic status differences and to meet the objectives of our study, which aims to: (1) examine the prevalence of (a) cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use, and other tobacco/nicotine use, (b) DSM-5 tobacco use disorder severity (includes tobacco and/or nicotine products), and (c) comorbidity of DSM-5 tobacco use disorder and mental health disorders based on major dimensions of sexual orientation (attraction, behavior, and identity); (2) assess the disability (e.g., general health, physical functioning, and social functioning), help seeking (e.g., counseling, nicotine replacement therapy, and medication), and recovery (e.g., early and sustained remission) associated with tobacco/nicotine use and DSM-5 tobacco use disorder based on sexual orientation; and (3) determine the relationships among stressful events, sexual orientation discrimination (individual-level and institutional-level), tobacco/nicotine use and DSM-5 tobacco use disorder based on the Comprehensive Developmental and Minority Stress Model. This project will take advantage of the unique opportunities afforded by the 2012-2013 NESARC-III: the availability of an ethnically / racially diverse sample with large numbers of sexual minorities; the inclusion of multiple measures of sexual orientation based on attraction, behavior and identity; and the wealth of data on cigarette smoking, other tobacco/nicotine use, DSM-5 tobacco use disorder, and DSM-5 mental health disorders. Measures of stressful life events and sexual orientation discrimination will enable assessment of two of the major factors presumed to account for health disparities among sexual minorities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Findings from this project will enhance our understanding of tobacco-related health disparities among sexual minorities in the United States. Understanding prevalence, risk factors, resilience factors, severity, disability, help seeking and recovery associated with DSM-5 tobacco use disorder across sub-groups based on multiple dimensions of sexual orientation is critical for addressing health disparities and designing effective public health prevention and intervention efforts. This project examines new research questions related to tobacco/nicotine use across dimensions of sexual orientation, as well as potential mechanisms underlying tobacco-related health disparities among sexual minorities with a focus on stress, individual-level and institutional-level sexual orientation discrimination.","Health, Stress, and Tobacco Use Disparities among Sexual Minority Populations",9709073,R01CA212517,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Cause of Death ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Counseling ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Health ', ' Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' Nicotine ', ' Peer Review ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Stress ', ' Stressful Event ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Tobacco Use Disorder ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Family member ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' disability ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' cigarette smoking ', ' cigarette use ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Physical Function ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Disease remission ', ' Remission ', ' Manuscripts ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' DSM-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' DSM5 ', ' DSM-5 ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Nicotine Replacement Therapy ', ' nicotine replacement ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' comparison group ', ' Social Functioning ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' sexual minority ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual ', ' LGB ', ' environmental tobacco smoke exposure ', ' secondhand smoke exposure ', ' second hand smoke exposure ', ' exposure to tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ', ' exposure to SHS ', ' exposure to ETS ', ' Passive Smoke Exposure ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' secondary analysis ', ' nicotine use ', ' nicotine consumption ', ' electronic cigarette use ', ' ecigarette use ', ' ecig use ', ' e-cigarette use ', ' e-cig use ', ' sexual identity ', ' tobacco products ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,138757,-0.024117336045751423
"Restore: Improving Sexual Outcomes of Gay and Bisexual Prostate Cancer Survivors Abstract: This application, in response to PA-15-261, “Research leading to interventions to ameliorate health disparities of sexual and gender minorities”, advances research in three areas. First, prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM), with documented disparities, yet it is severely under-researched. Because gay sex differs from vaginal sex, physiologically; the results from 614 studies focused on heterosexual men likely do not generalize to GBM with PCa. There have been no rehabilitation studies specific to GBM survivors of PCa, so clinicians have no relevant studies to inform best practice with their GBM patients. Second, most PCa studies have tested one or rehabilitation components. We will conduct the first treatment study of a state of clinical practice comprehensive rehabilitation program on GBM's quality of life, including on both urinary and sexual function and bother measures. Third, almost all PCa studies have focused on men recently treated for PCa. We will study both GBM recently treated (last 2 years) and GBM post-treatment (2+ years), using a stratified design.  This study builds on our findings in Restore, an R21 which was only the second study of GBM with PCa to be funded by NCI, and the first to reach publication. We conducted N=41 in-depth qualitative interviews with good saturation, and the largest quantitative study of GBM with PCa to date (N=193), the first needs assessment of GBM with PCa, and the first study of same sex partners and care-givers of GBM. Participants described radical prostatectomy as leaving them “humiliated,” “maimed”, “less than other gay men,” and “severely depressed.” Most (88%) reported ongoing sexual challenges contributing to decreased quality of life, poorer mental health, identity challenges and deteriorated primary relationships. Only three of the eight (38%) outcomes commonly experienced by most GBM were discussed as part of treatment. There was no evidence of any standard of professional rehabilitation; indeed, most GBM just treated themselves.  The long-term objective of this research is to improve the health of GBM survivors of PCa and to provide an evidence base for rehabilitation. In Aim I, we will develop an online rehabilitation program tailored for GBM that addresses both the sexual and urinary effects of PCa treatment. In Aim II, we will conduct a comparative recruitment study to identify best methods to recruit 450 GBM with PCa. In Aim III, we will evaluate the effects of the tailored rehabilitation program on sexual and urinary outcomes. We will conduct a 24 month, randomized controlled trial of structured rehabilitation versus routine care. This RCT will identify whether a structured rehabilitation program is effective in addressing the major sexual and urinary problems caused by PCa treatment. As the first treatment study to focus on GBM with PCa (and also on oral and anal sex), it addresses a long-standing health disparity. The study has high potential to transform rehabilitation for GBM with PCa, provide a critical evidence base for clinicians, and inform rehabilitation outcomes for all PCa survivors. PCa is the second most common cancer in GBM, yet it has been severely under-researched. Because there have been no treatment studies of GBM with PCa, we do not know how well treatments work in this population. Because gay sex differs from vaginal sex, physiologically; the results from 614 studies focused on heterosexual men likely do not generalize to GBM with PCa. This study will test the effects of a multi- component online treatment program tailored for GBM survivors on their sexual and urinary outcomes. If successful, the study will demonstrate a new standard of rehabilitation care for this population.",Restore: Improving Sexual Outcomes of Gay and Bisexual Prostate Cancer Survivors,9744633,R01CA218657,"['Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communities ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Exercise ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Interview ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urinary Incontinence ', ' Vacuum Pumps ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' base ', ' Bisexual ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' improved ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Survivors ', ' Pelvic floor structure ', ' Pelvic Floor ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' Anal Sex ', ' Oral Sex ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Bladder Control ', ' urination control ', ' urinary control ', ' urinary continence ', ' micturition control ', ' bladder continence ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Sexual Dysfunction ', ' Sex Disorders ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' Rehabilitation Outcome ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' treatment program ', ' Reporting ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' survive cancer ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' urinary ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' treatment center ', ' Sex Functioning ', ' sexual functioning ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prostate Cancer therapy ', ' prostate cancer treatment ', ' Prostate CA therapy ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' treatment effect ', ' comparative ', ' demographics ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' routine care ', ' clinical practice ', ' arm ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' same-sex couple ', ' same sex relationship ', ' same sex partner ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' community center ', ' rehabilitative care ', ' rehabilitation care ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,594138,-0.022596775816505994
"Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center Project Summary  This application is for the renewal of the Study to Help the AIDS Research Effort (SHARE), which has been the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) since 1984. The MACS was established with sites in Baltimore-Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles, initially to study the natural history of HIV infection in men who have sex with men and later, with the advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the treated history of HIV infection, including the relationship between long-term controlled HIV infection and chronic diseases and co-morbidities associated with aging. To reflect these changing priorities in HIV research, SHARE has had subsequent enrollments to balance proportions of HIV- and HIV+ men and to reflect the HIV epidemic more accurately. Men enrolled have been followed semi annually since 1984 or enrollment and have a) provided questionnaire data, physical exam data, laboratory data (including HIV serostatus, T cell subset measurements, and HIV viral load measurements), and a large repository of plasma, serum, cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other specimens; and these have permitted SHARE and MACS to make major contributions to the understanding of treated and untreated HIV disease, and comorbidities associated with increased survival due to antiretroviral treatment.  The present application, in response to RFA-HL-19-008, aims to extend followup of the SHARE cohort (about 640 men) from 2019 to 2026, to allow merger of SHARE (and the other MACS sites) with the nine sites of the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) into a single cohort, termed the MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS), that will include both men and women. The specific aims of the CCS are outlined in a parallel application from the putative Data and Coordinating Center (DACC) of the CCS, and the 10 Specific Aims of that single cohort are outlined in the DACC application for the CCS; these include Cardiovascular (CV), Pulmonary/Sleep (PS), Neurocognitive NC), Aging (AG), Cancer, HIV Pathogenesis (PA), Psychosocial (PS), Health Disparities, Platform (PL), and Career Development (CD) Aims. The specific aims of the SHARE Clinical Research Site (CRS) are to: 1) play a leading role in the achievement 7 of these Aims by the CCS (i.e., CV, PS, AG, PA, PS, PL, and CD), including serving as a reading center for echocardiography and sleep studies; 2) to contribute to the achievement of the other 3 CCS aims, and 3) to implement all applicable CCS protocols and support the scientific goals of the CCS. Local initiatives on inflammation and physical activity will also support these aims, which take full advantage of the extensive follow-up and repository of biological specimens already available from this cohort and which will be extended under this proposal, enabling further contributions to our understanding and care of comorbidities and other health issues faced by people living with HIV today. Narrative This application is for renewal for 7 years of the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a longstanding study of the natural and treated histories of HIV infection men who have sex with men in four US cites (Baltimore-Washington, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Chicago) which has made many important contributions to the treatment and understanding of HIV infection since 1984. For the next 7 years, we propose to integrate our site with the 9 WIHS sites into a new MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS) which will follow men already enrolled in Baltimore and Washington, DC, and also recruit a few new men replacing those who have been lost to the study, in order to better understand the long-term consequences of living with HIV, including possible effects on chronic diseases and aging, and to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of these consequences.",Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center,9694071,U01HL146201,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Chicago ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' cold storage ', ' cold preservation ', ' Cryofixation ', ' Cryopreservation ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Epidemiology of Obesity, Diabetes, and Hypertension in African Caribbeans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Obesity is a very strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension, which disproportionately affect African ancestry populations. The Caribbean region in particular is experiencing an enormous epidemic of cardio-metabolic disease, with obesity, T2D, and hypertension being considerably higher in African Caribbeans compared to Caribbeans of other race/ethnicities. Despite the current and projected growth in obesity, T2D and hypertension among African Caribbeans, the mechanisms underlying racial/ethnic disparities in these devastating and costly conditions remain largely unknown. T2D and hypertension are driven in part by obesity and body fat distribution, especially fat around and within non-adipose tissue organs (known as ectopic adiposity). Our recent discovery that ectopic skeletal muscle adiposity contributes to incident T2D and hypertension in African Caribbean men supports the hypothesis that ectopic adiposity may be a key risk factor contributing to increased risk of T2D and hypertension in African Caribbean populations. However, in contrast to African Caribbean men, very little is known about the importance of body fat distribution and ectopic adiposity for T2D, hypertension, and resultant cardiovascular disease in African Caribbean women. Our preliminary data underscores the need to extend research to include African Caribbean women to unravel the sex-specific and obesity-related mechanisms for T2D, hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to discover novel factors related to these major conditions in African ancestry populations. Over the past 20 years we have been studying a unique population-based cohort of African Caribbean men from Tobago. We now propose to expand our research on obesity, T2D, hypertension, and CVD among African Caribbean men to include African Caribbean women in Tobago. We will collect data on lifestyle and medical factors, anthropometrics, DXA and CT body composition measures, carotid ultrasound measures of subclinical cardiovascular disease, and create a specimen biobank for future proposals using our existing infrastructure and well-established procedures. In these newly recruited women, we propose to: 1) determine the overall, and age- and BMI- specific prevalence of T2D and hypertension in African Caribbean women in Tobago, and compare the prevalence with our existing data in men; 2) identify traditional and novel lifestyle, cultural, behavioral, reproductive, nutritional, and medical-related risk factors for T2D and hypertension among African Caribbean women, and 3) evaluate the association of body fat distribution and ectopic adiposity in African Caribbean women with prevalent T2D and hypertension, and compare these associations with those previously observed in African Caribbean men. In addition to accomplishing these aims, the collection and archiving of vital specimens and measures (e.g., fecal samples for microbial distribution; DNA and RNA extraction for omics based approaches), and reading of archived vascular images for subclinical CVD will create the foundation for subsequent, focused funding proposals. Finally, combined with our existing data in men, our study will provide a rich resource for the long-term study of cardio-metabolic health among African Caribbeans and enable future comparisons to similarly phenotyped cohorts of African Americans.

In this study, we will expand our research on these cardio-metabolic diseases among African Caribbean men to include African Caribbean women in Tobago, and conduct a comprehensive epidemiological study of these devastating and costly diseases. Our study will have a substantial impact on the field by providing new insight on of cardio-metabolic disease in a high-risk, African Caribbean population, and will enable future comparisons to similar cohorts of African Americans.","Epidemiology of Obesity, Diabetes, and Hypertension in African Caribbeans",9752328,R01HL143793,"['Adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' white adipose

"Does sex matter? Targeting sex differences in age-related lung disease Currently, well-recognized, yet unexplained age and sex related differences in age-associated lung disease may reflect actions of gonadal hormones and/or genes encoded on the sex chromosomes. The gap in knowledge addressed in this proposal centers on whether this sex disparity is due to activational effects of gonadal hormones (differential effects due to estrogen or testosterone) and/or sex chromosome complement. This proposal has high impact since sex chromosome genes and/or sex hormones could potentiate protective factors in females or harmful factors in males. This proposal is high risk as it goes beyond the simple idea that gonadal hormones are the only players that make females different from males. We break down sex-biasing factors into their component parts (e.g., hormones, sex chromosomes, and sex chromosome genes) and manipulate each component while holding others constant to assess their contribution to the sex difference. Preliminary data in this proposal show that in lung tissue obtained from male patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a fatal form of pulmonary fibrosis more common in middle aged and elderly men, there is a 30- fold increase in androgen receptor (AR) mRNA accompanied by an increase in AR receptor protein. This data strongly support the idea that activation by testosterone could promote downstream fibrotic pathways in an age-associated lung disease like IPF. We hypothesize that a) aging male patients with IPF have more severe lung disease due to androgen receptor-activated fibrotic pathways and b) sex differences in lung fibrosis are caused in part by genes encoded by the sex chromosomes. Discovery of new mechanisms to account for the sex disparity in age-associated lung fibrosis will uncover protective and/or harmful factors that may lead to new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. To detect sex-specific differential pathways we will perform the following Aims: Aim 1: Determine the activational effects of gonadal hormones/respective receptors and subsequent downstream signaling that contribute to age-associated lung disease. A.These studies gonadectomize (GDX) aging male and female BLM-treated mice to determine if estrogens are protective and androgens harmful to lung fibrosis. B. Determine the contribution of AR and ER in the development of lung fibrosis using myofibroblasts isolated from lungs of male and female patients with IPF. Aim 2: Determine whether sex chromosomes contribute to sex differences in age-associated lung disease using the four core genotypes (FCG) mouse model. This model separates the effects of gonadal sex (ovaries versus testes) from the sex chromosome complement (XX vs. XY) by producing XX and XY gonadal males and XX and XY gonadal females and will be done in collaboration with Dr. Arthur Arnold. Aging is a complex process that proceeds at a difference pace in men and women in many organs. A number of factors, including gonadal hormones, genes encoded on the sex chromosomes, and gender-related behaviors, could contribute to differences in age-associated lung disease between men and women. It is important that studies regarding the pathogenesis of age-related diseases address the influence of sex.",Does sex matter?

"Center for Point-of-Care Technologies Research for Sexually Transmitted Diseases Project Summary The long-term goals of our center include addressing the epidemics of STDs/HIV in the U.S. and in resource-poor settings by development and better use of Point-of-Care (POC) tests, so as to address health inequity and improve the sexual health of individuals. Our specific aims are: 1. To develop a “Center of Excellence for the Development and Testing of Point of Care Tests (POCT) for Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)” with cores that can: drive the development and application of point-of-care technologies via collaborative efforts that merge scientific and technological capabilities with clinical need and training of developers, as well as end users of POCT. 2. To use clinical drivers of technology progression for developing and expanding existing POC STD technologies, by providing assistance and feed back in an iterative fashion to developers in a “go-no go” manner, such that we insure that deliverables for each project are met. 3. To implement functioning core components that work smoothly together in a collaborative fashion and with other members of the Point-of-Care Technologies Research Network (POCTRN), which can work with our administrative component to implement a smooth transition along a pipeline from developmental prototype assays through early in- house, clinical translation and validation testing, In this coordinated manner, we can assist with the logical development of POC assays, which prove to have qualifications of sufficient scientific merit and can progress towards eventual FDA submission and commercialization.  These goals and aims will be accomplished by an effective administrative component, ascertaining needs of users of POC, training of scientists, funding scientists and engineers for development of prototype and mature POC technologies, and pilot testing and implementation of POC tests in diverse clinical settings, which will lead to the commercialization and use of POC tests for diagnosing STDs in order to improve the sexual health of individuals in the United States and the rest of the world. Narrative Overall Component The relevance of this project to public health is that by use of Point-of Care tests to rapidly and accurately diagnose sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), the sexual health of individuals in both the U.S. and in resource poor settings throughout the world will be improved.

"Surviving the HIV Epidemic (S/HE) in metropolitan Washington DC - Advancing knowledge through cohort studies ABSTRACT About 1.1 million people are living with HIV (PLWH) in the US, with an estimated 39,782 individuals newly diagnosed with HIV in 2016. The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) are two of the longest standing HIV cohort studies in the United States. Established in 1984 and 1993, respectively, these US-based cohorts currently follow 2,235 men and 2,304 women living with HIV, alongside high-risk but uninfected controls. HIV is at epidemic proportions in the nation’s capital, with overall HIV prevalence of 1.9% among the District of Columbia (DC) adult and adolescent residents. Approximately 3.7% of DC residents aged 40 to 49 years and 5.2% of residents aged 50 to 59 years are living with HIV. The highest life time risk of acquiring HIV in the U.S. is highest in DC with an estimated 1 in 17 individuals anticipated to acquire HIV in their lifetime, followed by 1 in 56 risk among the neighboring Maryland residents. Continuing to follow the women we have recruited and expanding our cohort to include a representative group of men and women is imperative in this region with epidemic levels of HIV. Our research will be focused on understanding the behavioral and social determinants that contribute to long term treatment success and failure, with a focus on identifying key resilience factors that may translate into innovative interventions to achieve the global goals of the HIV care continuum, to improve treatment uptake and viral suppression to decrease morbidity and mortality. We have four aims to achieve our goals. (1) To continue our strong collaborative relationship with the national MACS/WIHS CCS in protocol development, implementation, participant enrollment, retention, data acquisition, and sub-study participation; (2) To lead the CCS-wide effort to understand the psychosocial and behavioral determinants that contributes to treatment adherence, virologic suppression, and healthy coping among PLWH in the US; (3) To determine the effectiveness of treatment and prevention guidelines and identify disparities in service delivery for common morbidities with high associated mortality; and (4) To explore HIV, aging, and associated co-morbidities, including the role of microvascular/vascular function, the microbiome, neurocognitive decline in the context of contemporary antiretroviral treatment regimens, and hearing and balance disorders among men and women. Our long-term goal is to improve the health of people living with HIV and to help prevent those without HIV from seroconverting. NARRATIVE HIV is a treatable and preventable disease but there are individuals who have not benefited from therapies to control the virus, improve health, and decrease transmission.

"Sexual Orientation/Gender Identity, Socioeconomic Status, and Health across the Life Course Abstract Socioeconomic status (SES) is a fundamental contributor to health and disease across the life course. Inequalities in health that disfavor sexual and gender minorities have been widely documented in both adolescence and adulthood. Despite the importance of SES to health, knowledge about factors that pattern these resources and strains across sexual and gender minority groups is incomplete, largely because of the absence of appropriate and high quality data, as well as study design limitations for data that do exist. In synchrony with the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) Wave V program project design and activity, this proposed ancillary project will collect, clean, disseminate, and analyze new data from a subset of the Add Health cohort (sexual minorities, transgendered individuals, and a comparison sample of heterosexuals) via a theory-guided ancillary survey that will add information about formative experiences more specific to sexual orientation and gender development, and enhance existing prospective information about SES and determinants of SES. Based on Wave IV data we plan to recruit approximately 2,200 self-identified sexual/gender minorities and a random comparison sample of 1,500 heterosexuals. The unique data collected via this project will provide an unprecedented opportunity for new and current Add Health users to prospectively study the intersections of sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic factors, and health in a population-based sample across the life course at only marginal cost. Positioned within a life course framework and guided by Minority Stress Theory, we will also address three substantive analytical aims using the released ancillary data: 1) to describe the timing and sequence of theoretical milestones in the development of sexual orientation and gender identity; 2) to examine potential mediators (i.e., parent-child relationship quality and subsequent adolescent educational attainment and housing status) of the association between sexual orientation, gender identity, and young adult SES; and 3) to test a hypothesized pathway that economic strain heightens stress, which in turn elevates depressive symptoms. Findings made possible through these new data, in combination with existing longitudinal information about Add Health sample members, have the potential for critical impact on public health policy and intervention strategies to reduce the prevalence of and disparities in disease burden for the sexual and gender minority population. Project Narrative Despite the importance of socioeconomic status to health and documented health inequalities that disfavor sexual and gender minorities, knowledge about factors that pattern these resources and strains across sexual and gender minority groups is incomplete, largely because of the absence of appropriate and high quality data. This cost effective project will build on the population-based National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health by collecting and disseminating data to address these critical knowledge gaps and by testing hypotheses linking economic strain and health across the life course to inform public health policy and interventions.","Sexual Orientation/Gender Identity, Socioeconomic Status, and Health across the Life Course",9701031,R01HD087365,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Family ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Minority Groups ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Data Quality ', ' Inequality ', ' Re 80 ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Collaborations ', ' Respondent ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' health knowledge ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' experience ', ' intergenerational ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Monitor ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' population based ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' health inequalities ', ' sexual minority ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual ', ' LGB ', ' data resource ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,605114,0.02568274188127821
"Young Men of Color Who Have Sex with Men Cohort Study ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  U01 - Cohort Study with Young Men of Color who have Sex with Men In this fourth decade of the HIV epidemic, we continue to see 50,000 new infections annually in the U.S., particularly among Black/African American and Latino young men who have sex with men (YMSM of color), who now account for 60% of new infections among Black/African American MSM and 45% of new infections among Latino MSM. Black/African American YMSM remain five times more likely to be HIV seropositive, seven times more likely to have an undiagnosed HIV infection, and 45% more likely to be diagnosed with an STI than other YMSM. YMSM of color are also the least likely to seek and remain in HIV/AIDS care, and when they do seek care, they typically already have advanced HIV disease. Among youth who initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART), 54% will achieve viral suppression; unfortunately 57% will not be retained in care and less than 6% will remain virally suppressed. Changing the course of this epidemic is going to require a dramatically different approach to prevention. We are therefore proposing to conduct longitudinal research with a large and diverse cohort of 450 YMSM of color in order to prevent new HIV infections, reduce transmission, and reduce HIV/AIDS-related disparities by focusing on successful engagement in care. Building on the HIV Continuum of Care and Prevention paradigm (i.e., seek, test, treat, and retain in care) and the Syndemic Theory of Risk, we will use a mixed-methods study design to collect and analytically triangulate quantitative, qualitative, and biological measures at baseline and every six months. Participants will be recruited from public venues, HIV test sites, and HIV/AIDS clinics using randomized probability and purposeful sampling designs. All participants will be tracked to ensure a retention rate of 90% or better, which is a feasible target given our retention rates of 94% in the Healthy Young Men's (HYM) Study. The specific aims are to 1) better understand and operationally define what linkage, engagement, retention to care (both primary health and HIV/AIDS treatment) and adherence means to HIV- and HIV+ YMSM of color; 2) characterize and monitor over time YMSM of color's use of alcohol and illicit drugs; utilization of HIV testing and prevention services; incidence of HIV and STIs; insurance status and access to health care services, including primary care and HIV/AIDS treatment services; engagement in and utilization of health care and HIV/AIDS treatment services; retention in HIV/AIDS care and adherence to ART; and utilization of biomedical interventions, such as PrEP and PEP; and 3) identify barriers/facilitator of engagement along the HIV Continuum of Care and Prevention. The proposed research builds on close to two decades of NIH-funded research by our team focused on this and other high-risk youth populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is an urgent need to address increasing rates of HIV/AIDS among high-risk Black, Latino and multiracial young men who have sex with men in Los Angeles. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to develop new interventions designed to reduce HIV/STI risk and transmission, reduce HIV/AIDS disease progression, and improve the health and quality of life of HIV+ young men. This research will also inform the development of new HIV service delivery models given that the U.S. is now reevaluating all models of care under the auspices of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy and

"Sexual Orientation, Discrimination, and Health Disparities in DSM-5 Alcohol Use Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In response to PAR-14-338: Secondary Analyses of Existing Alcohol Epidemiology Data, this project Sexual Orientation, Discrimination, and Health Disparities in DSM-5 Alcohol Use Disorders proposes to use existing alcohol epidemiological data to examine relationships among sexual orientation, childhood adversity, sexual orientation discrimination (individual-level and institutional-level), recent stressful events and DSM-5 alcohol use disorders (AUDs). AUDs are among the most prevalent mental health disorders and contribute substantially to morbidity and mortality worldwide. Over 65 million adults in the U.S. will meet criteria for a DSM-5 AUD, with past research finding that sexual minorities are at disproportionately high risk for AUD. To date, no large-scale nationally representative studies have examined sexual-orientation-related health disparities in DSM-5 AUD and there is limited data on DSM-5 AUD severity, comorbidity, and disability among sexual minorities. A significant gap in knowledge remains regarding the underlying reasons why sexual minorities are more likely to meet criteria for DSM-5 AUD. Thus, we propose to build on our prior work by conducting secondary analyses using the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC-III), a nationally representative sample of 36,309 U.S. adults. The NESARC-III is the only nationally representative study that has sufficient measures and sample size to test for potential age, gender, racial/ethnic and sexual orientation differences and to meet the objectives of our study, which aims to: (1) estimate the prevalence of (a) DSM-5 AUD diagnoses including severity (mild, moderate and severe), (b) identify potential differences in AUD diagnoses between DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria, and (c) examine DSM-5 psychiatric comorbidity associated with DSM-5 AUD based on sexual orientation (attraction, behavior, and identity); (2) assess the disability (social functioning), help seeking (e.g., self-help), and recovery (e.g., abstinence) associated with DSM-5 AUD based on sexual orientation; and (3) examine risk factors (e.g., individual- and institutional-level sexual orientation discrimination, and stressful life events). Analyses will focus on multiple developmental domains (i.e., childhood, adolescence, adulthood, past-year) and potential moderators (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, and childhood adversity) associated with DSM-5 AUD severity, psychiatric comorbidity, and disability among sexual minorities. The proposed project will benefit from the unique opportunities afforded by the 2012-2013 NESARC such as: the largest nationally representative sample of sexual minority women and men currently available; the assessment of all three major dimensions of sexual orientation (attraction, behavior and identity); and the wealth of data on DSM-5 AUD and other psychiatric disorders. We will also examine the impact of changes from the DSM-IV to DSM-5 for AUDs among sexual minorities. The project uses a theory-driven approach in assessing how childhood adversity, sexual orientation discrimination, and recent stressors contribute to alcohol-related health disparities based on sexual orientation. PROJECT NARRATIVE To date, there is limited knowledge regarding the epidemiology and etiology of DSM-5 alcohol use disorders among sexual minorities in the United States. The proposed study will help inform prevention and intervention efforts to reduce DSM-5 alcohol use disorders by examining the prevalence, severity, comorbidity, disability, help seeking, recovery, and risk factors associated with DSM-5 alcohol use disorders across sub-groups based on dimensions of sexual orientation in the United States. Findings will help guide future research by providing new information about the underlying mechanisms associated with alcohol use disorders across dimensions of sexual orientation, and about the impact of individual-level sexual orientation discrimination, institutional-level sexual orientation discrimination, and recent stressful life events on DSM-5 alcohol use disorders among sexual minorities.","Sexual Orientation, Discrimination, and Health Disparities in DSM-5 Alcohol Use Disorders",9644975,R01AA025684,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Grant ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Literature ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Peer Review ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Stress ', ' Stressful Event ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' DSM-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition ', ' DSM4 ', ' DSM-4 ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' self help ', ' stressor ', ' Manuscripts ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' DSM-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' DSM5 ', ' DSM-5 ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' comparison group ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' alcohol epidemiology ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' alcohol risk ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' sexual minority ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual ', ' LGB ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' secondary analysis ', ' sexual identity ', ' childhood adversity ', ' pediatric adversity ', ' ']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,283310,0.02807069979902859
"Biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying internalizing psychopathology in a prospective, population-based cohort of sexual minority young adults PROJECT SUMMARY Sexual minority (SM) individuals (e.g., those who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual) are substantially more likely than heterosexuals to experience internalizing psychopathology and associated comorbidity. Young and early adulthood (ages 18 to 34) represents the period during which significant sexual orientation disparities in internalizing psychopathology emerge. Yet, little is known about the biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying the sexual orientation disparity in mental disorders during this critical developmental stage. We have created a rare opportunity, currently unavailable in US-based studies, to address these knowledge gaps by capitalizing on three methodological advancements available in a large prospective, population-based dataset in Sweden: the Swedish National Public Health Survey (SNPHS). These advancements include the opportunity to: (1) follow back SM survey respondents sampled using probability designs; (2) match those SM respondents to a heterosexual comparison using registry data that contains objective records of sociodemographic and mental health characteristics shown to robustly predict internalizing psychopathology; and (3) link longitudinal biomarker data to mental health assessments. Capitalizing on these strengths, our research will address three aims. First, we will evaluate whether psychosocial mechanisms (e.g., negative self-schemas, attentional threat bias, social avoidance) explain the young adult SM disparity in internalizing psychopathology. We address this aim by following a new representative cohort of SM young adults ages 18-34 (N=673) and a matched heterosexual cohort (N=673) drawn from the SNPHS, which we will call the PLUS (Pathways to Longitudinally Understanding Stress) cohort. We will administer to this cohort an online battery of self-report and behavioral measures of internalizing psychopathology and proposed mechanisms for four years annually. Second, we will evaluate whether biological mechanisms explain the young adult SM disparity in internalizing psychopathology. To address this aim, we will collect biomarkers from the PLUS sample, which will be self-collected via the dried blood spot method. These biological measures will capture stress-sensitive inflammatory processes (C- reactive protein, IL-6, TNF) implicated in internalizing psychopathology. Third, we will examine whether stigma-related reactions (e.g., identity concealment) and the biopsychosocial mechanisms identified in Aims 1 and 2 mediate the prospective association between stigma-related stress and internalizing psychopathology among SM young adults in the new PLUS cohort. Secondary analyses for all aims will examine the generalizability of our model to externalizing comorbidities and to intersectional populations of SM. Existing research, and our own pilot data, indicates that the results will generalize to understanding mechanisms underlying internalizing psychopathology among SM in the US and abroad. This theoretically informed, methodologically rigorous investigation permits the most comprehensive test of young adult SM mental health to date, allowing us to identify modifiable treatment targets to advance SM mental health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sexual minority (SM) populations face among the highest odds of depression, anxiety, and suicide of any group; however, little is known about the biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying internalizing psychopathology across SM development, which represents a critical gap in knowledge. This study offers the most comprehensive and methodologically rigorous investigation of internalizing psychopathology among young adult SM populations to date, permitting unprecedented tests of the mechanisms underlying mental disorders among this vulnerable population of young adults. This research promises to uncover new information regarding modifiable treatment targets to advance the health of SM populations both domestically and globally.","Biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying internalizing psychopathology in a prospective, population-based cohort of sexual minority young adults",9639908,R01MH118245,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Data Sources ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Health Surveys ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Probability ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Stress ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Sweden ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Bisexual ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Biological ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Sample Size ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Respondent ', ' Spottings ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Investigation ', ' Reaction ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' cohort ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' TNF gene ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor ', ' TNFα ', ' TNFA ', ' TNF-α ', ' TNF Alpha ', ' TNF A ', ' TNF ', ' Monocyte-Derived TNF ', ' Macrophage-Derived TNF ', ' Cachectin ', ' (TNF)-α ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' comparison group ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' population based ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' data registry ', ' sexual minority ', ' Same-sex ', ' intersectionality ', ' secondary analysis ', ' health assessment ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,811522,-0.0044992287185960005
"Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center Project Summary  This application is for the renewal of the Study to Help the AIDS Research Effort (SHARE), which has been the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) since 1984. The MACS was established with sites in Baltimore-Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles, initially to study the natural history of HIV infection in men who have sex with men and later, with the advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the treated history of HIV infection, including the relationship between long-term controlled HIV infection and chronic diseases and co-morbidities associated with aging. To reflect these changing priorities in HIV research, SHARE has had subsequent enrollments to balance proportions of HIV- and HIV+ men and to reflect the HIV epidemic more accurately. Men enrolled have been followed semi annually since 1984 or enrollment and have a) provided questionnaire data, physical exam data, laboratory data (including HIV serostatus, T cell subset measurements, and HIV viral load measurements), and a large repository of plasma, serum, cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other specimens; and these have permitted SHARE and MACS to make major contributions to the understanding of treated and untreated HIV disease, and comorbidities associated with increased survival due to antiretroviral treatment.  The present application, in response to RFA-HL-19-008, aims to extend followup of the SHARE cohort (about 640 men) from 2019 to 2026, to allow merger of SHARE (and the other MACS sites) with the nine sites of the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) into a single cohort, termed the MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS), that will include both men and women. The specific aims of the CCS are outlined in a parallel application from the putative Data and Coordinating Center (DACC) of the CCS, and the 10 Specific Aims of that single cohort are outlined in the DACC application for the CCS; these include Cardiovascular (CV), Pulmonary/Sleep (PS), Neurocognitive NC), Aging (AG), Cancer, HIV Pathogenesis (PA), Psychosocial (PS), Health Disparities, Platform (PL), and Career Development (CD) Aims. The specific aims of the SHARE Clinical Research Site (CRS) are to: 1) play a leading role in the achievement 7 of these Aims by the CCS (i.e., CV, PS, AG, PA, PS, PL, and CD), including serving as a reading center for echocardiography and sleep studies; 2) to contribute to the achievement of the other 3 CCS aims, and 3) to implement all applicable CCS protocols and support the scientific goals of the CCS. Local initiatives on inflammation and physical activity will also support these aims, which take full advantage of the extensive follow-up and repository of biological specimens already available from this cohort and which will be extended under this proposal, enabling further contributions to our understanding and care of comorbidities and other health issues faced by people living with HIV today. Narrative This application is for renewal for 7 years of the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a longstanding study of the natural and treated histories of HIV infection men who have sex with men in four US cites (Baltimore-Washington, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Chicago) which has made many important contributions to the treatment and understanding of HIV infection since 1984. For the next 7 years, we propose to integrate our site with the 9 WIHS sites into a new MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS) which will follow men already enrolled in Baltimore and Washington, DC, and also recruit a few new men replacing those who have been lost to the study, in order to better understand the long-term consequences of living with HIV, including possible effects on chronic diseases and aging, and to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of these consequences.",Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center,9955905,U01HL146201,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Chicago ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' cold storage ', ' cold preservation ', ' Cryofixation ', ' Cryopreservation ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Surviving the HIV Epidemic (S/HE) in metropolitan Washington DC - Advancing knowledge through cohort studies ABSTRACT About 1.1 million people are living with HIV (PLWH) in the US, with an estimated 39,782 individuals newly diagnosed with HIV in 2016. The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) are two of the longest standing HIV cohort studies in the United States. Established in 1984 and 1993, respectively, these US-based cohorts currently follow 2,235 men and 2,304 women living with HIV, alongside high-risk but uninfected controls. HIV is at epidemic proportions in the nation’s capital, with overall HIV prevalence of 1.9% among the District of Columbia (DC) adult and adolescent residents. Approximately 3.7% of DC residents aged 40 to 49 years and 5.2% of residents aged 50 to 59 years are living with HIV. The highest life time risk of acquiring HIV in the U.S. is highest in DC with an estimated 1 in 17 individuals anticipated to acquire HIV in their lifetime, followed by 1 in 56 risk among the neighboring Maryland residents. Continuing to follow the women we have recruited and expanding our cohort to include a representative group of men and women is imperative in this region with epidemic levels of HIV. Our research will be focused on understanding the behavioral and social determinants that contribute to long term treatment success and failure, with a focus on identifying key resilience factors that may translate into innovative interventions to achieve the global goals of the HIV care continuum, to improve treatment uptake and viral suppression to decrease morbidity and mortality. We have four aims to achieve our goals. (1) To continue our strong collaborative relationship with the national MACS/WIHS CCS in protocol development, implementation, participant enrollment, retention, data acquisition, and sub-study participation; (2) To lead the CCS-wide effort to understand the psychosocial and behavioral determinants that contributes to treatment adherence, virologic suppression, and healthy coping among PLWH in the US; (3) To determine the effectiveness of treatment and prevention guidelines and identify disparities in service delivery for common morbidities with high associated mortality; and (4) To explore HIV, aging, and associated co-morbidities, including the role of microvascular/vascular function, the microbiome, neurocognitive decline in the context of contemporary antiretroviral treatment regimens, and hearing and balance disorders among men and women. Our long-term goal is to improve the health of people living with HIV and to help prevent those without HIV from seroconverting.

"MACS/WIHS -CCS ABSTRACT Nearly half the men and women with HIV infection are racial/ethnic minorities living in the South. HIV infection remains a major public health problem despite the availability of treatments. The purpose of this proposal is to advance the knowledge of the consequences of HIV infection, with a focus on HIV-related comorbidities, by participating as a Clinical Research Sites (CRS) of the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS). To meet this goal, Miami will provide expertise to lead important components of the CCS unified science agenda with protocol development and laboratory support to protocols and sub studies, as well as implementing the full CCS unified science agenda. To accomplish this, we will enroll and follow 500 men and women with HIV infection or at risk for HIV. We will enroll approximately 250 men reflective of the HIV epidemic in Miami, and follow men who have sex with men, bisexual men, and heterosexual men including men who are black or Hispanic representing a large minority proportion. As a current Southern WIHS site we will continue to follow the 149 women enrolled in WIHS who have HIV infection or at risk for HIV and are largely minority reflecting the Miami HIV epidemic. With availability of the CCS protocol, we will enroll additional 100 women from the community to reach a goal of approximately 250 women. The men and women enrolled will be consistent with protocol requirements of the MACS/WIHS consortium for new enrollments. Miami will continue its strong leadership, as we provided for the WIHS. Dr. Fischl as lead PI for this multiple PI proposal is the Vice Chair of the WIHS and has had an active role, along with colleagues, in the development of the unified science agenda, including the specific aims, frequency of core protocol visits, and timing of clinical tests, specimen collections, surveys, assessments and clinical tests. The Miami CRS will focus on protocols and sub studies in several innovative areas.1. Explore cardiovascular outcomes and HIV progression in the syndemic of HIV, tobacco, stimulant use, and depression, and investigate inflammatory biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk and immune activation, including sex differences. 2. Explore the effects of the oral, female genital, and gut microbiome on the HIV reservoir and on exposure to antiretroviral therapy. 3. Evaluate comorbidities and effect of HIV persistence, inflammation and immune markers on comorbidity outcomes and plasma markers of inflammation, amyloid pathology and innate immune cell phenotypes on disease outcomes. 4. Examine the trajectories of vulnerabilities and resiliencies and relationship to HIV outcomes and comorbidities, and mechanisms by which psychosocial and behavioral predictors affect outcomes. 5. Examine the biological pathway whereby psychosocial factors and substance use may increase cardiovascular disease, impair neurocognitive function and contribute to HIV persistence. 5. Utilize developmental funds to support early stage and established investigators to develop innovative pilot studies. These findings will lead to improved understanding of HIV, treatment of HIV and guide future research.

"PRIDEnet for the All of Us Research Program  The All of Us Research Program has an explicit goal to enroll at least 1 million people from all communities to reflect the rich diversity of our nation. To truly engage our broad national diversity, a specific focus on sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals is critical. Engaging SGM people will help ensure equitable representation of the US population in All of Us, biological heterogeneity for high-quality discovery science, and diverse input in All of Us-based research via citizen-scientists and traditional researchers. Our proposal aims to engage SGM people on a national scale to help the All of Us Research Program realize its ambitious goals. SGM people – including members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) communities – are everywhere, demographically diverse, and represent all segments of society. SGM people account for an estimated 4.1% (~13 million people) of the US population. SGM individuals compose an identity-based population that includes sexual minorities (individuals with a sexual orientation that is not heterosexual) and gender minorities (individuals with a gender identity that is not congruent with their sex assigned at birth). SGM communities share a common experience of social marginalization, legal discrimination, political disenfranchisement, and familial rejection. Despite limited data, SGM people are believed to live in nearly all counties in the United States, be a part of other underrepresented minority groups, be in every socioeconomic stratum, and speak the diversity of languages in our nation. To examine this, we recently analyzed all the last three years (2013-2015) of National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data (manuscript under review) and found that self-identified lesbian, gay, and bisexual people were primarily younger (28% were 18-29 years old, 17% were 30-39, 20% were 40-49, 26% were 50-64, and 9% were 65 years or older). Approximately 14% were of Hispanic ethnicity. Regarding race, 80% were Caucasian, 15% were African/African-American, and 5% were another race. Approximately 30% reported an annual earned income of $0 while 11% reported earning more than $75,000. SGM people are largely invisible in federal population-based efforts because they are not counted. Because sexual orientation and gender identity are not collected during the decennial US Census, the precise number of SGM people in the US as well as their age, geographic, linguistic, race, ethnicity, income, and regional distributions are unknown. Without these data, national population-based studies (e.g., National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, NHANES) are unable to generate sampling frames that adequately account for the disproportionate geographic distribution of SGM people (e.g., San Francisco city census reports that ~15% identify as SGM). In 2010, the NIH commissioned the Institute of Medicine (now National Academy of Medicine) to study SGM health to inform the nation’s SGM health research agenda. In addition to recommending research in nearly all aspects of health, the consensus committee poignantly stated, “[t]he relative lack of population-based data presents the greatest challenge to describing the health status and health-related needs of LGBT people” and emphasized the need for national research efforts, such as All of Us, to explicitly include data measures or questions about SGM identity. This report and other research led the National Center for Health Statistics to include sexual orientation in the NHIS and the NIH to designate the SGM population as a “health disparity population for research purposes” in October 2016. SGM people are an underserved and understudied population that is vulnerable to poor health. SGM people experience unique health and healthcare disparities including higher rates of smoking, HIV infection, certain cancers, depression, suicide attempts, and delaying access to health care. Infrequent collection of sexual orientation and gender identity data in clinical settings makes performing SGM-specific studies challenging. Healthcare providers receive inadequate training in caring for SGM patients that often results in mistreatment or discrimination, which deters research participation. While these inequities have been associated with societal stigmatization and minority stress in small studies, difficulties identifying and studying SGM communities severely hinder the identification of health disparity etiologies and the design of appropriate interventions. By meaningfully including and engaging SGM people, the All of Us Research Program has the potential to have a tremendous impact the health and well-being of millions.

"Characteristics of suicide and homicide in a vulnerable population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) adolescents and adults, when compared to similar others, are at increased risk for suicide attempts and exposure to violence victimization. Suicide mortality is also elevated, especially among women, though research studies are sparse. Accordingly, NIH has formally designated sexual/gender minorities a health disparity population. Yet there remain large gaps in the scientific knowledge base that undermine development, dissemination and implementation of effective public health interventions to reduce risk in this vulnerable population. These include whether rates of homicide are similarly elevated among LGBT persons, whether suicide rates are elevated among the transgender population, what role gender and race/ethnicity play in shaping risk, as well as clarification of the contextual factors surrounding these deaths, including missed opportunities for intervention. The primary goal of the project is to identify patterns of risk and to characterize proximal factors associated with violent death due to suicide and homicide among LGBT individuals. Drawing from Minority Stress Theory and, for suicides, the `ideation-to-action' framework, we hypothesize that anti-gay stigma and discrimination creates a vulnerability for violent death among LGBT adolescents and adults. Capitalizing on new information classifying deaths for LGBT status in recent years of the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), we will make novel use of supervised machine learning techniques to recapture LGBT status among deaths in those 12 years and older in the 2003-2015 NVDRS (> 200,000 suicides, homicides, or homicide-suicides). Similar techniques will also be used to code NVDRS death narratives for co-occurring stigma-based contextual factors (e.g., gay disclosure, familial rejection), risk profiles (e.g. mental health, substance use), and recent services use in the immediate circumstances surrounding the death. This will allow us to achieve two study aims. For Aim 1, we will use NVDRS data and exogenous information estimating LGBT population size to generate state-level estimates of suicide and homicide rates, adjusted for population composition, among individuals 12 years and older. We hypothesize that LGBT population risk estimates for suicide and homicide will exceed those of non-LGBT populations. For Aim 2, we will identify sexual orientation and gender minority-linked differences in predisposing and proximal factors associated with suicide and homicide, including indicators of mental health and substance use, patterns of recent health care access, and characteristics of death circumstances, including HIV infection status. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we hypothesize that recent discrimination experiences will be strongly associated with sexual orientation and transgender status, that homicide deaths will more likely show evidence of hate-crime-related contextual factors, and that HIV-related issues will be an important though downward trending precipitant of suicide among sexual minority men. We also anticipate gender and ethnic/racial differences in these effects that will have important implications for future risk reducing interventions. Information obtained will greatly aid achieving the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Project 2025 goal of reducing the suicide rate 20% by 2025 and NIMH's Zero Suicide efforts by providing interventionists with data to design screening and intervention efforts for the LGBT population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project addresses an important public health problem—lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals likely experience higher rates of violent death, including suicide and possibly homicide, than other persons. Why this occurs has yet to be fully determined. This study investigates both predisposing and precipitating factors linked to violent death among LGBT individuals, age 12 years and older. Our goal is to identify modifiable, explanatory factors that can account for mortality disparities between LGBT and non-LGBT individuals.",Characteristics of suicide and homicide in a vulnerable

"Heterosexual couples' attitudes and associated factors of couple's HIV testing and counseling Couples HIV testing and counseling (CHTC, known as Testing Together) entails both partners of the couple receive counseling, test for HIV/STIs, and obtain their test results together. The majority of studies involving heterosexual couple-based HIV risk reduction interventions in the US, including CHTC, have been conducted with specific subgroups (e.g., drug-users) and/or occurred in a specific location (e.g., methadone clinics). Although these projects have demonstrated effectiveness for reducing HIV risk, implementation and uptake of CHTC to capture a wider range of mixed-sex couples is critical as heterosexual sexual transmission accounts for 25% of new HIV infections in the US. As such, additional research is needed to identify barriers and facilitators of CHTC uptake among mixed-sex couples. Offering CHTC to a larger number and wider range of couples would help increase identification of serodiscordant dyads, link newly diagnosed partners to HIV care and treatment, and promote the uptake of other primary prevention strategies (e.g., condoms, PrEP) among those who receive a HIV-negative test result. CHTC also enables couples to create a risk-reduction strategy based on their joint HIV test results, and sexual health and relational preferences. However, implementation and training needs of HIV test counselors must also be considered to increase uptake of CHTC among more mixed-sex couples in the US. Thereby, we propose to conduct a novel, mixed method, two-year project with a nation-wide sample of 300 mixed-sex couples, and 25 HIV test counselors who provide CHTC, as well as 25 HIV test counselors who are CHTC untrained/naïve. All study activities will occur online through established protocols by using HIPAA-compliant web servers, survey software, and video portals. Led by an established PI, expertise of the team includes qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods, dyadic data analysis, online research, CHTC, and HIV risk-related behaviors, complemented with the necessary experience of working with couples and HIV test providers. To begin, we will conduct a nation-wide, cross sectional survey to collect quantitative dyadic data from 300 mixed-sex couples to assess their willingness to use CHTC and associated factors (Aim 1). We hypothesize that couples will fall into 3 groups on whether both, neither, or only one partner (i.e., discrepant) is willing to use CHTC. Among these 300 couples, we will then randomly select 30 couples to conduct qualitative interviews with equal representation from each of these 3 groups to explore and contextualize their perceived barriers and facilitators toward using CHTC; both partners will be interviewed separately and simultaneously (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 50 HIV test counselors (25 provide CHTC, 25 untrained) to examine and identify their implementation and training needs to provide CHTC to more mixed-sex couples (Aim 3). Our findings will help identify what additional implementation and training needs are required for HIV test counselors, as well as the strategies to increase willingness to use CHTC to achieve greater uptake of CHTC among more mixed-sex couples in the US. This high risk, high reward R21 proposal seeks to identify and characterize factors associated with mixed- sex couples' willingness to use couples HIV testing and counseling (CHTC) in the US, as well as the implementation and training needs of HIV test counselors to help increase uptake of CHTC to a larger number and wider range of couples in the US. Presently, heterosexual sexual transmission accounts for 25% of new HIV infections in the US. Proposed findings from this mixed method project will help identify strategies to encourage mixed-sex couples to use CHTC, and note the implementation and training needs of HIV test counselors to provide CHTC to a wider group of couples in the US.",Heterosexual couples' attitudes and associated factors of couple's HIV testing and counseling,9695890,R21MH118966,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Counseling ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Couples ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Goals ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Learning ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Persons ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' uptake ', ' Drug user ', ' persons who use drugs ', ' people who use illicit drugs ', ' people who use drugs ', ' PWUD ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Location ', ' Test Result ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ', ' Public Law 104-191 ', ' PL104-191 ', ' PL 104-191 ', ' Kennedy Kassebaum Act ', ' HIPAA ', ' condoms ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' sexually transmitted ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' sex ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' methadone clinic/center ', ' methadone clinic ', ' methadone center ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' willingness ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' high reward ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' same-sex couple ', ' same sex relationship ', ' same sex partner ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' recruit ', ' web server ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,R21,2019,206283,-0.012768516918449766
"Siempre Seguiré: A Pilot Intervention to Improve Coping with Discrimination and Adherence among HIV-Positive Latino MSM PROJECT SUMMARY HIV-related disparities in diagnosis and disease outcomes persist among Latinos, and Latinos living with HIV show a lower percentage of viral suppression compared to the general HIV-positive population. A growing body of work suggests that stigma and discrimination contribute to health disparities, especially among people living with HIV, who may experience discrimination due to multiple stigmatized identities related to HIV- serostatus, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Internalized stigma and discrimination may lead to health- related disparities by increasing detrimental physiological stress responses, resulting in maladaptive coping and poor health behaviors, including non-adherence to treatment. Moreover, the chronic stress of discrimination may weaken immune function, leading to worse HIV outcomes, including increased HIV viral load. In the proposed research, we will integrate adherence skills-building strategies into a recently developed intervention, Siempre Seguiré, a 7-session group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention for HIV- positive Latino men who have sex with men (LMSM) that aims to improve adaptive coping responses to discrimination. In a small pilot of 30 participants, the intervention was associated with improved coping at follow-up as compared to baseline. However, this pilot did not include a control group, did not address or examine HIV-related behaviors and outcomes such as adherence, retention in care, and viral load suppression, and had a very low sample size. Thus, in the proposed research, we will conduct a larger pilot study in which preliminary effects on HIV outcomes can be assessed. The specific aims are: (1) To modify and refine Siempre Seguiré, a newly developed culturally congruent CBT group intervention for HIV-positive LMSM, to include strategies for antiretroviral treatment adherence and retention in HIV care; and (2) To conduct a small randomized pilot of Siempre Seguiré to examine feasibility and acceptability, as well as to explore preliminary effects on: (a) coping responses to discrimination; and (b) antiretroviral treatment adherence, viral load suppression, and HIV care retention, among LMSM living with HIV. In Phase 1, we will work with HIV treatment adherence intervention experts and key stakeholders, including a community advisory board, to refine our pilot intervention as needed and update our manual to integrate information and skills building regarding HIV treatment adherence and retention in care. In Phase 2, we will conduct a small randomized controlled trial of 80 participants (40 intervention participants divided evenly over 4 intervention groups vs. 40 wait-list control participants). To our knowledge, our study will be the first to test an intervention that addresses coping with discrimination from multiple identities. Our proposed research is consistent with the Institute of Medicine report, The Health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People, which recommends developing interventions to address racial disparities and mental health effects of discrimination among sexual minorities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Latinos in the U.S., especially those who are men who have sex with men, show HIV-related disparities, tending to be diagnosed at a later disease stage, leading to delays in care entry and antiretroviral treatment use, and lower rates of viral suppression. No culturally congruent interventions have been developed to address stress resulting from discrimination, a key contributor to disparities in HIV outcomes among Latino men who have sex with men. We propose to integrate adherence skills-building into a recently developed intervention that addresses coping with discrimination among Latino men who have sex with men.",Siempre Seguiré: A Pilot Intervention to Improve Coping with Discrimination and Adherence among HIV-Positive Latino MSM,9694735,R34MH113413,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Anger ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Control Groups ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Frustration ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Immigration ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Manuals ', ' Medical Records ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Perception ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Prejudice ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Self Concept ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Support Groups ', ' Shame ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' County ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Event ', ' Viral ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' immune function ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' treatment adherence ', ' intervention effect ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' sexual minority ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' intersectionality ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' service organization ', ' intervention participants ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NIMH,RAND CORPORATION,R34,2019,237549,-0.008389289988820155

"Multilevel risk profiles and reproductive health across adolescence and young adulthood. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sexual and reproductive health continues to be a public health concern. In this United States, rates of sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy are highest among adolescents and young adults, making prevention programs to this group to be particularly important. Longitudinal data now exists that can give greater insight into the factors that underlie sexual and reproductive health outcomes develop across adolescence and young adulthood, but new analytic methods are necessary to unlock the full potential of this data. We propose the use and integration of two innovative analytic methods, the time-varying effect modeling (TVEM) and latent class analysis (LCA) to long-term longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). This project has three specific aims. The first aim will elucidate age trends in SRH outcomes (e.g., sexual risk behaviors, STIs, unintended pregnancy) across adolescence through young adulthood at the population level. We will examine how these age-varying trends differ by demographic subgroups (biological sex, race/ethnicity, and sexual minority status). The second aim will examine how profiles of multilevel early risk factors (e.g., parent, peer, neighborhood) predict sexual and reproductive health outcomes across adolescence through young adulthood, and how these age-varying associations differ by demographic subgroup. Finally, the third aim will examine how age-varying individual factors differentially predict SRH outcomes across adolescence and young adulthood, and how these associations differ by demographic subgroups and membership in the early risk profile classes determined in Aim 2. This project will provide population-level knowledge on the developmental course of SRH outcomes, processes which underlie these outcomes, and how they differ by subgroup. Results will allow prevention scientists to design interventions targeting the most relevant risk factors at particular ages for specific subgroups. To maximize the project’s overall impact, published manuscripts will include details of the statistical models and programming syntax so that researchers can use these approaches to answer new questions about age-varying processes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescents and young adults are at risk of negative sexual and reproductive health outcomes; however, new approaches are needed to unlock insights from data collected across development in order for researchers to understand the multilevel predictors and developmental nature of sexual risk. This study will apply novel analytic methods to data from a nationally representative longitudinal study from adolescence through young adulthood to determine how rates of sexual and reproductive health outcomes change across development, how these are predicted by early social-ecological risk factors and individual risk factors at different ages, and how these age-varying effects differ for population subgroups.

"Examining Modifiable Psychosocial Predictors of HIV Seroconversion in a Large Nationwide Cohort of High Risk Men Project Summary Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) remain a population in the U.S. for whom the burden of HIV is high and disproportionate, particularly among younger GBMSM and GBMSM of color, for whom HIV incidence continues to rise despite decades of HIV prevention research to curb the epidemic. However, even among these highest risk groups, risk for infection is not equivalent and the goal of this study is to better understand what factors differentiate levels of risk for HIV infection. Research to date suggests that this disproportionate burden is likely to be exacerbated by psychosocial disparities faced by this population in the form of syndemics and sexual minority stress. However, research on these factors has been limited by a focus on risk for HIV infection operationalized as risk behavior or cross-sectional prevalence of HIV, making actual vulnerability to infection and temporal associations difficult, if not impossible, to determine. We are submitting this application in response to RFA-AI-16-031 Limited Interaction Targeted Epidemiology (LITE) to Advance HIV Prevention (UG3/UH3). We propose to recruit and enroll a large and diverse cohort of approximately 8,000 GBMSM ages 16 and older in the U.S. and Puerto Rico who are at high risk for infection. We will utilize mobile sexual networking applications (“mobile apps”) to identify and enroll these men both to allow for rapid and efficient recruitment and because these apps rapidly increasing in popularity, with research demonstrating that men who use mobile apps are at higher levels of risk for HIV infection than GBMSM recruited through other means. Using this cohort, we will work to achieve three primary aims: (1) we will establish HIV prevalence as well as prevalence of rectal sexually transmitted infections (STIs; gonorrhea and chlamydia) at baseline and subsequently establish rates of HIV and rectal STI incidence among these men 12 months thereafter; (2) we will utilize baseline levels of syndemic, minority stress, and other relevant psychosocial risk factors to develop a model of those modifiable factors that contribute to increased risk for HIV seroconversion (i.e., incidence) as well as rectal STI infection; (3) we will utilize the model to target men in the highest quartile of risk for HIV seroconversion in the cohort and follow them every 6 months thereafter for an additional two years to examine the predictive utility in prospectively predicting HIV seroconversion as well as time to seroconversion. Developing a model of modifiable psychosocial risk factors for actual HIV seroconversion and subsequently testing its reliability and validity in a prospective design has high potential to improve the next generation of HIV prevention interventions aimed at reducing disparities for this population. Project Narrative Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are at disproportionately high risk for HIV infection compared to other groups, but little research has been powered to examine factors associated with their increased susceptibility as measured with biological indicators and prospective HIV serconversion (i.e., incidence). In this study, we will establish a large nationwide cohort of GBMSM at risk for HIV and follow them longitudinally to examine psychosocial predictors of seroconversion. Specifically, we will integrate two prominent psychosocial models of HIV risk for GBMSM—syndemics and minority stress—to identify modifiable targets for future intervention that increase are associated with risk for HIV as measured by rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia infection in addition to actual HIV infection (i.e., seroconversion).",Examining Modifiable Psychosocial Predictors of HIV Seroconversion in a Large Nationwide Cohort of High Risk Men,9955490,UH3AI133674,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' juvenile sex abuse ', ' childhood sexual abuse ', ' Child Sexual Molestation ', ' Child Sexual Abuse ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' chlamydial disease ', ' Chlamydial Infection ', ' Chlamydia Infections ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Color ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Infection ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Bisexual ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' rectal ', ' Distal ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Gays ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Anal Sex ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention program ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' sexual minority ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' seroconversion ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' recruit ', ' infection risk ', ' ']",NIAID,HUNTER COLLEGE,UH3,2019,1552598,0.030931711783501466
"PRIDEnet for the All of Us Research Program  The All of Us Research Program has an explicit goal to enroll at least 1 million people from all communities to reflect the rich diversity of our nation. To truly engage our broad national diversity, a specific focus on sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals is critical. Engaging SGM people will help ensure equitable representation of the US population in All of Us, biological heterogeneity for high-quality discovery science, and diverse input in All of Us-based research via citizen-scientists and traditional researchers. Our proposal aims to engage SGM people on a national scale to help the All of Us Research Program realize its ambitious goals. SGM people – including members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) communities – are everywhere, demographically diverse, and represent all segments of society. SGM people account for an estimated 4.1% (~13 million people) of the US population. SGM individuals compose an identity-based population that includes sexual minorities (individuals with a sexual orientation that is not heterosexual) and gender minorities (individuals with a gender identity that is not congruent with their sex assigned at birth). SGM communities share a common experience of social marginalization, legal discrimination, political disenfranchisement, and familial rejection. Despite limited data, SGM people are believed to live in nearly all counties in the United States, be a part of other underrepresented minority groups, be in every socioeconomic stratum, and speak the diversity of languages in our nation. To examine this, we recently analyzed all the last three years (2013-2015) of National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data (manuscript under review) and found that self-identified lesbian, gay, and bisexual people were primarily younger (28% were 18-29 years old, 17% were 30-39, 20% were 40-49, 26% were 50-64, and 9% were 65 years or older). Approximately 14% were of Hispanic ethnicity. Regarding race, 80% were Caucasian, 15% were African/African-American, and 5% were another race. Approximately 30% reported an annual earned income of $0 while 11% reported earning more than $75,000. SGM people are largely invisible in federal population-based efforts because they are not counted. Because sexual orientation and gender identity are not collected during the decennial US Census, the precise number of SGM people in the US as well as their age, geographic, linguistic, race, ethnicity, income, and regional distributions are unknown. Without these data, national population-based studies (e.g., National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, NHANES) are unable to generate sampling frames that adequately account for the disproportionate geographic distribution of SGM people (e.g., San Francisco city census reports that ~15% identify as SGM). In 2010, the NIH commissioned the Institute of Medicine (now National Academy of Medicine) to study SGM health to inform the nation’s SGM health research agenda. In addition to recommending research in nearly all aspects of health, the consensus committee poignantly stated, “[t]he relative lack of population-based data presents the greatest challenge to describing the health status and health-related needs of LGBT people” and emphasized the need for national research efforts, such as All of Us, to explicitly include data measures or questions about SGM identity. This report and other research led the National Center for Health Statistics to include sexual orientation in the NHIS and the NIH to designate the SGM population as a “health disparity population for research purposes” in October 2016. SGM people are an underserved and understudied population that is vulnerable to poor health. SGM people experience unique health and healthcare disparities including higher rates of smoking, HIV infection, certain cancers, depression, suicide attempts, and delaying access to health care. Infrequent collection of sexual orientation and gender identity data in clinical settings makes performing SGM-specific studies challenging. Healthcare providers receive inadequate training in caring for SGM patients that often results in mistreatment or discrimination, which deters research participation. While these inequities have been associated with societal stigmatization and minority stress in small studies, difficulties identifying and studying SGM communities severely hinder the identification of health disparity etiologies and the design of appropriate interventions. By meaningfully including and engaging SGM people, the All of Us Research Program has the potential to have a tremendous impact the health and well-being of millions.

"Power-Up: An Effectiveness Trial of the Diabetes Prevention Program Tailored for Black and Latino Men Abstract A clinic-based translation of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) tailored to Black and Latino men has the potential to address prior limitations of DPP implementation and reduce diabetes disparities among men. The proposed study is designed to 1) Assess the effect of Power-Up vs. standard care National DPP (NDPP) on percent weight loss among racial/ethnic minority men at risk for diabetes; 2) Compare engagement of racial/ethnic minority men at risk for diabetes in Power-Up vs. standard care NDPP; and 3) Evaluate the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Costs of Power-Up using the RE-AIM framework. We hypothesize that men randomized to Power-Up will achieve significantly greater weight loss (% weight loss from baseline) at 16-weeks and 1-year than men randomized to the standard care, mixed-gender NDPP group. Men randomized to Power-Up will also have significantly greater engagement rates (i.e., attend at least 4 sessions) and retention rates (i.e., attend 9 or more sessions) than men randomized to the standard care NDPP. Using the electronic health record (EHR) systems of a large academic medical center and a network of small to medium independent primary care practices throughout New York City, we will identify Black and Latino men that meet the BMI and A1c eligibility requirements for NDPP. We expect to enroll 450 participants through our health system partners. Men will be randomized 1:1 to either the Power-Up intervention arm or referred to the standard NDPP at their clinic site. Consistent with current CDC standards and current NDPP practices of our health system partners, telephone make-up sessions will be offered by coaches in both conditions to men who miss in-person sessions. The primary outcome will be percent weight loss over 12 months, measured at baseline, approximately 16 weeks (end of core sessions), and 12 months (end of maintenance sessions). Study-collected weight will be the primary outcome measured at the first Power-Up or NDPP session by coaches (or from study staff or clinic sites when sessions are not attended). With a sample size of 450 men, a standard deviation of 4.7 percentage points in percent weight loss, and an intraclass (intra program group) correlation of 0.05 we would have 98.2% power to detect a 2.5 percentage point difference between the intervention arms at the 0.05 significance level. This sample size would also give us 80% power to detect a 13.8 percentage point difference in engagement, and a 16.4 percentage point difference in retention. Tertiary outcomes related to the RE-AIM evaluation include quantitative and qualitative data collected via validated self- report questionnaires administered via telephone survey, EHR-data extraction, and qualitative interviewing of individuals and focus groups. Our evaluation will answer questions most important to healthcare systems and NDPP providers and our partnerships with diverse healthcare systems will allow us to disseminate the intervention broadly, if proven effective. Narrative Men of color are particularly underrepresented in Diabetes Prevention Programs (DPP). The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of an adaptation of the DPP tailored to the needs and preferences of racial and ethnic minority men. The results of this study will help to fill an important gap in health promotion and diabetes prevention for men.",Power-Up: An Effectiveness Trial of the Diabetes Prevention Program Tailored for Black and Latino Men,9801891,R01DK121896,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Epidemic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Interview ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' New York City ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Exposure to ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' prediabetic ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' Prediabetes ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' outreach ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' diabetes risk ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' primary care setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' retention rate ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' personalized approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' racial minority ', ' gender disparity ', ' recruit ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' program costs ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' ']",NIDDK,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,665667,0.05075073455782634
"MOCHA Moving Forward:  a CBPR investigation of chronic disease prevention in older, low-income African-American men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research is designed to use a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach to achieve three research objectives: (1) to identify factors that can be incorporated into expanded Minority Stress Model developed by the PI; (2) to evaluate the effectiveness of the Men of Color Health Awareness (MOCHA) program, and an enhanced MOCHA+ program that uses narrative communication strategies, in lowering stress and risk of chronic diseases in a randomized controlled trial; and (3) to determine those individual, interpersonal and social structural factors that have an impact on stress and the health of low income African- American men. The MOCHA program is the result of a grassroots, community-driven initiative to address the heavy burden of health disparities experienced by low-income African-American men living in Springfield MA. The MOCHA program is sustained by a public - private collaboration between the local chapter of the YMCA and the state Department of Public Health. The MOCHA program is designed to address the physical, mental, social, and spiritual needs of men of color simultaneously in an integrated fashion. It consists of a 12-week program comprised of: (1) 60-minutes of moderately intensive aerobic exercise twice a week; (2) small group discussions of issues facing men of color, in particular, the potentially harmful effects of socially constructed definitions of black masculinity and associated issues of stress, violence, depression and substance abuse; (3) classes on health topics pertinent to chronic disease control, such as nutrition, obesity, high blood pressure, fitness and the social determinants of health. In utilizing a CBPR methodology, university researchers will partner with the MOCHA Steering Committee in all phases of the research, from identifying the main research questions, to identifying mediating factors implicit in the MOCHA model to utilizing appropriate research instruments to answer the primary research question, to data collection and analysis, to disseminating the results of the research, in appropriate fashion, to different audiences. The proposed research methods include: individual interviews of MOCHA participants, ethnographic field observations of digital storytelling (DST) workshops, survey questionnaires and the collection of physiological measures such as cortisol, blood pressure, and BMI. The results of this research will contribute to the identification of effective interventins to address health disparities in low-income African-American men and the dissemination of effective chronic disease prevention programming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African-American men continue to bear a disproportionate share of the burden of health disparities, in general, and chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes, in particular. It is vitally important to identify effective strategies to ameliorate these health inequities. The research plan presented here will identify factors that have the greatest influence on stress and health behaviors in low-income African-American men between the ages 45-65, and determine the effectiveness of an innovative, community-driven program to improve the health and quality of life of these men.","MOCHA Moving Forward:  a CBPR investigation of chronic disease prevention in older, low-income African-American men",9902698,R01MD010618,"['Aerobic Exercise ', ' Aerobic fitness ', ' Aerobic Activity ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Awareness ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' ELISA ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' Exercise ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Gender Role ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Interview ', ' Logic ', ' Massachusetts ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mission ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Influences on risk behaviors among young men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate. I pursue this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) to facilitate my transition towards an independent research career in HIV prevention science. My long-term goal is to become a productive independent HIV prevention behavioral scientist. My goals include the development of HIV prevention interventions - using new and increasingly accessible and influential online media - to address disparities among sexual minority populations across key developmental periods. To date, my training has focused on core strengths and skills in clinical psychology (PhD) and epidemiology (MPH). I have acquired expertise in HIV prevention, behavior change theory, and research methods, with an emphasis on adults. This foundation has prepared me for the proposed next steps of my training, namely, developing expertise in adolescent risk behavior (the time when most risk behavior patterns are established) and the skills necessary for the development, implementation, and evaluation of online prevention interventions and research.  Training plan. The proposed training plan will prepare me to work with adolescent sexual minority populations, a group at significant risk for HIV. Receipt of a K23 award will allow me protected time to acquire the necessary skills. Specifically, with the K23 training I will: (1) acquire the theoretical and methodological skills required for HIV prevention interventions targeting sexual minority populations during adolescence; (2) gain hands-on training in online media-based intervention development, including health communications and media literacy skills; and (3) build the necessary collaboration networks and research infrastructure to enable independence as an NIH-funded investigator. Importantly my training will also increase my sophistication regarding the (4) unique ethical challenges involved in (a) working with a young, often stigmatized population, and (b) delivering online interventions. Both domains are fraught with ethical complexities (e.g., privacy, consent, confidentiality) at a time of rapidly-evolving societal, cultural, health, and technological changes. My training will prepare me to take a leadership role in this emerging and complex research area. Training goals will be achieved through didactic courses, workshops, research experience, and mentoring.  Environment. During the proposed K23, I will be a Research Scientist at The Miriam Hospital and an Assistant Professor at Brown University. At the Miriam, I will have access to the outstanding and highly supportive research environments provided by the Centers for Behavioral and Preventive Medicine and the Centers for AIDS Research. At Brown University, I will have access to the academic resources of the Schools of Medicine and Public Health, including the Alcohol Research Center on HIV. This environment will enhance my training and facilitate my research goals. Through the training, experience, and skills gained as a part of this K23 Award, I will be prepared to pursue funding to conduct a larger randomized controlled trial of an intervention to reduce HIV risk among adolescent sexual minority populations.  Mentors. I will receive mentoring from an outstanding team of internationally recognized and accomplished investigators in HIV prevention and behavioral science, public health, communications, and media literacy.  Proposed research. Young sexual minority males account for a disproportionate number of HIV infections in the United States. Racial and ethnic minority populations are particularly affected. Incidence rates reflect sexual risk behaviors during early sexual experiences. Research suggests that initial sexual risk-taking occurs during adolescence (ages 14-18) among sexual minority males. Therefore, it is important for HIV prevention interventions to target adolescent sexual minority males. Targeting sexual minority males during adolescence will help them learn and establish healthy sexual behaviors early in their psychosexual development, which will have both immediate and long-term health benefits.  Online media use triggers and maintains sexual risk-taking among adolescent sexual minority males. Consequently, it is critical for HIV prevention interventions to address the influence of online media on this population. One way to address this influence is by developing an online sexual health media literacy intervention. To promote adolescent sexual minority males' critical examination of online media and to decrease their sexual risk-taking, I propose a two-stage program of research (i.e., formative research and an exploratory clinical trial) with three aims: (1) develop methods to recruit and retain a racially/ethnically diverse sample of adolescent sexual minority males online using feedback from five focus groups (N ~ 30); (2) develop a brief, online-administered, sexual health media literacy intervention to lower HIV risk behaviors among adolescent sexual minority males using information from a youth advisory board (N ~ 8) and a cross-sectional online survey (N = 200); and (3) conduct an exploratory clinical trial to pilot test the developed online sexual health media literacy intervention for feasibility and acceptability (N = 100). Overall, the proposed research has the potential to reach a wide audience of sexual minority males early in their sexual development, ultimately decreasing their sexual risk-taking and reducing the number of new HIV infections in this population. Further, the proposed research will expand my capacities as an HIV researcher and interventionist and place me at the forefront of online media-based HIV prevention research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescent sexual minority males account for a disproportionate number of new HIV infections in the United States.

"MACS/WIHS -CCS ABSTRACT Nearly half the men and women with HIV infection are racial/ethnic minorities living in the South. HIV infection remains a major public health problem despite the availability of treatments. The purpose of this proposal is to advance the knowledge of the consequences of HIV infection, with a focus on HIV-related comorbidities, by participating as a Clinical Research Sites (CRS) of the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS). To meet this goal, Miami will provide expertise to lead important components of the CCS unified science agenda with protocol development and laboratory support to protocols and sub studies, as well as implementing the full CCS unified science agenda. To accomplish this, we will enroll and follow 500 men and women with HIV infection or at risk for HIV. We will enroll approximately 250 men reflective of the HIV epidemic in Miami, and follow men who have sex with men, bisexual men, and heterosexual men including men who are black or Hispanic representing a large minority proportion. As a current Southern WIHS site we will continue to follow the 149 women enrolled in WIHS who have HIV infection or at risk for HIV and are largely minority reflecting the Miami HIV epidemic. With availability of the CCS protocol, we will enroll additional 100 women from the community to reach a goal of approximately 250 women. The men and women enrolled will be consistent with protocol requirements of the MACS/WIHS consortium for new enrollments. Miami will continue its strong leadership, as we provided for the WIHS. Dr. Fischl as lead PI for this multiple PI proposal is the Vice Chair of the WIHS and has had an active role, along with colleagues, in the development of the unified science agenda, including the specific aims, frequency of core protocol visits, and timing of clinical tests, specimen collections, surveys, assessments and clinical tests. The Miami CRS will focus on protocols and sub studies in several innovative areas.1. Explore cardiovascular outcomes and HIV progression in the syndemic of HIV, tobacco, stimulant use, and depression, and investigate inflammatory biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk and immune activation, including sex differences. 2. Explore the effects of the oral, female genital, and gut microbiome on the HIV reservoir and on exposure to antiretroviral therapy. 3. Evaluate comorbidities and effect of HIV persistence, inflammation and immune markers on comorbidity outcomes and plasma markers of inflammation, amyloid pathology and innate immune cell phenotypes on disease outcomes. 4. Examine the trajectories of vulnerabilities and resiliencies and relationship to HIV outcomes and comorbidities, and mechanisms by which psychosocial and behavioral predictors affect outcomes. 5. Examine the biological pathway whereby psychosocial factors and substance use may increase cardiovascular disease, impair neurocognitive function and contribute to HIV persistence. 5. Utilize developmental funds to support early stage and established investigators to develop innovative pilot studies. These findings will lead to improved understanding of HIV, treatment of HIV and guide future research.

"Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center Project Summary  This application is for the renewal of the Study to Help the AIDS Research Effort (SHARE), which has been the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) since 1984. The MACS was established with sites in Baltimore-Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles, initially to study the natural history of HIV infection in men who have sex with men and later, with the advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the treated history of HIV infection, including the relationship between long-term controlled HIV infection and chronic diseases and co-morbidities associated with aging. To reflect these changing priorities in HIV research, SHARE has had subsequent enrollments to balance proportions of HIV- and HIV+ men and to reflect the HIV epidemic more accurately. Men enrolled have been followed semi annually since 1984 or enrollment and have a) provided questionnaire data, physical exam data, laboratory data (including HIV serostatus, T cell subset measurements, and HIV viral load measurements), and a large repository of plasma, serum, cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other specimens; and these have permitted SHARE and MACS to make major contributions to the understanding of treated and untreated HIV disease, and comorbidities associated with increased survival due to antiretroviral treatment.  The present application, in response to RFA-HL-19-008, aims to extend followup of the SHARE cohort (about 640 men) from 2019 to 2026, to allow merger of SHARE (and the other MACS sites) with the nine sites of the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) into a single cohort, termed the MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS), that will include both men and women. The specific aims of the CCS are outlined in a parallel application from the putative Data and Coordinating Center (DACC) of the CCS, and the 10 Specific Aims of that single cohort are outlined in the DACC application for the CCS; these include Cardiovascular (CV), Pulmonary/Sleep (PS), Neurocognitive NC), Aging (AG), Cancer, HIV Pathogenesis (PA), Psychosocial (PS), Health Disparities, Platform (PL), and Career Development (CD) Aims. The specific aims of the SHARE Clinical Research Site (CRS) are to: 1) play a leading role in the achievement 7 of these Aims by the CCS (i.e., CV, PS, AG, PA, PS, PL, and CD), including serving as a reading center for echocardiography and sleep studies; 2) to contribute to the achievement of the other 3 CCS aims, and 3) to implement all applicable CCS protocols and support the scientific goals of the CCS. Local initiatives on inflammation and physical activity will also support these aims, which take full advantage of the extensive follow-up and repository of biological specimens already available from this cohort and which will be extended under this proposal, enabling further contributions to our understanding and care of comorbidities and other health issues faced by people living with HIV today. Narrative This application is for renewal for 7 years of the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a longstanding study of the natural and treated histories of HIV infection men who have sex with men in four US cites (Baltimore-Washington, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Chicago) which has made many important contributions to the treatment and understanding of HIV infection since 1984. For the next 7 years, we propose to integrate our site with the 9 WIHS sites into a new MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS) which will follow men already enrolled in Baltimore and Washington, DC, and also recruit a few new men replacing those who have been lost to the study, in order to better understand the long-term consequences of living with HIV, including possible effects on chronic diseases and aging, and to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of these consequences.",Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center,9959947,U01HL146201,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Chicago ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' cold storage ', ' cold preservation ', ' Cryofixation ', ' Cryopreservation ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Transwomen, sexual partners and HIV risk Transwomen have an estimated HIV prevalence of 42.4% as of 2013 and there are clear racial/ethnic disparities in HIV risk. HIV prevention among transwomen continues to lag behind research with other key populations. Data on the sexual partners and transmission dynamics in these partnerships may hold the key to effective HIV prevention with transwomen. We propose to conduct a systematic population-based mixed methods study to examine the sexual partnerships of transwomen and identify factors impacting their HIV risk. A barrier to this research is the marginalization of transwomen and their sexual partners creating theoretical and logistical challenges in obtaining inclusive, diverse samples. In this exploratory R21, we propose adaptations of respondent-driven sampling (RDS) to reach 100 transwomen and recruit up to 200 of their sexual partners, capitalizing on RDS' ability to penetrate different, interconnected social groups. We will also conduct a nested qualitative couples study to gather data on ways stigma impacts sexual decision making and risk in partnerships. This proposal offers the field a rare opportunity to determine the partnerships and circumstances defining HIV risk for this key population. The ultimate goal of this research is to determine evidence-based targets for a HIV risk reduction intervention for transwomen and their sexual partners. As such, this study is highly responsive to the National HIV/AIDS strategy need for HIV risk indicators specific to transwomen. This study also falls within the National Institute of Mental Health Division of AIDS Research priorities for advancing the evidence base for interventions beyond the individual level with a focus on high-risk vulnerable populations. This proposal will also maximize the NIH investment in the project by providing data to inform the development of a pilot HIV prevention intervention to reduce HIV risk among transwomen and their sexual partners. Transwomen bear the largest population-specific burden of HIV risk, yet no data have determined precisely why they are at elevated risk. Our study will be the first to engage transwomen’s sexual partners in a population-based systematic study to determine the source and behaviors leading to elevated HIV risk among transwomen. Data gleaned from this study will be used to identify targets for partnership-level interventions and will lead to the submission of a pilot HIV risk reduction intervention focused on transwomen and their sexual partners.","Transwomen, sexual partners and HIV risk",9781493,R21MH118062,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Couples ', ' Decision Making ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Investments ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Precipitating Factors ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Glean ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' insight ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Logistics ', ' Inequality ', ' Respondent ', ' Research Priority ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' unprotected intercourse ', ' condomless sex ', ' condomless intercourse ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' preference ', ' intimate behavior ', ' intimacy ', ' social group ', ' Reporting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Collection ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' sexually transmitted ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' transgender women ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' recruit ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk behavior ', ' ']",NIMH,PUBLIC HEALTH FOUNDATION ENTERPRISES,R21,2019,143324,0.03703800463998182
"Optimizing event-level measures of intersectional stigma for HIV prevention with young sexual minority men Project Summary Gay, bisexual, and other sexual minority men (SMM) are the group most impacted by the domestic HIV epidemic. Critically, these rates are highest among young SMM (YSMM), with Black, Latino, and White YSMM under age 35 being the three groups with the highest rates of new HIV diagnoses in 2016. Although more is known about sexual minority stigma (i.e., internalized homonegativity), little quantitative work has focused on intersectional experiences of stigma for diverse YSMM. Compared to White YSMM, intersectionality theory suggests that increased HIV incidence among Black and Latino YSMM may due in part to the distinct effects of stigma that occurs at the intersection of their multiple stigmatized identities. Researchers have consistently found that exposure to sexual minority stigma at least partially explains the disproportionate experience of adverse mental and physical health outcomes for SMM compared to the general population, though the literature on intersectional stigma and HIV prevention for YSMM is less well developed. Experiences of stigma occur regularly and are shaped by the context in which they occur, and event-level methodologies may be an ideal way to collect such data. Although a few event-level studies of stigma have been published, few if any have used rigorously developed, community-informed, and psychometrically validated items. To address these limitations of the literature to date, the goal of this research is to conduct a three-phase study to generate, refine, and optimize event-level measures of stigma for Black, Latino, and White YSMM aged 16-29 that focus on the intersection of race, ethnicity, sexual minority identity, and gender performance (i.e., masculinity). The first aim of the study is to generate and refine an item pool using the available literature and interviews with expert researchers and community members (Phase 1) followed by an iterative process of cognitive interviewing and pilot testing of the items with YSMM themselves (Phase 2). Having generated an item pool, the second aim of the study is to use the items to conduct a 21-day daily diary study with 150 YSMM (Phase 3) to examine the psychometric properties of the items, reduce the item pool, and test the predictive validity of the items for three HIV prevention outcomes—HIV testing, STI testing, and rectal STI infection. To enroll YSMM for Phases 2 and 3, we will leverage an existing cohort to rapidly recruit participants; in Phase 3, we will also gather data collected during the cohort study both prior to and following the 21-day diary study. The proposed study will address a notable gap in the literature by systematically developing and optimizing items to capture event-level experiences of intersectional stigma for diverse YSMM across the U.S. Overall, the final item pool developed will help to further research on intersectional stigma and health disparities; generating items with greater cultural relevance and lower measurement error will enhance power to detect meaningful intervention effects in future research aiming to reduce intersectional stigma and disparities in HIV incidence for YSMM. Project Narrative Rates of new HIV infections are highest among young sexual minority men (YSMM) who are Black, Latino, or White, and intersectionality theory suggests that these disproportionately high rates of HIV incidence may due in part to the distinct effects of stigma that occurs at the intersection of their multiple stigmatized identities. Experiences of stigma occur regularly and are shaped by the context in which they occur, and event-level methodologies may be an ideal way to collect such data, though there are little to no rigorously developed and validated event-level measures of intersectional stigma for YSMM.

"Examining Modifiable Psychosocial Predictors of HIV Seroconversion in a Large Nationwide Cohort of High Risk Men Project Summary Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) remain a population in the U.S. for whom the burden of HIV is high and disproportionate, particularly among younger GBMSM and GBMSM of color, for whom HIV incidence continues to rise despite decades of HIV prevention research to curb the epidemic. However, even among these highest risk groups, risk for infection is not equivalent and the goal of this study is to better understand what factors differentiate levels of risk for HIV infection. Research to date suggests that this disproportionate burden is likely to be exacerbated by psychosocial disparities faced by this population in the form of syndemics and sexual minority stress. However, research on these factors has been limited by a focus on risk for HIV infection operationalized as risk behavior or cross-sectional prevalence of HIV, making actual vulnerability to infection and temporal associations difficult, if not impossible, to determine. We are submitting this application in response to RFA-AI-16-031 Limited Interaction Targeted Epidemiology (LITE) to Advance HIV Prevention (UG3/UH3). We propose to recruit and enroll a large and diverse cohort of approximately 8,000 GBMSM ages 16 and older in the U.S. and Puerto Rico who are at high risk for infection. We will utilize mobile sexual networking applications (“mobile apps”) to identify and enroll these men both to allow for rapid and efficient recruitment and because these apps rapidly increasing in popularity, with research demonstrating that men who use mobile apps are at higher levels of risk for HIV infection than GBMSM recruited through other means. Using this cohort, we will work to achieve three primary aims: (1) we will establish HIV prevalence as well as prevalence of rectal sexually transmitted infections (STIs; gonorrhea and chlamydia) at baseline and subsequently establish rates of HIV and rectal STI incidence among these men 12 months thereafter; (2) we will utilize baseline levels of syndemic, minority stress, and other relevant psychosocial risk factors to develop a model of those modifiable factors that contribute to increased risk for HIV seroconversion (i.e., incidence) as well as rectal STI infection; (3) we will utilize the model to target men in the highest quartile of risk for HIV seroconversion in the cohort and follow them every 6 months thereafter for an additional two years to examine the predictive utility in prospectively predicting HIV seroconversion as well as time to seroconversion. Developing a model of modifiable psychosocial risk factors for actual HIV seroconversion and subsequently testing its reliability and validity in a prospective design has high potential to improve the next generation of HIV prevention interventions aimed at reducing disparities for this population. Project Narrative Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are at disproportionately high risk for HIV infection compared to other groups, but little research has been powered to examine factors associated with their increased susceptibility as measured with biological indicators and prospective HIV serconversion (i.e., incidence). In this study, we will establish a large nationwide cohort of GBMSM at risk for HIV and follow them longitudinally to examine psychosocial predictors of seroconversion. Specifically, we will integrate two prominent psychosocial models of HIV risk for GBMSM—syndemics and minority stress—to identify modifiable targets for future intervention that increase are associated with risk for HIV as measured by rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia infection in addition to actual HIV infection (i.e., seroconversion).",Examining Modifiable Psychosocial Predictors of HIV Seroconversion in a Large Nationwide Cohort of High Risk Men,9929734,UG3AI133674,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' juvenile sex abuse ', ' childhood sexual abuse ', ' Child Sexual Molestation ', ' Child Sexual Abuse ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' chlamydial disease ', ' Chlamydial Infection ', ' Chlamydia Infections ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Color ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Infection ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Bisexual ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' rectal ', ' Distal ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Gays ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Anal Sex ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention program ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' sexual minority ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' seroconversion ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' recruit ', ' infection risk ', ' ']",NIAID,HUNTER COLLEGE,UG3,2019,265200,0.030931711783501466
"Supplement: Healthy Together: A self-management and support intervention for low-income African-American men with multiple chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Despite much research in chronic disease self-management, significant gaps in knowledge still exist, especially regarding vulnerable and underserved populations. More specifically, low-income African American men are disproportionately affected by chronic conditions, especially coping with multiple morbidities. Low-income African American men also experience additional burdens to health related to cultural beliefs and practices about health, knowledge and perceptions regarding chronic conditions, and lack of support systems, creating even greater health inequalities. The critical intersections of socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, gender, geographic location, and multiple diagnoses strongly influence effective self-management skills and access to support systems. The specific aims for this bioethical issues supplement to Healthy Together: A Self-Management and Support Intervention for Low- Income African American Men with Multiple Chronic Conditions” include: AIM 1: Conduct focus groups with low-income African American men and their health care providers to explore issues and themes related to bioethical issues as lived by the participants; AIM 2: Develop a specific bioethical issues module for low-income African American men with multiple chronic conditions to be added to the NIH funded self-management and support program, Healthy Together, as well as a separate training module for clinical and research staff; and AIM 3: Implement and evaluate a non-experimental pilot study for these bioethical issues modules with at least 50 low- income African American men with multiple chronic conditions and at least 20 clinical and ethics staff, including pre/posttests assessment at baseline, intervention completion, and 3-month follow-up. The purpose of this study is to carefully examine the development and effectiveness of integrating specific bioethical issues into a peer-led self-management and support curricula specifically designed for low-income African American men with multiple morbidities, both chronic physical and mental conditions, as well as those who care for them. This innovative study engages the research participants through community based participatory research to address the complexities of clinical and research-oriented bioethical issues related to effectively managing their chronic diseases. This will advance the science needed to achieve the clinically important outcomes such as minimizing disability, optimizing function, and living well among all patients.

"Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing PROJECT SUMMARY Sexual minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) are at increased risk for numerous adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, suicidality, substance use, HIV/AIDS, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and certain forms of cancer. Despite clear documentation and replication of these health disparities, relatively little is known about their development from adolescence into adulthood. Two theories primarily dominate the literature. Minority stress models describe unique life stressors experienced only by sexual minorities (e.g., victimization and discrimination based on sexual orientation) as primary contributors to health disparities. Other models implicate both minority stress and normative psychosocial processes together as contributors to health disparities. Some such normative processes include (1) psychological adjustment and characteristics (e.g., emotion regulation/dysregulation, substance use expectancies), (2) disrupted social systems (e.g., family, peers, school), and (3) individual differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, temperament). To date, most studies of both minority stress and normative processes are limited by use of cross-sectional samples of primarily Caucasian adults. Although much has been learned from these studies, they do not permit analysis of emerging health disparities across development. Existing research is therefore limited in terms of both generalizability to diverse populations, and validity of directionality inferences between observed ‘predictors’ and ‘outcomes’. My long-term career goals are to identify mechanisms leading to disparities among sexual minorities, with the goal of improving treatments for these disparities, and to develop screening tools to identify high-risk youth who would benefit from prevention programs. To reach this goal, in this project, I address existing limitations to the literature using a prospective sample of individuals who were 14-19 years old at baseline and followed for over 4 years. My goal is to describe developmental trajectories and mechanisms of health disparity development for sexual minority youth compared with heterosexual youth across a 10-year developmental window spanning ages 14- 23 years. Longitudinal outcomes include depression/anxiety, suicidality, delinquency, sleep, general physical health, disordered eating and substance use. Developmental trajectories for these outcomes will be charted by gender and sexual orientation. Confirmatory analyses based on existing literature will be conducted to examine relations between minority stress and adverse outcomes. Then, I will use machine learning to identify as-yet unknown predictors of adverse outcomes and health disparities and characterize any changes in prediction across time. Finally, I will use state-of-the art intervening variable analyses (mediation, moderation) to evaluate longitudinal mechanisms through which health disparities emerge. Findings should provide insight into mechanisms of disparity development and maintenance, informing prevention and intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sexual minority youth (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) experience wide-ranging disparities in mental and physical health that often persist into adulthood, yet little is known about development of these disparities. This research (1) examines developmental trajectories in mental and physical health outcomes from adolescence to young adulthood among sexual minority and matched heterosexual youth, (2) uses advanced statistical methods (e.g., machine learning) to identify hypothesized and currently unknown factors that predict disparities over time, and (3) elucidates pathways to adversity and resilience. Experiences of sexual minority and heterosexual youth and young adults will be compared to uncover possible differences in developmental experiences that lead to health disparities, with possible implications for prevention and intervention among a highly vulnerable population.",Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing,9760277,F31MD014052,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"A pilot Peer Mentor intervention that trains Black MSM to use and promote uptake of HIV/STI self-testing to peers and sex partners. Project Summary Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) experience disparities along the HIV care cascade and there is evidence that sexually transmitted infections (STI) are one of the contributing factors. Self-testing technologies offer convenience and privacy and address barriers to clinic-based testing and has been shown to be well accepted by MSM. Despite these potential benefits and reports of willingness to use free self- testing, uptake has been low due to barriers such as concerns about accuracy of the tests, apprehension to collect specimens, low risk perception and desire for counseling. Studies have also shown that BMSM report willingness to distribute self-testing kits to peers, yet interventions are needed to address barriers which include: fear of peer reactions and anticipated negative effects on relationships. In the proposed study, we will test a 3 session intervention that trains BMSM as Peer Mentors to use HIV and STI (gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis) self-testing and promote uptake to peers and sex partners. Study aims are to examine feasibility, reach and preliminary efficacy of the intervention. We will examine facilitators and barriers to peer outreach, number of peers and sex partners referred to the self-testing website, their testing and risk characteristics and uptake of self-testing among BMSM and their peers/sex partners. We will enroll 140 BMSM who will be randomly assigned to the Peer Mentor intervention or self-testing website only. Inclusion criteria for BMSM are: (a) self-report male sex, (b) condomless anal sex with >1 male in the prior 6 months, (c) Black race, (d) aged 17 or older (based on FDA approved age of HIV oral test kit), (e) internet use at least once a week. BMSM in both conditions will be given coupons with the self-testing website link and unique log-in codes to give to peers/sex partners (aged 17 or older). Peers/sex partners who access the website will provide consent, complete a web-based baseline survey to assess HIV and STI testing history and sexual risk behavior and will be able to request self-test kits to be mailed. BMSM and their peers/sex partners will complete a 3 month follow-up survey to assess HIV and/or STI linkage to care, changes in norms on self-testing, willingness to link to PrEP, and sexual risk. Relevance The proposed study is relevant to the persistent HIV and STI epidemics that disproprotionately impact Black men who have sex with men. This combination biomedical, behavioral and social approach is designed to prevent transmission of HIV and STI infection and improve linkage to care and prevention options (e.g. PrEP) and be cost-effective, sustainable and easily implemented by CBOs and health departments.",A pilot Peer Mentor intervention that trains Black MSM to use and promote uptake of HIV/STI self-testing to peers and sex partners.,9702443,R34MH118178,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Black race ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Counseling ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Epidemic ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' great pox ', ' Syphilis ', ' Latent Syphilis ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' urethral ', ' Urethra ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Trust ', ' uptake ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Baseline Surveys ', ' Anal Sex ', ' tool ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' Reaction ', ' Services ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' prevention service ', ' peer ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' risk perception ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Swab ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Consent ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Communication Tools ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' oral HIV ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' willingness ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' aged ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' high risk ', ' FDA approved ', ' screening ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' co-infection ', ' coinfection ', ' peer coaching ', ' peer teaching ', ' peer mentoring ', ' peer led team learning ', ' peer instruction ', ' peer learning ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk behavior ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R34,2019,327500,-0.009489225068307214
"MOCHA Moving Forward:  a CBPR investigation of chronic disease prevention in older, low-income African-American men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research is designed to use a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach to achieve three research objectives: (1) to identify factors that can be incorporated into expanded Minority Stress Model developed by the PI; (2) to evaluate the effectiveness of the Men of Color Health Awareness (MOCHA) program, and an enhanced MOCHA+ program that uses narrative communication strategies, in lowering stress and risk of chronic diseases in a randomized controlled trial; and (3) to determine those individual, interpersonal and social structural factors that have an impact on stress and the health of low income African- American men. The MOCHA program is the result of a grassroots, community-driven initiative to address the heavy burden of health disparities experienced by low-income African-American men living in Springfield MA. The MOCHA program is sustained by a public - private collaboration between the local chapter of the YMCA and the state Department of Public Health. The MOCHA program is designed to address the physical, mental, social, and spiritual needs of men of color simultaneously in an integrated fashion. It consists of a 12-week program comprised of: (1) 60-minutes of moderately intensive aerobic exercise twice a week; (2) small group discussions of issues facing men of color, in particular, the potentially harmful effects of socially constructed definitions of black masculinity and associated issues of stress, violence, depression and substance abuse; (3) classes on health topics pertinent to chronic disease control, such as nutrition, obesity, high blood pressure, fitness and the social determinants of health. In utilizing a CBPR methodology, university researchers will partner with the MOCHA Steering Committee in all phases of the research, from identifying the main research questions, to identifying mediating factors implicit in the MOCHA model to utilizing appropriate research instruments to answer the primary research question, to data collection and analysis, to disseminating the results of the research, in appropriate fashion, to different audiences. The proposed research methods include: individual interviews of MOCHA participants, ethnographic field observations of digital storytelling (DST) workshops, survey questionnaires and the collection of physiological measures such as cortisol, blood pressure, and BMI. The results of this research will contribute to the identification of effective interventins to address health disparities in low-income African-American men and the dissemination of effective chronic disease prevention programming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African-American men continue to bear a disproportionate share of the burden of health disparities, in general, and chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes, in particular. It is vitally important to identify effective strategies to ameliorate these health inequities. The research plan presented here will identify factors that have the greatest influence on stress and health behaviors in low-income African-American men between the ages 45-65, and determine the effectiveness of an innovative, community-driven program to improve the health and quality of life of these men.","MOCHA Moving Forward:  a CBPR investigation of chronic disease prevention in older, low-income African-American men",9635626,R01MD010618,"['Aerobic Exercise ', ' Aerobic fitness ', ' Aerobic Activity ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Awareness ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' ELISA ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' Exercise ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Gender Role ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Interview ', ' Logic ', ' Massachusetts ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mission ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Parenting and Men's Health: The Utility of the Fathers and Sons Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the public health significance of problems such as substance abuse and depression among African American men, few evidence-based prevention strategies have been developed for these men and even fewer have focused on a strategy that uses their role as a father as a protection against poor health outcomes. This application proposes to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the Fathers and Sons Program for reducing depression and drinking behavior and increasing substance use and mental health service utilization among nonresident African American fathers. It focuses on enhancing fathers' parenting knowledge, attitudes and behaviors, connectedness with their sons, and awareness and use of community resources. This theoretically-based, gender-specific, culturally relevant, family-centered program was originally designed to enhance parenting attitudes and behaviors among nonresident African American fathers and strengthen their relationship with their preadolescent sons as a way to prevent youth risky behaviors. It was developed using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to increase its relevance and appeal to the intended audiences. Preliminary evidence suggests the program is promising for improving health behaviors and well-being among fathers as well. Our goal is to conduct a randomized control trial to evaluate the program for its long-term health benefits for both fathers and sons. The results of the original Fathers and Sons intervention program will be compared to a control group that will receive a family-based program focused on physical activity and nutrition. Because fathers and sons participate in the Fathers and Sons programs together, we will have the added benefit of examining how influencing father's parenting attitudes and behaviors affect their sons' health behaviors, offering intergenerational perspectives on men's health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application proposes to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the Fathers and Sons Program for reducing depression and drinking behavior, and increasing service use among nonresident African American fathers with preadolescent sons. Specifically, it focuses on enhancing fathers' parenting knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, connectedness with their sons, and awareness and use of community resources as strategies for improving their health. Because fathers and sons participate in the program together, we will have the added benefit of examining how influencing fathers' parenting attitudes and behaviors affect their sons' health behaviors, offering intergenerational perspectives on men's health.",Parenting and Men's Health: The Utility of the Fathers and Sons Program,9527163,R01HD084526,"['sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Social Identity ', ' Social Identification ', ' Son ', ' Stress ', ' fabric ', ' Textiles ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Competence ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Health Benefit ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Masculine ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' fatherhood ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' intergenerational ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' father role ', ' paternity ', ' drinking ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' boys ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Behavioral ', ' comparison group ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' drinking behavior ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' male health ', "" men's health "", ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' public health relevance ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' sexual debut ', ' sexual initiation ', ' initiation of sexual activity ', ' attentional control ', ' racial identity ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' Affect ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Attitude to Health ', ' health attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Employment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Fathers ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' nutrition ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,596646,-0.011492230043116895

"Trans Women Connected: a mobile app delivered sexual health promotion program ABSTRACT: , Trans Women Connected: a mobile app delivered sexual health promotion program During the past two decades, the HIV epidemic has severely impacted transgender women in the U.S. According to the CDC persons have the highest HIV incidence of any risk group (56% of Black transgender women are living with HIV), and discrepancies between self-reported prevalence and HIV testing data indicate that many HIV-infected transgender women are not aware of their HIV status. Other public health conditions among transgender women include discrimination-based physical and verbal abuse, poor mental health, alcohol and drug use, and unmet health care needs resulting from limited healthcare access and negative healthcare encounters. These co-occurring problems additively increase sexual risk for transgender women. Despite these health disparities and health-care access barriers, the U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy notes that HIV prevention efforts specifically targeting transgender populations have been minimal, leaving a dearth of evidence-based programs that address the unique needs of transgender women, leaving practitioners to implement programs designed for men who have sex with men (MSM) or cisgender women, even though transgender women's experiences of gender abuse, gender transition, transactional sex and violence distinguish them from most MSM and cisgender women. This project will address these gaps by completing the development of Trans Women Connected: A Sexual Health Promotion Mobile App designed to engage transgender women through a strengths-based approach to HIV/sexual health that uses the power of social networks to identify and encourage protective factors that support the health and well-being of transgender women. Based on the needs of transgender women identified during Phase I research the app will focus heavily on sexual health/harm reduction, identity affirmation, structural issues impacting health, and connectedness. At the end of Phase II the mobile delivered intervention will expand the HIV prevention opportunities for transgender women by (1) providing organizations a cost-effective and easily implementable intervention option that is specifically designed for transgender women; (2) not requiring participants to attend multiple face-to-face sessions in a physical location and instead support iterative intervention implementation at any time or place; (3) permit transgender women to anonymously view the program on their phone in private settings; and (4) offer an effective means for transgender women to connect with each other and providers via mobile technology. The Phase I project demonstrated feasibility in creating an app that changed knowledge and intentions of users with just three activities, while being appealing to the target audience. Phase II will complete the development of the app with 40+ activities, a forum/messaging system for social support/connection, all developed with input from panels of experts and community members. A randomized controlled will assess the effectiveness of the app using a number of measures including STI prevention, improvement in health care seeking, perceived social support. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE During the past two decades, the HIV epidemic has severely impacted transgender women in the United States. Transgender persons have the highest HIV incidence of any risk group, and discrepancies between self-reported prevalence and HIV testing data indicate that many HIV-infected transgender women are not aware of their HIV status. The U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy notes that transgender persons are at high risk for HIV infection and yet efforts specifically targeting transgender populations have been minimal. In addition, transgender women are at increased risks for sexual violence, mental health problems, and they are hindered by a lack of access to trans-friendly competent health care. To date there are limited HIV prevention/sexual health promotion programs that have been developed for and evaluated with this population. To fill this unmet need this project will develop a mobile app delivered multimedia interactive HIV prevention and sexual health promotion program developed for transgender women that delivers the intervention as a series of interactive activities tailored to the user. Activities include those focused on sexual health, health, infrastructure constraints, and connectedness to other transgender women. When complete, the resulting resource will provide a cost effective HIV/STI intervention that can be implemented with transgender women across diverse settings with fidelity, while increasing uptake and effective delivery by appealing to the target audience on their mobile device and ultimately reducing new HIV/STI infections and improving health among transgender women.",Trans Women Connected: a

"Building capacity to develop gender-based violence interventions in peri-urban India Project Summary/Abstract Globally, the highest rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) are reported in Southeast Asia. In India, IPV is intensifying in peri-urban areas where over half of the population lives, exacerbated by growing income inequalities and rapid social change. Given that an average of 35% of ever-married women in India have experienced IPV and its many public health sequelae, it is critical to understand the attitudes held by boys, girls, men, and women that may contribute to IPV. The University of Iowa (Department of Community and Behavioral Health) is collaborating with the Saint John’s Medical College (Department of Community Health) in Bangalore to generate evidence about IPV and develop male-focused strategies to reduce IPV in India’s peri- urban settings. The collaboration is addressing the urgent need to work with early adolescent boys their male role models to reshape ideologies about gender roles and masculinity. Focusing on two peri-urban catchment areas in southeast Bangalore district, the two-year, mixed-method project will 1) assess attitudes and behaviors related to gender roles, masculinity, social capital, and violence against women among couples; 2) explore the attitudes of boys, girls, men, and women related to gender norms; and 3) build the institutional capacity of Saint John's Medical College to address violence against women in their research and medical training. The University of Iowa and St. John’s Medical College will use the findings from the two-year project to develop and test an intervention focused on transforming gender norms and reducing violence against women by working with boys and male role models. For Specific Aim 1, we will use qualitative methods to cognitively validate a survey instrument using existing measures for gender roles, masculinity, social capital, and violence against women, including items from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and the Gender Equitable Men (GEM) scale. We will then randomly sample 528 couples (ages 18-49) and administer the new quantitative survey simultaneously and separately to men and women. For Specific Aim 2, we will use qualitative methods to elucidate our findings from the quantitative survey, with a focus on the relationship between gender norms and IPV. We will focus on men and women (ages 18-49), and boys and girls (ages 10-14), by conducting 60 in-depth interviews and 12 focus group discussions to explore gender norms and identify male role models. Joint implementation by the two institutions—building on the University of Iowa’s key strengths in violence prevention, program design and evaluation, and gender roles related to women’s health—will build research and intervention capacity at St. John’s Medical College, while St. John’s contextual expertise will strengthen the University of Iowa’s cultural competency and understanding of violence-related injury in the peri-urban Indian context. Project Narrative Intimate partner violence (IPV) is the most common form of gender-based violence, with very high rates of IPV in Southeast Asia. In India, where an average of 35% of ever-married women have experienced IPV, the public health burden—which includes injury, depression, psychosocial stress, sexually transmitted diseases, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and death—is particularly heavy in the country’s rapidly growing and socioeconomically divided peri-urban areas. Peri-urban communities in India can benefit from studies that contribute to the development of culturally appropriate, male-focused interventions to transform gender norms and reduce violence against women and girls.",Building capacity to develop gender-based violence interventions in peri-urban India,9613895,R21TW010788,"['Male Adolescents ', ' adolescent boy ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Southeastern Asia ', ' Southeast Asia ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Couples ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Ever Married ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Gender Role ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' India ', ' Interview ', ' Iowa ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' male ', ' role men ', ' male role ', "" Men's Role "", "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Poverty ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' pressure ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Change ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Urban Population ', ' Urbanization ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Woman ', ' working females ', ' Working Women ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' prevent violence ', ' violence prevention ', ' Social Network ', ' Injury ', ' role model ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Demographic and Health Surveys ', ' Inequality ', ' Saints ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention program ', ' cultural competence ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' social capital ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Cognitive ', ' Community Trial ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' violence against women ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' urban Native American ', ' urban Indian ', ' urban American Indian ', ' Population ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' sexual violence ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' institutional capacity ', ' gender-based violence ', ' adverse pregnancy outcome ', ' peri-urban ', ' periurban ', ' urban setting ', ' social expectations ', ' societal expectations ', ' ']",FIC,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2019,147325,0.014766549621637762
"Healthy Together: A self-management and support intervention for low-income African American men with multiple chronic conditions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Despite much research in chronic disease self-management, significant gaps in knowledge still exist, especially regarding vulnerable and underserved populations. More specifically, low-income African American men are disproportionately affected by chronic conditions, especially coping with multiple morbidities. Low-income African American men also experience additional burdens to health related to cultural beliefs and practices about health, knowledge and perceptions regarding chronic conditions, and lack of support systems, creating even greater health inequalities. The critical intersections of socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, gender, geographic location, and multiple diagnoses strongly influence effective self-management skills and access to support systems. The specific aims for this proposed study entitled Healthy Together: A Self-Management and Support Intervention for Low-Income African American Men with Multiple Chronic Conditions” include: AIM 1: Conduct focus groups with low-income African American men, in both urban and rural settings, and health care providers serving low-income African American men to describe lived experiences and identify opportunities and challenges regarding managing health and healthcare as well as key elements influencing participation and engagement. AIM 2: Develop an innovative peer-led chronic disease self-management and support curriculum entitled Healthy Together specifically for low-income African American men living with multiple morbidities. AIM 3: Implement and evaluate a non-experimental pilot study for this self-management and support intervention entitled HT with at least 50 participants (urban=25; rural=25), including pre/post-tests assessment at baseline, intervention completion, and 3 month follow-up. The purpose of this study is to carefully examine the development and effectiveness of a peer-led self-management and support curriculum specifically designed for low-income African American men with multiple morbidities, both chronic physical and mental conditions, living in urban and rural settings. This innovative study engages the research participants through community based participatory research to address the complexities of chronic disease self-management. This will advance the science needed to achieve the clinically important outcomes such as minimizing disability, optimizing function, and living well among all patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Despite much research in chronic disease self-management, significant gaps in knowledge still exist, especially regarding vulnerable and underserved populations. The critical intersections of socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, gender, geographic location, and multiple diagnoses strongly influence effective self-management skills and access to support systems. The purpose of this study is to carefully examine the development and effectiveness of implementing a peer-led self-management and support curriculum specifically designed for low- income African American men with multiple morbidities, both chronic physical and mental conditions, living in urban and rural settings.",Healthy Together: A self-management and support intervention for low-income African American men with multiple chronic conditions,9656284,R15AG059210,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Belief ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hypercholesteremia ', ' hypercholesterolemia ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Predisposing Factor ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family member ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Self Management ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' disability ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' health knowledge ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical study ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical study ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical study ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-center clinical study ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' person centered ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' prototype ', ' health inequalities ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' multimorbidity ', ' undergraduate research ', ' curriculum development ', ' urban setting ', ' rural setting ', ' rural place ', ' rural locality ', ' recruit ', ' health management ', ' healthcare management ', ' health care management ', ' ']",NIA,KENNESAW STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,404363,0.049614046718247685
"HIV Risk Among Young Women Workers in the Industrial Zone in Vietnam Project Abstract Over the last three decades, the industrial zones (IZs) in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) have rapidly expanded as global corporations search for the lowest unit cost in production of garments and other products for high-income country markets. Globally, low skilled rural young women constitute 60-90% of the IZ workforce. For these rural, young women, emerging adulthood takes place in the context of long hours of difficult work, residence in deteriorated and crowded housing and in communities on the periphery of cities, where men represent both a means of temporary or permanent escape from life in the IZ, as well as a source of economic, physical and sexual risk. Among these risks is contracting HIV; studies in South and Southeast Asia, have shown that HIV prevalence is 10-12 times greater among migrants than non-migrants. The study population for this project are young women workers in an IZ in Hanoi, Vietnam with a workforce of 600,000, of which 70% are women. These unmarried women are particularly vulnerable to risk of HIV transmission as they deal with male supervisors and male peers at work, male landlords and shopkeepers and men in the community who seek their disposable income and sexual availability. These risks occur in a context of gender inequality, limited social supports, patriarchal norms, job insecurity and limited knowledge about safe sex. There have been few studies of HIV risk among IZ workers in Vietnam and as a result, they remain an unaddressed risk group. This R21 application seeks to investigate HIV prevalence and risk and generate results that can be the basis for reducing HIV risk among young women workers in the IZ. The specific aims of this proposed exploratory project are to: 1) Conduct qualitative data collection using key informant and in-depth interviews to understand women's adaptations to the IZ and to develop a culturally relevant survey instrument administered to young women working in the IZ; 2) Estimate the prevalence of HIV among young women IZ workers through rapid HIV testing and survey administration to determine knowledge, attitude and behavioral HIV risk factors; 3) Assess the factors associated with serostatus including internal resources, social network composition, risk characteristics, and residential and community sexual violence and stigma. The project will be conducted by an interdisciplinary and international team of experienced Vietnamese and US researchers. Industrial zones have become a part of almost all LMICs and are a major component of production for global corporations and high-income economies. The results of this research can contribute to reducing HIV risk among women workers in Vietnam as well as IZ workers in other countries through empirically-generated results that can form the basis for identifying contributory factors to HIV and HIV risk that can be the targets of effective interventions. Narrative The proposed research focuses HIV prevalence, HIV risk and its contributory factors among young women workers in an industrial zone in Hanoi, Vietnam. HIV risk is a major public health problem for women workers worldwide. This project proposes to the generate results that can contribute to the development of relevant and effective interventions to prevent HIV risk among women workers in Vietnam and globally.",HIV Risk Among Young Women Workers in the Industrial Zone in Vietnam,9780915,R21MH118986,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Asia ', ' Southeastern Asia ', ' Southeast Asia ', ' Attitude ', ' Cities ', ' Coercion ', ' Communities ', ' Connecticut ', ' Critiques ', ' Crowding ', ' Data Collection ', ' Economic Models ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Housing ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Industrialization ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Non-migrant ', ' Nonmigrant ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Unwanted pregnancy ', ' Prevalence Study ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' forced sex ', ' Rape ', ' Forcible intercourse ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Salaries ', ' Wages ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Viet Nam ', ' Vietnam ', ' Woman ', ' working females ', ' Working Women ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Unmarried ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' abortion ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' residence ', ' residential site ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Inequality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Country ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' persons who inject drugs ', ' people who inject illicit drugs ', ' people who inject drugs ', ' PWID ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' unprotected intercourse ', ' condomless sex ', ' condomless intercourse ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' experience ', ' Safe Sex ', ' safer sexual behavior ', ' safer sex ', ' Responsible sexual behavior ', ' Responsible Sex ', ' Protected Sex ', ' Familiarity ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' high risk behavior ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Low income ', ' International ', ' Proliferating ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' vector ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' sexual violence ', ' community setting ', ' effective intervention ', ' emerging adulthood ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' Personal Growth ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' study population ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R21,2019,230333,-0.003416642593132209
"Intimate Partner Violence in Sexual Minority Female Adolescents and Young Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young female sexual minorities (YFSM) are at exceptionally high risk for intimate partner violence (IPV), with over half of YFSM reporting physical or sexual abuse by a dating partner. These young IPV victims may be particularly vulnerable to the negative physical and mental health consequences of IPV, including substance abuse, depression, and suicide, due to minority stress and diminished protective resources (e.g., parent support, community connectedness). In addition, YFSM may be less likely to report and to seek or receive help for IPV because they are not ""out"" about their sexual orientation or they fear stigmatization and discrimination. Women who seek help for same-sex IPV are often denied services (e.g., two-thirds of LGBT IPV survivors were denied access to domestic violence shelters) and feel marginalized and unsupported by domestic violence service systems. Basic research is clearly needed to inform development of culturally sensitive, evidence-based interventions to prevent IPV in YFSM and to support female sexual minority IPV victims. The existing literature, however, has almost exclusively focused on IPV in heterosexuals. Because LGBT teens and young adults face unique issues surrounding their relationships and sexual behaviors (e.g., pressures to deny or conceal sexual identity and activities), the risk and protective factors for IPV, help-seeking behaviors, and consequences of IPV in sexual minority youth are likely quite different from those observed in heterosexual youth. The overarching goal of this project is to begin to address these disparities by conducting an innovative study of IPV in female sexual minority adolescents and young adults (YFSM). We propose a novel, minority stress-informed dynamic developmental systems perspective of IPV in YFSM, which we will test using a mixed-methods, accelerated longitudinal design. Building upon the longest running study of LGBT youth, we will collect quantitative data from two ethnically diverse cohorts of YFSM (N= 530; ages 16-26) every six months for two years, as well as qualitative data from 50 selected participants. We will accomplish the overarching goal with four primary specific aims: (1) Describe the nature and trajectories of IPV in YFSM across adolescence and young adulthood; (2) Identify risk and protective factors for IPV among YFSM, including factors that differentiate violent vs. non-violent/healthy relationships; (3) Examine factors that affect YFSM's reporting of IPV, help-seeking for IPV, and ability to benefit from help provided (e.g., cultural competence of providers); and (4) Evaluate the consequences of IPV in YFSM, identifying factors that raise risk for or protect YFSM victims from revictimization and negative health consequences of IPV. Integration of the resulting quantitative and qualitative data will be used to inform the development of evidence-based interventions to prevent IPV among YFSM and better serve those who experience IPV. 1            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young female sexual minorities experience exceptionally high rates of Intimate partner violence (IPV) and may be particularly vulnerable to subsequent physical and mental health problems. The aims of this study are to describe IPV in female sexual minorities across adolescence and young adulthood, as well as to identify factors that raise risk for or protect against IPV, affect IPV victims' ability to receive appropriate help, and exacerbate or mitigate the negative health consequences of IPV. Data obtained from this project will inform the development of culturally sensitive interventions to reduce the rates of IPV and to better support IPV victims in this vulnerable population.        ",Intimate Partner Violence in Sexual Minority Female Adolescents and Young Adults,9698816,R01HD086170,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Buffers ', ' Communities ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' pressure ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Running ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Woman ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' Shelter facility ', ' Injury ', ' Bisexual ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Domestic Violence ', ' Survivors ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Sexual abuse ', ' sexually abused ', ' sex abuse ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' cultural competence ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' help seeking ', ' Reporting ', ' emotional abuse ', ' mental abuse ', ' Psychological abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' multi-level model ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Teenagers ', ' teenage ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' sex ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' physical abuse ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 21 year old ', ' twenty-one years of age ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' 21 years of age ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' revictimization ', ' longitudinal design ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobia ', ' Homophobic ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' same-sex couple ', ' same sex relationship ', ' same sex partner ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Same-sex ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' violence victimization ', ' violence perpetration ', ' prospective test ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' recruit ', ' service providers ', ' protective factors ', ' sexual identity ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,R01,2019,574904,0.01631227568850796
"MACS/WIHS -CCS ABSTRACT Nearly half the men and women with HIV infection are racial/ethnic minorities living in the South. HIV infection remains a major public health problem despite the availability of treatments. The purpose of this proposal is to advance the knowledge of the consequences of HIV infection, with a focus on HIV-related comorbidities, by participating as a Clinical Research Sites (CRS) of the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS). To meet this goal, Miami will provide expertise to lead important components of the CCS unified science agenda with protocol development and laboratory support to protocols and sub studies, as well as implementing the full CCS unified science agenda. To accomplish this, we will enroll and follow 500 men and women with HIV infection or at risk for HIV. We will enroll approximately 250 men reflective of the HIV epidemic in Miami, and follow men who have sex with men, bisexual men, and heterosexual men including men who are black or Hispanic representing a large minority proportion. As a current Southern WIHS site we will continue to follow the 149 women enrolled in WIHS who have HIV infection or at risk for HIV and are largely minority reflecting the Miami HIV epidemic. With availability of the CCS protocol, we will enroll additional 100 women from the community to reach a goal of approximately 250 women. The men and women enrolled will be consistent with protocol requirements of the MACS/WIHS consortium for new enrollments. Miami will continue its strong leadership, as we provided for the WIHS. Dr. Fischl as lead PI for this multiple PI proposal is the Vice Chair of the WIHS and has had an active role, along with colleagues, in the development of the unified science agenda, including the specific aims, frequency of core protocol visits, and timing of clinical tests, specimen collections, surveys, assessments and clinical tests. The Miami CRS will focus on protocols and sub studies in several innovative areas.1. Explore cardiovascular outcomes and HIV progression in the syndemic of HIV, tobacco, stimulant use, and depression, and investigate inflammatory biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk and immune activation, including sex differences. 2. Explore the effects of the oral, female genital, and gut microbiome on the HIV reservoir and on exposure to antiretroviral therapy. 3. Evaluate comorbidities and effect of HIV persistence, inflammation and immune markers on comorbidity outcomes and plasma markers of inflammation, amyloid pathology and innate immune cell phenotypes on disease outcomes. 4. Examine the trajectories of vulnerabilities and resiliencies and relationship to HIV outcomes and comorbidities, and mechanisms by which psychosocial and behavioral predictors affect outcomes. 5. Examine the biological pathway whereby psychosocial factors and substance use may increase cardiovascular disease, impair neurocognitive function and contribute to HIV persistence. 5. Utilize developmental funds to support early stage and established investigators to develop innovative pilot studies. These findings will lead to improved understanding of HIV, treatment of HIV and guide future research.

"Strong Men, Strong Communities: Cultural Tradition to Improve Native Men's Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indian (AI) males experience profound health disparities compared to their counterparts in all other U.S. racial and ethnic groups. For example, AI men have the highest age-adjusted prevalence of type 2 diabetes (~18 percent) among U.S. men, while non-Hispanic White men have the lowest (~7 percent). In recent decades, AIs have seen a disproportionate increase in diabetes-related complications and mortality compared to all other groups, such that age-adjusted diabetes death rates in AI men are now almost twice those in White men. Several large randomized, controlled trials in non-AIs confirm that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed by interventions that promote healthy lifestyles, but little empirical data exist on interventions to prevent diabetes in AI men. In the clinic-based U.S. Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), only 55 out of 3,234 participants were AI men. Similarly, in the diabetes prevention programs in Native communities, participation by AI males is low, ranging from 33 percent to 74 percent. Many explanations have been posited for the low participation rates among men of all races in lifestyle interventions. Recruiting AI men in clinic-based programs is difficult because they tend to seek clinical care less often than women. AI men's perceptions of normative health behaviors and gender roles may also discourage participation, particularly in mixed-gender groups. Therefore, an urgent need exists for diabetes risk reduction programs tailored to the unique values and habits of AI men, with a particular focus on recruitment and retention.  We are collaborating with the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe (Minnesota), the Indian Health Board of Minneapolis (Minnesota), and Yakama Nation and Heritage University Center for Native American Health and Culture (Washington) to develop the Strong Men, Strong Communities (SMSC) program. This is a culturally appropriate approach for AI men that targets modifiable diabetes risk factors. It uses methods adapted from successful, non-clinic based programs for other high-risk minority populations, and it incorporates elements of DPP and SDPI-DP. Our Specific Aims are to:  1) Refine the SMSC intervention with feedback from focus groups in our 3 partner communities.  2) Compare change in diabetes risk score (primary outcome) and modifiable diabetes risk factors (secondary outcomes) in the SMSC intervention and wait-list control groups.  3) Evaluate the ability of SMSC to retain 80 percent of 240 AI male participants, 21-65 years of age with no previous diagnosis of diabetes. The proposed study fills a striking gap in approaches to increase recruitment and participation in lifestyle programs that reduce diabetes risk in AI men. The proposed study will have broad implications for the ongoing epidemic of AI obesity and diabetes. Given the need to increase AI men's participation in lifestyle interventions, our findings might have substantial public health impact on tribal communities across the U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health disparities experienced by American Indian (AI) men compared to AI women and other racial/ethnic groups are striking and the gap is worsening. AI men have a higher prevalence of obesity, diabetes and a higher diabetes-related mortality rate than White men, yet infrequently participate in lifestyle interventions. Our lifestyle intervention could have broad implications given the epidemic of obesity and diabetes among AI men and help identify strategies to increase AI male participation in interventions to reduce the risk for diabetes.","Strong Men, Strong Communities: Cultural Tradition to Improve Native Men's Health",9782726,R01DK102728,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Animals ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Control Groups ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Feedback ', ' Fishes ', ' Focus Groups ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Fruit ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Gender Role ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Incidence ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Perception ', ' Proteins ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Leanness ', ' Thinness ', ' Universities ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Vegetables ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Washington ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Woman ', ' Bison ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Death Rate ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Native Americans ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' good diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' Healthy diet ', ' waist circumference ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' experience ', ' advanced disease ', ' advanced illness ', ' Participant ', ' Indian reservation ', ' tribal reservation ', ' reservation community ', ' native american reservation ', ' nation reservation ', ' American Indian reservation ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Drops ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' diabetes risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Indigenous ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' cost ', ' community intervention ', ' Mille Lacs Band ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Ojibwe ', ' tribal community ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', "" men's group "", ' male group ', ' male health ', "" men's health "", ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' community setting ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' healthy life-style ', ' retention rate ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' Yakama Indian ', ' Yakama ', ' recruit ', ' Obesity Epidemic ', ' ']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,381219,0.040191217013964414
"A pilot Peer Mentor intervention that trains Black MSM to use and promote uptake of HIV/STI self-testing to peers and sex partners. Project Summary Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) experience disparities along the HIV care cascade and there is evidence that sexually transmitted infections (STI) are one of the contributing factors. Self-testing technologies offer convenience and privacy and address barriers to clinic-based testing and has been shown to be well accepted by MSM. Despite these potential benefits and reports of willingness to use free self- testing, uptake has been low due to barriers such as concerns about accuracy of the tests, apprehension to collect specimens, low risk perception and desire for counseling. Studies have also shown that BMSM report willingness to distribute self-testing kits to peers, yet interventions are needed to address barriers which include: fear of peer reactions and anticipated negative effects on relationships. In the proposed study, we will test a 3 session intervention that trains BMSM as Peer Mentors to use HIV and STI (gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis) self-testing and promote uptake to peers and sex partners. Study aims are to examine feasibility, reach and preliminary efficacy of the intervention. We will examine facilitators and barriers to peer outreach, number of peers and sex partners referred to the self-testing website, their testing and risk characteristics and uptake of self-testing among BMSM and their peers/sex partners. We will enroll 140 BMSM who will be randomly assigned to the Peer Mentor intervention or self-testing website only. Inclusion criteria for BMSM are: (a) self-report male sex, (b) condomless anal sex with >1 male in the prior 6 months, (c) Black race, (d) aged 17 or older (based on FDA approved age of HIV oral test kit), (e) internet use at least once a week. BMSM in both conditions will be given coupons with the self-testing website link and unique log-in codes to give to peers/sex partners (aged 17 or older). Peers/sex partners who access the website will provide consent, complete a web-based baseline survey to assess HIV and STI testing history and sexual risk behavior and will be able to request self-test kits to be mailed. BMSM and their peers/sex partners will complete a 3 month follow-up survey to assess HIV and/or STI linkage to care, changes in norms on self-testing, willingness to link to PrEP, and sexual risk. Relevance The proposed study is relevant to the persistent HIV and STI epidemics that disproprotionately impact Black men who have sex with men. This combination biomedical, behavioral and social approach is designed to prevent transmission of HIV and STI infection and improve linkage to care and prevention options (e.g. PrEP) and be cost-effective, sustainable and easily implemented by CBOs and health departments.",A pilot Peer Mentor intervention that trains Black MSM to use and promote uptake of HIV/STI self-testing to peers and sex partners.,9861270,R34MH118178,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Black race ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' bedsonia ', ' Counseling ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Epidemic ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Syphilis ', ' great pox ', ' Latent Syphilis ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urethra ', ' urethral ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Trust ', ' uptake ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Baseline Surveys ', ' tool ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' Reaction ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' prevention service ', ' peer ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' risk perception ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Swab ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Consent ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Communication Tools ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' oral HIV ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' aged ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' high risk ', ' FDA approved ', ' screening ', ' sexually transmitted HIV ', ' sexual HIV transmission ', ' AAMSM ', ' African American MSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' BMSM ', ' black MSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' coinfection ', ' co-infection ', ' peer instruction ', ' peer led team learning ', ' peer mentoring ', ' peer teaching ', ' peer coaching ', ' peer learning ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' sex risk behavior ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' anal intercourse without condom ', ' anal sex without condom ', ' condomless anal intercourse ', ' unprotected anal intercourse ', ' unprotected anal sex ', ' unsafe anal intercourse ', ' unsafe anal sex ', ' condomless anal sex ', ' compare intervention ', ' comparison intervention ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R34,2020,245625,-0.009489225068307214

"Restore: Improving Sexual Outcomes of Gay and Bisexual Prostate Cancer Survivors Abstract: This application, in response to PA-15-261, “Research leading to interventions to ameliorate health disparities of sexual and gender minorities”, advances research in three areas. First, prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM), with documented disparities, yet it is severely under-researched. Because gay sex differs from vaginal sex, physiologically; the results from 614 studies focused on heterosexual men likely do not generalize to GBM with PCa. There have been no rehabilitation studies specific to GBM survivors of PCa, so clinicians have no relevant studies to inform best practice with their GBM patients. Second, most PCa studies have tested one or rehabilitation components. We will conduct the first treatment study of a state of clinical practice comprehensive rehabilitation program on GBM's quality of life, including on both urinary and sexual function and bother measures. Third, almost all PCa studies have focused on men recently treated for PCa. We will study both GBM recently treated (last 2 years) and GBM post-treatment (2+ years), using a stratified design.  This study builds on our findings in Restore, an R21 which was only the second study of GBM with PCa to be funded by NCI, and the first to reach publication. We conducted N=41 in-depth qualitative interviews with good saturation, and the largest quantitative study of GBM with PCa to date (N=193), the first needs assessment of GBM with PCa, and the first study of same sex partners and care-givers of GBM. Participants described radical prostatectomy as leaving them “humiliated,” “maimed”, “less than other gay men,” and “severely depressed.” Most (88%) reported ongoing sexual challenges contributing to decreased quality of life, poorer mental health, identity challenges and deteriorated primary relationships. Only three of the eight (38%) outcomes commonly experienced by most GBM were discussed as part of treatment. There was no evidence of any standard of professional rehabilitation; indeed, most GBM just treated themselves.  The long-term objective of this research is to improve the health of GBM survivors of PCa and to provide an evidence base for rehabilitation. In Aim I, we will develop an online rehabilitation program tailored for GBM that addresses both the sexual and urinary effects of PCa treatment. In Aim II, we will conduct a comparative recruitment study to identify best methods to recruit 450 GBM with PCa. In Aim III, we will evaluate the effects of the tailored rehabilitation program on sexual and urinary outcomes. We will conduct a 24 month, randomized controlled trial of structured rehabilitation versus routine care. This RCT will identify whether a structured rehabilitation program is effective in addressing the major sexual and urinary problems caused by PCa treatment. As the first treatment study to focus on GBM with PCa (and also on oral and anal sex), it addresses a long-standing health disparity. The study has high potential to transform rehabilitation for GBM with PCa, provide a critical evidence base for clinicians, and inform rehabilitation outcomes for all PCa survivors. PCa is the second most common cancer in GBM, yet it has been severely under-researched. Because there have been no treatment studies of GBM with PCa, we do not know how well treatments work in this population. Because gay sex differs from vaginal sex, physiologically; the results from 614 studies focused on heterosexual men likely do not generalize to GBM with PCa. This study will test the effects of a multi- component online treatment program tailored for GBM survivors on their sexual and urinary outcomes. If successful, the study will demonstrate a new standard of rehabilitation care for this population.",Restore: Improving Sexual Outcomes of Gay and Bisexual Prostate Cancer Survivors,9980806,R01CA218657,"['Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Exercise ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Interview ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research ', ' Science ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urinary Incontinence ', ' Vacuum Pumps ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Prostatovesiculectomy ', ' Radical Prostatectomy ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Survivors ', ' Pelvic Floor ', ' Pelvic floor structure ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' anal intercourse ', ' Anal Sex ', ' Oral Sex ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' depressed ', ' sadness ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' bladder continence ', ' micturition control ', ' urinary continence ', ' urinary control ', ' urination control ', ' Bladder Control ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Surgical ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' surgery ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' interest ', ' Sex Disorders ', ' Sexual Dysfunction ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' Rehabilitation Outcome ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' treatment program ', ' Reporting ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' urinary ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' treatment center ', ' sexual functioning ', ' Sex Functioning ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prostate CA therapy ', ' prostate cancer treatment ', ' Prostate Cancer therapy ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' treatment effect ', ' comparative ', ' demographics ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' routine care ', ' clinical practice ', ' arm ', ' 3-arm study ', ' three-arm study ', ' same sex partner ', ' same sex relationship ', ' same-sex couple ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' community center ', ' rehabilitation care ', ' rehabilitative care ', ' recruit ', ' prostate survivors ', ' prostate cancer survivors ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,606073,-0.022596775816505994
"Trans Women Connected: a mobile app delivered sexual health promotion program ABSTRACT: , Trans Women Connected: a mobile app delivered sexual health promotion program During the past two decades, the HIV epidemic has severely impacted transgender women in the U.S. According to the CDC persons have the highest HIV incidence of any risk group (56% of Black transgender women are living with HIV), and discrepancies between self-reported prevalence and HIV testing data indicate that many HIV-infected transgender women are not aware of their HIV status. Other public health conditions among transgender women include discrimination-based physical and verbal abuse, poor mental health, alcohol and drug use, and unmet health care needs resulting from limited healthcare access and negative healthcare encounters. These co-occurring problems additively increase sexual risk for transgender women. Despite these health disparities and health-care access barriers, the U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy notes that HIV prevention efforts specifically targeting transgender populations have been minimal, leaving a dearth of evidence-based programs that address the unique needs of transgender women, leaving practitioners to implement programs designed for men who have sex with men (MSM) or cisgender women, even though transgender women's experiences of gender abuse, gender transition, transactional sex and violence distinguish them from most MSM and cisgender women. This project will address these gaps by completing the development of Trans Women Connected: A Sexual Health Promotion Mobile App designed to engage transgender women through a strengths-based approach to HIV/sexual health that uses the power of social networks to identify and encourage protective factors that support the health and well-being of transgender women. Based on the needs of transgender women identified during Phase I research the app will focus heavily on sexual health/harm reduction, identity affirmation, structural issues impacting health, and connectedness. At the end of Phase II the mobile delivered intervention will expand the HIV prevention opportunities for transgender women by (1) providing organizations a cost-effective and easily implementable intervention option that is specifically designed for transgender women; (2) not requiring participants to attend multiple face-to-face sessions in a physical location and instead support iterative intervention implementation at any time or place; (3) permit transgender women to anonymously view the program on their phone in private settings; and (4) offer an effective means for transgender women to connect with each other and providers via mobile technology. The Phase I project demonstrated feasibility in creating an app that changed knowledge and intentions of users with just three activities, while being appealing to the target audience. Phase II will complete the development of the app with 40+ activities, a forum/messaging system for social support/connection, all developed with input from panels of experts and community members. A randomized controlled will assess the effectiveness of the app using a number of measures including STI prevention, improvement in health care seeking, perceived social support. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE During the past two decades, the HIV epidemic has severely impacted transgender women in the United States. Transgender persons have the highest HIV incidence of any risk group, and discrepancies between self-reported prevalence and HIV testing data indicate that many HIV-infected transgender women are not aware of their HIV status. The U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy notes that transgender persons are at high risk for HIV infection and yet efforts specifically targeting transgender populations have been minimal. In addition, transgender women are at increased risks for sexual violence, mental health problems, and they are hindered by a lack of access to trans-friendly competent health care. To date there are limited HIV prevention/sexual health promotion programs that have been developed for and evaluated with this population. To fill this unmet need this project will develop a mobile app delivered multimedia interactive HIV prevention and sexual health promotion program developed for transgender women that delivers the intervention as a series of interactive activities tailored to the user. Activities include those focused on sexual health, health, infrastructure constraints, and connectedness to other transgender women. When complete, the resulting resource will provide a cost effective HIV/STI intervention that can be implemented with transgender women across diverse settings with fidelity, while increasing uptake and effective delivery by appealing to the target audience on their mobile device and ultimately reducing new HIV/STI infections and improving health among transgender women.",Trans Women Connected: a

"Stress and Mortality Among Black Men PROJECT SUMMARY Black men age-adjusted mortality rate in 2014 was 21.1 percent higher than white men. While several factors have been hypothesized to account for these differences, stress has been noted as a key determinant of Black men's health. Because of its unique position at the nexus of social factors; psychological coping; and the associated physiologic response, stress is an ideal pathway for understanding health disparities. However, stress and its downstream consequences have received relatively little attention as it relates to Black men's mortality. Over the last four years, I having been building a program of research examining social, behavioral and economic determinants of Black men's health which serves as a foundation for this mid-career Independent Scientist (K02) award application. I have two immediate career objectives. First, I want to advance my career by integrating biomarker and genetic data into my existing research portfolio to better understand the basic mechanisms of Black men's stress, and mortality (Aim 1). Second, I want to apply the biopsychosocial model for explaining links between stress and mortality in Black men (Aim 2). My long-term career objective is to establish a national network of scholars who share similar research interest and create a center on men's health and aging (Aim 3). The K02 mechanism would provide me the protected time to achieve my immediate and long-term career goals. To assist in accomplishing my aims, I will be supported by an interdisciplinary group of world renown scholars who work spans a variety of fields including health of Black Americans, biology of stress, inflammation, cognition, biomarker data, longitudinal data, mortality, gerontology and geriatrics. Further I have the support of the Department of Health, Behavior, and Society at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The proposed research and training activities have the potential to propel me from being a mid-career scientist to an independent investigator in the area of Black Men's Health and mortality. Findings from the K02 will be used to inform subsequent research objectives to address unique risks associated with health and functional outcomes to inform policy makers of the evidence for the development of policy relevant solutions for Black men. My ability to conduct high level research and effectively collaborate positions me to take full advantage of what the K02 mechanism offers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Black men have the highest age-adjusted mortality rate of all American subgroups; however, there is a paucity of research that focuses on understanding how stress links to Black men’s mortality. This project seeks to apply a biopsychosocial model for explaining the links between stress and mortality in Black men by integrating biomarker data with social, psychological, and behavioral data. Findings will be to inform subsequent research objectives to address unique risks associated with health and functional outcomes to inform policy makers of the evidence for the development of policy relevant solutions for Black men.

"COVID-19 and the MWCCS: Pathophysiology, Impact and Outcomes COVID-19 and the MWCCS: Pathophysiology, Impact and Outcomes ABSTRACT COVID-19 cases continue to rise, with over 3,000,000 cases and 130,000 deaths in the US[1] and almost 12 million cases worldwide[2] to date. Manifestations of SARS CoV-2 infection range from asymptomatic to mild, moderate, or severe disease, and primarily affects the lung, but increasing data suggests involvement of other organ and blood systems.[3] Studies document more severe disease and higher mortality among people who are older and/or have co-morbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and chronic lung disease.[4-7] However, there is a paucity of data regarding the acquisition, occurrence and severity of infection among people with HIV (PWH). There is also little data to guide prevention and treatment recommendations for this population, many of whom are older and have comorbidities that may increase not only their risk for acquiring infection, but also the morbidity and mortality among those who acquire infection. Moreover, early reports suggest substantial racial disparities in US COVID-19 rates, with increases in mortality among African Americans.[8] The MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS), the largest and longest-running observational cohort of men and women living with or at risk for HIV in the US provides a unique opportunity to address important knowledge gaps in the acquisition, occurrence, severity and outcomes of COVID-19. The MWCCS is a geographically and racially/ethnically diverse cohort of aging men and women with a high prevalence of risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19 disease including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and smoking. The MWCCS has a rich biorepository of specimens, collects rigorous clinical measures including pulmonary, cardiac, kidney, neurocognitive, and physical function, body composition and has performed cohort-wide genome association studies. The overarching goal of this application is to understand the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic among US men and women with or at risk for HIV infection and to evaluate host factors that contribute to disease acquisition, expression, severity and recovery. The proposed studies will determine COVID incidence, short-term and long-term clinical outcomes, including thrombotic and pulmonary sequelae, and how racial and geographic disparities; immune and genetic risk factors impact these outcomes in the MWCCS.

"MACS/WIHS -CCS ABSTRACT Nearly half the men and women with HIV infection are racial/ethnic minorities living in the South. HIV infection remains a major public health problem despite the availability of treatments. The purpose of this proposal is to advance the knowledge of the consequences of HIV infection, with a focus on HIV-related comorbidities, by participating as a Clinical Research Sites (CRS) of the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS). To meet this goal, Miami will provide expertise to lead important components of the CCS unified science agenda with protocol development and laboratory support to protocols and sub studies, as well as implementing the full CCS unified science agenda. To accomplish this, we will enroll and follow 500 men and women with HIV infection or at risk for HIV. We will enroll approximately 250 men reflective of the HIV epidemic in Miami, and follow men who have sex with men, bisexual men, and heterosexual men including men who are black or Hispanic representing a large minority proportion. As a current Southern WIHS site we will continue to follow the 149 women enrolled in WIHS who have HIV infection or at risk for HIV and are largely minority reflecting the Miami HIV epidemic. With availability of the CCS protocol, we will enroll additional 100 women from the community to reach a goal of approximately 250 women. The men and women enrolled will be consistent with protocol requirements of the MACS/WIHS consortium for new enrollments. Miami will continue its strong leadership, as we provided for the WIHS. Dr. Fischl as lead PI for this multiple PI proposal is the Vice Chair of the WIHS and has had an active role, along with colleagues, in the development of the unified science agenda, including the specific aims, frequency of core protocol visits, and timing of clinical tests, specimen collections, surveys, assessments and clinical tests. The Miami CRS will focus on protocols and sub studies in several innovative areas.1. Explore cardiovascular outcomes and HIV progression in the syndemic of HIV, tobacco, stimulant use, and depression, and investigate inflammatory biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk and immune activation, including sex differences. 2. Explore the effects of the oral, female genital, and gut microbiome on the HIV reservoir and on exposure to antiretroviral therapy. 3. Evaluate comorbidities and effect of HIV persistence, inflammation and immune markers on comorbidity outcomes and plasma markers of inflammation, amyloid pathology and innate immune cell phenotypes on disease outcomes. 4. Examine the trajectories of vulnerabilities and resiliencies and relationship to HIV outcomes and comorbidities, and mechanisms by which psychosocial and behavioral predictors affect outcomes. 5. Examine the biological pathway whereby psychosocial factors and substance use may increase cardiovascular disease, impair neurocognitive function and contribute to HIV persistence. 5. Utilize developmental funds to support early stage and established investigators to develop innovative pilot studies. These findings will lead to improved understanding of HIV, treatment of HIV and guide future research.

"Center for Point-of-Care Technologies Research for Sexually Transmitted Diseases Project Summary The long-term goals of our center include addressing the epidemics of STDs/HIV in the U.S. and in resource-poor settings by development and better use of Point-of-Care (POC) tests, so as to address health inequity and improve the sexual health of individuals. Our specific aims are: 1. To develop a “Center of Excellence for the Development and Testing of Point of Care Tests (POCT) for Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)” with cores that can: drive the development and application of point-of-care technologies via collaborative efforts that merge scientific and technological capabilities with clinical need and training of developers, as well as end users of POCT. 2. To use clinical drivers of technology progression for developing and expanding existing POC STD technologies, by providing assistance and feed back in an iterative fashion to developers in a “go-no go” manner, such that we insure that deliverables for each project are met. 3. To implement functioning core components that work smoothly together in a collaborative fashion and with other members of the Point-of-Care Technologies Research Network (POCTRN), which can work with our administrative component to implement a smooth transition along a pipeline from developmental prototype assays through early in- house, clinical translation and validation testing, In this coordinated manner, we can assist with the logical development of POC assays, which prove to have qualifications of sufficient scientific merit and can progress towards eventual FDA submission and commercialization.  These goals and aims will be accomplished by an effective administrative component, ascertaining needs of users of POC, training of scientists, funding scientists and engineers for development of prototype and mature POC technologies, and pilot testing and implementation of POC tests in diverse clinical settings, which will lead to the commercialization and use of POC tests for diagnosing STDs in order to improve the sexual health of individuals in the United States and the rest of the world. Narrative Overall Component The relevance of this project to public health is that by use of Point-of Care tests to rapidly and accurately diagnose sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), the sexual health of individuals in both the U.S. and in resource poor settings throughout the world will be improved.

"MACS/WIHS -CCS ABSTRACT Nearly half the men and women with HIV infection are racial/ethnic minorities living in the South. HIV infection remains a major public health problem despite the availability of treatments. The purpose of this proposal is to advance the knowledge of the consequences of HIV infection, with a focus on HIV-related comorbidities, by participating as a Clinical Research Sites (CRS) of the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS). To meet this goal, Miami will provide expertise to lead important components of the CCS unified science agenda with protocol development and laboratory support to protocols and sub studies, as well as implementing the full CCS unified science agenda. To accomplish this, we will enroll and follow 500 men and women with HIV infection or at risk for HIV. We will enroll approximately 250 men reflective of the HIV epidemic in Miami, and follow men who have sex with men, bisexual men, and heterosexual men including men who are black or Hispanic representing a large minority proportion. As a current Southern WIHS site we will continue to follow the 149 women enrolled in WIHS who have HIV infection or at risk for HIV and are largely minority reflecting the Miami HIV epidemic. With availability of the CCS protocol, we will enroll additional 100 women from the community to reach a goal of approximately 250 women. The men and women enrolled will be consistent with protocol requirements of the MACS/WIHS consortium for new enrollments. Miami will continue its strong leadership, as we provided for the WIHS. Dr. Fischl as lead PI for this multiple PI proposal is the Vice Chair of the WIHS and has had an active role, along with colleagues, in the development of the unified science agenda, including the specific aims, frequency of core protocol visits, and timing of clinical tests, specimen collections, surveys, assessments and clinical tests. The Miami CRS will focus on protocols and sub studies in several innovative areas.1. Explore cardiovascular outcomes and HIV progression in the syndemic of HIV, tobacco, stimulant use, and depression, and investigate inflammatory biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk and immune activation, including sex differences. 2. Explore the effects of the oral, female genital, and gut microbiome on the HIV reservoir and on exposure to antiretroviral therapy. 3. Evaluate comorbidities and effect of HIV persistence, inflammation and immune markers on comorbidity outcomes and plasma markers of inflammation, amyloid pathology and innate immune cell phenotypes on disease outcomes. 4. Examine the trajectories of vulnerabilities and resiliencies and relationship to HIV outcomes and comorbidities, and mechanisms by which psychosocial and behavioral predictors affect outcomes. 5. Examine the biological pathway whereby psychosocial factors and substance use may increase cardiovascular disease, impair neurocognitive function and contribute to HIV persistence. 5.

"Reducing Black Men's Drug Use and Co-Occurring Negative Mental and Physical Health Outcomes: Intersectionality,Social-Structural Stressors, and Protective Factors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The mixed methods explanatory-sequential (QUANT→quant) parent study will test a conceptual model of social-structural stressors, protective factors, and drug use and co-occurring negative mental and physical health outcomes among Black men at the intersection of sexual identity and socioeconomic position (SEP). Informed by the intersectionality theoretical framework, the initial design for the parent study provided for three sexual identity categories (i.e., gay, bisexual, and heterosexual) and two SEP positions (i.e., lower, higher) and a sample size of 1,440 (i.e., 240 participants for each of the 6 sampling frames: lower- SEP gay, lower-SEP bisexual, lower-SEP heterosexual, higher-SEP gay, higher-SEP bisexual, higher-SEP heterosexual). The considerable challenges involved in recruiting bisexual men and doing so at two different SEP-categories, was methodologically infeasible given the study's 5-year timeframe and limited resources. Thus a single sexual minority (SM) category composed of gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men was created to produce a sampling frame stratified by just two sexual identity positions (i.e., SM and heterosexual). A determination was made that this sampling frame was more methodologically feasible in terms of recruitment because it provided for a sample size of 960 (i.e., 240 participants each of lower-SEP SM, lower-SEP heterosexual, higher-SEP SM, higher-SEP heterosexual). To address the critical gaps that exist about Black bisexual men's health, the goal of the proposed administrative supplement is to increase the number of Black bisexual men participants and establish bisexual men as a distinct SM position for all of the parent study's analyses. To accomplish this goal, an academic-community partnership will be established with BiNet USA, the oldest national bisexual organization in the U.S. The proposed supplement adds new primary inferential and exploratory analyses specific to bisexual men (Aim 1, parent study). It also adds a convergent mixed methods design component in Phase I in which in-depth qualitative interviews will be conducted during the Phase I quantitative analyses with 30 purposively sampled Phase I quantitative bisexual participants. The interviews will facilitate a rich, culturally and contextually-grounded understanding of Black bisexual men's experiences relevant to the parent study's focus, as well as their intersectionality-specific experiences (e.g., binegativity). For Aim 3 of the parent study, Phases II (Focus Groups to Explain the Phase I Quantitative Results) and III (Mixed Methods Syntheses and Assessment of Validity) are unchanged. Bisexual participants will be purposively sampled for the Phase II focus groups. Phase III quantitative and qualitative synthesis analyses will assess the convergence and divergence of results for bisexual participants. This specific focus on bisexual participants represents a paradigmatic shift in sexual minority research. The significance of the proposed research lies in the expected outcome of the future development of multilevel interventions to reduce drug use and promote mental and physical health for Black bisexual men. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed administrative supplement to increase the number of Black bisexual men participants and establish bisexual men as a distinct sexual minority position is relevant to public health because it aligns with the NIH's Sexual and Gender Minority Research Office's recognition of the dearth of health research focused on bisexual people, and the need to prioritize intersectional bisexual health research. A significant benefit of the proposed research is that it will have broad translational importance for future health disparities research and interventions designed to reduce drug use and health disparities for Black bisexual men. The project advances new horizons about the effects of social-structural stressors and protective factors on Black bisexual men's drug use and co-occurring negative mental and physical health outcomes that are obscured by health disparities research that: (1) implicitly assumes that Black gay and bisexual men are a homogenous group; and/or (2) rarely reports results specific to Black bisexual men.","Reducing Black Men's Drug Use and Co-Occurring Negative Mental and Physical Health Outcomes: Intersectionality,Social-Structural Stressors, and Protective Factors",10093425,R01DA045773,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Award ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Homicide ', ' Interview ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nicotine ', ' Parents ', ' Political Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Washington ', ' Police ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Unintentional Injury ', ' Accidental Injury ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Area ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Phase ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Sample Size ', ' Gays ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social position ', ' social standing ', ' Social status ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', "" men's health "", ' male health ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' sexual minority ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' health data ', ' community partnership ', ' illicit drug use ', ' intersectionalities ', ' intersectionality ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' sexual identity ', ' health goals ', ' social factors ', ' social structural ', ' socio-structural ', ' sociostructural ', ' social structure ', ' ']",NIDA,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,99873,0.06640905039480763

"Epidemiology of Obesity, Diabetes, and Hypertension in African Caribbeans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Obesity is a very strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension, which disproportionately affect African ancestry populations. The Caribbean region in particular is experiencing an enormous epidemic of cardio-metabolic disease, with obesity, T2D, and hypertension being considerably higher in African Caribbeans compared to Caribbeans of other race/ethnicities. Despite the current and projected growth in obesity, T2D and hypertension among African Caribbeans, the mechanisms underlying racial/ethnic disparities in these devastating and costly conditions remain largely unknown. T2D and hypertension are driven in part by obesity and body fat distribution, especially fat around and within non-adipose tissue organs (known as ectopic adiposity). Our recent discovery that ectopic skeletal muscle adiposity contributes to incident T2D and hypertension in African Caribbean men supports the hypothesis that ectopic adiposity may be a key risk factor contributing to increased risk of T2D and hypertension in African Caribbean populations. However, in contrast to African Caribbean men, very little is known about the importance of body fat distribution and ectopic adiposity for T2D, hypertension, and resultant cardiovascular disease in African Caribbean women. Our preliminary data underscores the need to extend research to include African Caribbean women to unravel the sex-specific and obesity-related mechanisms for T2D, hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to discover novel factors related to these major conditions in African ancestry populations. Over the past 20 years we have been studying a unique population-based cohort of African Caribbean men from Tobago. We now propose to expand our research on obesity, T2D, hypertension, and CVD among African Caribbean men to include African Caribbean women in Tobago. We will collect data on lifestyle and medical factors, anthropometrics, DXA and CT body composition measures, carotid ultrasound measures of subclinical cardiovascular disease, and create a specimen biobank for future proposals using our existing infrastructure and well-established procedures. In these newly recruited women, we propose to: 1) determine the overall, and age- and BMI- specific prevalence of T2D and hypertension in African Caribbean women in Tobago, and compare the prevalence with our existing data in men; 2) identify traditional and novel lifestyle, cultural, behavioral, reproductive, nutritional, and medical-related risk factors for T2D and hypertension among African Caribbean women, and 3) evaluate the association of body fat distribution and ectopic adiposity in African Caribbean women with prevalent T2D and hypertension, and compare these associations with those previously observed in African Caribbean men. In addition to accomplishing these aims, the collection and archiving of vital specimens and measures (e.g., fecal samples for microbial distribution; DNA and RNA extraction for omics based approaches), and reading of archived vascular images for subclinical CVD will create the foundation for subsequent, focused funding proposals. Finally, combined with our existing data in men, our study will provide a rich resource for the long-term study of cardio-metabolic health among African Caribbeans and enable future comparisons to similarly phenotyped cohorts of African Americans.

In this study, we will expand our research on these cardio-metabolic diseases among African Caribbean men to include African Caribbean women in Tobago, and conduct a comprehensive epidemiological study of these devastating and costly diseases. Our study will have a substantial impact on the field by providing new insight on of cardio-metabolic disease in a high-risk, African Caribbean population, and will enable future comparisons to similar cohorts of African Americans.","Epidemiology of Obesity, Diabetes, and Hypertension in African Caribbeans",9987735,R01HL143793,"['Adipose tissue ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' adipose ', ' white

"Examining Modifiable Psychosocial Predictors of HIV Seroconversion in a Large Nationwide Cohort of High Risk Men Project Summary Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) remain a population in the U.S. for whom the burden of HIV is high and disproportionate, particularly among younger GBMSM and GBMSM of color, for whom HIV incidence continues to rise despite decades of HIV prevention research to curb the epidemic. However, even among these highest risk groups, risk for infection is not equivalent and the goal of this study is to better understand what factors differentiate levels of risk for HIV infection. Research to date suggests that this disproportionate burden is likely to be exacerbated by psychosocial disparities faced by this population in the form of syndemics and sexual minority stress. However, research on these factors has been limited by a focus on risk for HIV infection operationalized as risk behavior or cross-sectional prevalence of HIV, making actual vulnerability to infection and temporal associations difficult, if not impossible, to determine. We are submitting this application in response to RFA-AI-16-031 Limited Interaction Targeted Epidemiology (LITE) to Advance HIV Prevention (UG3/UH3). We propose to recruit and enroll a large and diverse cohort of approximately 8,000 GBMSM ages 16 and older in the U.S. and Puerto Rico who are at high risk for infection. We will utilize mobile sexual networking applications (“mobile apps”) to identify and enroll these men both to allow for rapid and efficient recruitment and because these apps rapidly increasing in popularity, with research demonstrating that men who use mobile apps are at higher levels of risk for HIV infection than GBMSM recruited through other means. Using this cohort, we will work to achieve three primary aims: (1) we will establish HIV prevalence as well as prevalence of rectal sexually transmitted infections (STIs; gonorrhea and chlamydia) at baseline and subsequently establish rates of HIV and rectal STI incidence among these men 12 months thereafter; (2) we will utilize baseline levels of syndemic, minority stress, and other relevant psychosocial risk factors to develop a model of those modifiable factors that contribute to increased risk for HIV seroconversion (i.e., incidence) as well as rectal STI infection; (3) we will utilize the model to target men in the highest quartile of risk for HIV seroconversion in the cohort and follow them every 6 months thereafter for an additional two years to examine the predictive utility in prospectively predicting HIV seroconversion as well as time to seroconversion. Developing a model of modifiable psychosocial risk factors for actual HIV seroconversion and subsequently testing its reliability and validity in a prospective design has high potential to improve the next generation of HIV prevention interventions aimed at reducing disparities for this population. Project Narrative Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are at disproportionately high risk for HIV infection compared to other groups, but little research has been powered to examine factors associated with their increased susceptibility as measured with biological indicators and prospective HIV serconversion (i.e., incidence). In this study, we will establish a large nationwide cohort of GBMSM at risk for HIV and follow them longitudinally to examine psychosocial predictors of seroconversion. Specifically, we will integrate two prominent psychosocial models of HIV risk for GBMSM—syndemics and minority stress—to identify modifiable targets for future intervention that increase are associated with risk for HIV as measured by rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia infection in addition to actual HIV infection (i.e., seroconversion).",Examining Modifiable Psychosocial Predictors of HIV Seroconversion in a Large Nationwide Cohort of High Risk Men,9986637,UH3AI133674,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Child Sexual Abuse ', ' Child Sexual Molestation ', ' childhood sexual abuse ', ' juvenile sex abuse ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' bedsonia ', ' Chlamydia Infections ', ' Chlamydial Infection ', ' chlamydial disease ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Color ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' rectal ', ' Distal ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Gays ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention program ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' high risk ', ' HIV/STI ', ' STD/HIV ', ' STI/HIV ', ' HIV/STD ', ' sexual minority ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' seroconversion ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' recruit ', ' infection risk ', ' anal intercourse without condom ', ' anal sex without condom ', ' condomless anal intercourse ', ' unprotected anal intercourse ', ' unprotected anal sex ', ' unsafe anal intercourse ', ' unsafe anal sex ', ' condomless anal sex ', ' rate of infection ', ' infection rate ', ' ']",NIAID,HUNTER COLLEGE,UH3,2020,1536639,0.030931711783501466
"Sexual and Gender Minority Supplement PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Despite much research in chronic disease self-management, significant gaps in knowledge still exist, especially regarding vulnerable and underserved populations. More specifically, African American gay men are disproportionately affected by chronic conditions, especially coping with multiple morbidities. Low-income African American gay men also experience additional burdens to health related to stigma, discrimination, cultural beliefs and practices about health, knowledge and perceptions regarding chronic conditions, and lack of support systems, creating even greater health inequalities. The critical intersections of socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and multiple diagnoses strongly influence effective self-management skills and access to support systems. The specific aims for this sexual and gender minority supplement to Healthy Together: A Self-Management and Support Intervention for Low-Income African American Men with Multiple Chronic Conditions” include: AIM 1: Build a community of practice focusing specifically focusing on African American gay men, particularly low-income. AIM 2: Conduct qualitative interviews with 25-30 African American gay men who are living with chronic conditions, including HIV, diabetes, hypertension, hyper-cholesterolemia, asthma, arthritis, and mental illness as well as 8-12 health care providers serving this population. AIM 3: Based on Aim 2, develop and implement a survey regarding the needs and challenges of managing chronic conditions as an African American gay man. The purpose of this study is to carefully examine the development and effectiveness of specifically focusing on the needs of gender and sexual minorities within a chronic disease self-management program, including both chronic physical and mental conditions, as well as those who care for them. This innovative study engages the research participants through community based participatory research to address the complexities of related to effectively managing their chronic diseases among African American gay men. This will advance the science needed to achieve the clinically important outcomes such as minimizing disability, optimizing function, and living well among all patients.

"Sexual Orientation, Discrimination, and Health Disparities in DSM-5 Alcohol Use Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In response to PAR-14-338: Secondary Analyses of Existing Alcohol Epidemiology Data, this project Sexual Orientation, Discrimination, and Health Disparities in DSM-5 Alcohol Use Disorders proposes to use existing alcohol epidemiological data to examine relationships among sexual orientation, childhood adversity, sexual orientation discrimination (individual-level and institutional-level), recent stressful events and DSM-5 alcohol use disorders (AUDs). AUDs are among the most prevalent mental health disorders and contribute substantially to morbidity and mortality worldwide. Over 65 million adults in the U.S. will meet criteria for a DSM-5 AUD, with past research finding that sexual minorities are at disproportionately high risk for AUD. To date, no large-scale nationally representative studies have examined sexual-orientation-related health disparities in DSM-5 AUD and there is limited data on DSM-5 AUD severity, comorbidity, and disability among sexual minorities. A significant gap in knowledge remains regarding the underlying reasons why sexual minorities are more likely to meet criteria for DSM-5 AUD. Thus, we propose to build on our prior work by conducting secondary analyses using the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC-III), a nationally representative sample of 36,309 U.S. adults. The NESARC-III is the only nationally representative study that has sufficient measures and sample size to test for potential age, gender, racial/ethnic and sexual orientation differences and to meet the objectives of our study, which aims to: (1) estimate the prevalence of (a) DSM-5 AUD diagnoses including severity (mild, moderate and severe), (b) identify potential differences in AUD diagnoses between DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria, and (c) examine DSM-5 psychiatric comorbidity associated with DSM-5 AUD based on sexual orientation (attraction, behavior, and identity); (2) assess the disability (social functioning), help seeking (e.g., self-help), and recovery (e.g., abstinence) associated with DSM-5 AUD based on sexual orientation; and (3) examine risk factors (e.g., individual- and institutional-level sexual orientation discrimination, and stressful life events). Analyses will focus on multiple developmental domains (i.e., childhood, adolescence, adulthood, past-year) and potential moderators (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, and childhood adversity) associated with DSM-5 AUD severity, psychiatric comorbidity, and disability among sexual minorities. The proposed project will benefit from the unique opportunities afforded by the 2012-2013 NESARC such as: the largest nationally representative sample of sexual minority women and men currently available; the assessment of all three major dimensions of sexual orientation (attraction, behavior and identity); and the wealth of data on DSM-5 AUD and other psychiatric disorders. We will also examine the impact of changes from the DSM-IV to DSM-5 for AUDs among sexual minorities. The project uses a theory-driven approach in assessing how childhood adversity, sexual orientation discrimination, and recent stressors contribute to alcohol-related health disparities based on sexual orientation. PROJECT NARRATIVE To date, there is limited knowledge regarding the epidemiology and etiology of DSM-5 alcohol use disorders among sexual minorities in the United States. The proposed study will help inform prevention and intervention efforts to reduce DSM-5 alcohol use disorders by examining the prevalence, severity, comorbidity, disability, help seeking, recovery, and risk factors associated with DSM-5 alcohol use disorders across sub-groups based on dimensions of sexual orientation in the United States. Findings will help guide future research by providing new information about the underlying mechanisms associated with alcohol use disorders across dimensions of sexual orientation, and about the impact of individual-level sexual orientation discrimination, institutional-level sexual orientation discrimination, and recent stressful life events on DSM-5 alcohol use disorders among sexual minorities.","Sexual Orientation, Discrimination, and Health Disparities in DSM-5 Alcohol Use Disorders",9858165,R01AA025684,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Grant ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Literature ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Peer Review ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Stress ', ' Stressful Event ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' DSM-4 ', ' DSM4 ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV ', ' DSM-IV ', ' disability ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Sample Size ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' self help ', ' stressor ', ' Manuscripts ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' DSM-5 ', ' DSM5 ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' DSM-V ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Economic Burden ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' comparator group ', ' comparison group ', ' Social Functioning ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Abstinence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' alcohol epidemiology ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' alcohol risk ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' sexual minority ', ' LGB ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' secondary analysis ', ' sexual identity ', ' pediatric adversity ', ' childhood adversity ', ' ']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,281337,0.02807069979902859
"Recapitulation of sex- disparity in PAH on a microfluidic device and elucidation of  the differences and similarities  in the development, progression and therapy of PAH in male versus female patients Project Summary: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a lethal disease that affects ~4 times as many women as men. Ironically, female patients fare better than male patients; women with PAH live 2 years longer than their male counterparts. Patient responses to existing PAH therapies also vary depending on sex. These gender disparities in PAH may stem, at least in part, from intrinsic differences between the two sexes and from the conflicting roles of sex hormones, especially estrogen. Estrogen increases the pathologic proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells, but it also protects against right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). The role of the male sex hormone testosterone in PAH is poorly defined but it appears to have a part in promoting RVH in men. Progress in understanding the sex- disparity in PAH has been slow, primarily because of the lack of experimental models that can recapitulate human PAH in its sex-specific forms. Existing animal and cellular models, while having aided in addressing many important questions, do not accurately portray the sex-related variability in PAH development and progression, nor are they sufficiently malleable for certain mechanistic studies. A human tissue-chip model of PAH—able to capture its sex- specific disease etiology, reproduce PAH-induced RVH, and simulate sex-specific responses to drug therapy— could provide a much-needed breakthrough in understanding the mechanism of the sex disparity in PAH and lead to improved treatments for PAH patients. Recently, we designed and fabricated such a device, a state-of-the-art microfluidic tissue-chip that mimics the five layers of the pulmonary artery (perivascular, adventitial, medial, intimal and luminal), both normal and diseased. Further, in preliminary studies, we demonstrated that our tissue-chip can recreate PAH-afflicted pulmonary arteries, emulate the severity of the disease, and model the differences in the therapeutic response of male versus female patients. Here, we propose to deploy our new device to study the pathophysiology of different forms of PAH, investigate the influence of sex and sex hormones on development and progression of the disease, and assess the relative efficacies of mono and combination therapies in both sexes. We will also modify the chip to reconstruct PAH-induced RVH to study how intercellular communication between cardiac cells and cells of PAH-afflicted pulmonary arteries contributes to the pathology, and evaluate the effect of drugs on PAH-induced RVH. This is an exceptionally innovative project with far-reaching clinical significance, as it combines the power of microfluidic technology with the flexibility of combinatorial study design to elucidate the pathomechanism of PAH in both women and men. The investigative team, comprising a pharmaceutical scientist with a longstanding interest in PAH, a chemical engineer, an expert in microfluidic technology, two physician scientists, and a PAH biologist, is highly qualified to conduct this study. If successful, this tissue-chip model may revolutionize approaches to studying sex-based pathophysiology and therapy for vascular diseases, and enable clinicians to develop personalized therapies for their PAH patients. Project Narrative: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a little-known disease, causes narrowing and blockage of the blood vessels (pulmonary arteries/arterioles) that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. The disease affects significantly more women than men; up to 10 times, depending on the PAH subtype. Paradoxically, female patients live longer and fare better with the disease than male patients. PAH researchers have been using various animal models to study the gender paradox in PAH. However, none of the existing models can imitate the sex-specific variation in PAH nor have they brought us closer to an effective therapy. In this project, we are proposing to deploy a newly developed, miniaturized device which incorporates patient cells to closely mimic PAH of both male and female patients. We will use this device to model and elucidate the sex-based differences in the development, progression, and therapy of the disease. We believe, if successful, clinicians may one day use the device to prescribe better, personalized treatments for patients.","Recapitulation of sex- disparity in PAH on a microfluidic device and

"Center for Point-of-Care Technologies Research for Sexually Transmitted Diseases Project Summary The long-term goals of our center include addressing the epidemics of STDs/HIV in the U.S. and in resource-poor settings by development and better use of Point-of-Care (POC) tests, so as to address health inequity and improve the sexual health of individuals. Our specific aims are: 1. To develop a “Center of Excellence for the Development and Testing of Point of Care Tests (POCT) for Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)” with cores that can: drive the development and application of point-of-care technologies via collaborative efforts that merge scientific and technological capabilities with clinical need and training of developers, as well as end users of POCT. 2. To use clinical drivers of technology progression for developing and expanding existing POC STD technologies, by providing assistance and feed back in an iterative fashion to developers in a “go-no go” manner, such that we insure that deliverables for each project are met. 3. To implement functioning core components that work smoothly together in a collaborative fashion and with other members of the Point-of-Care Technologies Research Network (POCTRN), which can work with our administrative component to implement a smooth transition along a pipeline from developmental prototype assays through early in- house, clinical translation and validation testing, In this coordinated manner, we can assist with the logical development of POC assays, which prove to have qualifications of sufficient scientific merit and can progress towards eventual FDA submission and commercialization.  These goals and aims will be accomplished by an effective administrative component, ascertaining needs of users of POC, training of scientists, funding scientists and engineers for development of prototype and mature POC technologies, and pilot testing and implementation of POC tests in diverse clinical settings, which will lead to the commercialization and use of POC tests for diagnosing STDs in order to improve the sexual health of individuals in the United States and the rest of the world. Narrative Overall Component The relevance of this project to public health is that by use of Point-of Care tests to rapidly and accurately diagnose sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), the sexual health of individuals in both the U.S. and in resource poor settings throughout the world will be improved.

"MWCCS Covid-19 Supplement Activities ABSTRACT COVID-19 cases continue to rise, with over 3,000,000 cases and 130,000 deaths in the US and almost 12 million cases worldwide to date. Manifestations of SARS CoV-2 infection range from asymptomatic to mild, moderate, or severe disease, and primarily affects the lung, but increasing data suggests involvement of other organ and blood systems. Studies document more severe disease and higher mortality among people who are older and/or have co-morbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and chronic lung disease. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the acquisition, occurrence and severity of infection among people with HIV (PWH). There is also little data to guide prevention and treatment recommendations for this population, many of whom are older and have comorbidities that may increase not only their risk for acquiring infection, but also the morbidity and mortality among those who acquire infection. Moreover, early reports suggest substantial racial disparities in US COVID-19 rates, with increases in mortality among African Americans. The MACS- WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS), the largest and longest-running observational cohort of men and women living with or at risk for HIV in the US provides a unique opportunity to address important knowledge gaps in the acquisition, occurrence, severity and outcomes of COVID-19. The MWCCS is a geographically and racially/ethnically diverse cohort of aging men and women with a high prevalence of risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19 disease including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and smoking. The MWCCS has a rich biorepository of specimens, collects rigorous clinical measures including pulmonary, cardiac, kidney, neurocognitive, and physical function, body composition and has performed cohort-wide genome association studies. The overarching goal of this application is to understand the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic among US men and women with or at risk for HIV infection and to evaluate host factors that contribute to disease acquisition, expression, severity and recovery. The proposed studies will determine COVID incidence, short- term and long-term clinical outcomes, including thrombotic and pulmonary sequelae, and how racial and geographic disparities; immune and genetic risk factors impact these outcomes in the MWCCS. Narrative This research would contribute to improved understanding of COVID-19 manifestations, the social factors that drive distribution and outcomes of disease in vulnerable populations, pathophysiologic and genetic factors, as well as the interactions between comorbid conditions, such as HIV. Improved understanding of these factors could improve care and aid development of therapies, and inform efforts to control future outbreaks.",MWCCS Covid-19 Supplement

"Surviving the HIV Epidemic (S/HE) in metropolitan Washington DC - Advancing knowledge through cohort studies ABSTRACT About 1.1 million people are living with HIV (PLWH) in the US, with an estimated 39,782 individuals newly diagnosed with HIV in 2016. The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) are two of the longest standing HIV cohort studies in the United States. Established in 1984 and 1993, respectively, these US-based cohorts currently follow 2,235 men and 2,304 women living with HIV, alongside high-risk but uninfected controls. HIV is at epidemic proportions in the nation’s capital, with overall HIV prevalence of 1.9% among the District of Columbia (DC) adult and adolescent residents. Approximately 3.7% of DC residents aged 40 to 49 years and 5.2% of residents aged 50 to 59 years are living with HIV. The highest life time risk of acquiring HIV in the U.S. is highest in DC with an estimated 1 in 17 individuals anticipated to acquire HIV in their lifetime, followed by 1 in 56 risk among the neighboring Maryland residents. Continuing to follow the women we have recruited and expanding our cohort to include a representative group of men and women is imperative in this region with epidemic levels of HIV. Our research will be focused on understanding the behavioral and social determinants that contribute to long term treatment success and failure, with a focus on identifying key resilience factors that may translate into innovative interventions to achieve the global goals of the HIV care continuum, to improve treatment uptake and viral suppression to decrease morbidity and mortality. We have four aims to achieve our goals. (1) To continue our strong collaborative relationship with the national MACS/WIHS CCS in protocol development, implementation, participant enrollment, retention, data acquisition, and sub-study participation; (2) To lead the CCS-wide effort to understand the psychosocial and behavioral determinants that contributes to treatment adherence, virologic suppression, and healthy coping among PLWH in the US; (3) To determine the effectiveness of treatment and prevention guidelines and identify disparities in service delivery for common morbidities with high associated mortality; and (4) To explore HIV, aging, and associated co-morbidities, including the role of microvascular/vascular function, the microbiome, neurocognitive decline in the context of contemporary antiretroviral treatment regimens, and hearing and balance disorders among men and women. Our long-term goal is to improve the health of people living with HIV and to help prevent those without HIV from seroconverting. NARRATIVE HIV is a treatable and preventable disease but there are individuals who have not benefited from therapies to control the virus, improve health, and decrease transmission. We hope to understand why this happens to certain individuals, and develop tools to improve HIV treatment and prevention.",Surviving the HIV Epidemic (S/HE) in metropolitan Washington DC - Advancing knowledge through cohort studies,9903483,U01HL146205,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Capital ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' District of Columbia ', ' D.C.

"Influences on risk behaviors among young men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate. I pursue this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) to facilitate my transition towards an independent research career in HIV prevention science. My long-term goal is to become a productive independent HIV prevention behavioral scientist. My goals include the development of HIV prevention interventions - using new and increasingly accessible and influential online media - to address disparities among sexual minority populations across key developmental periods. To date, my training has focused on core strengths and skills in clinical psychology (PhD) and epidemiology (MPH). I have acquired expertise in HIV prevention, behavior change theory, and research methods, with an emphasis on adults. This foundation has prepared me for the proposed next steps of my training, namely, developing expertise in adolescent risk behavior (the time when most risk behavior patterns are established) and the skills necessary for the development, implementation, and evaluation of online prevention interventions and research.  Training plan. The proposed training plan will prepare me to work with adolescent sexual minority populations, a group at significant risk for HIV. Receipt of a K23 award will allow me protected time to acquire the necessary skills. Specifically, with the K23 training I will: (1) acquire the theoretical and methodological skills required for HIV prevention interventions targeting sexual minority populations during adolescence; (2) gain hands-on training in online media-based intervention development, including health communications and media literacy skills; and (3) build the necessary collaboration networks and research infrastructure to enable independence as an NIH-funded investigator. Importantly my training will also increase my sophistication regarding the (4) unique ethical challenges involved in (a) working with a young, often stigmatized population, and (b) delivering online interventions. Both domains are fraught with ethical complexities (e.g., privacy, consent, confidentiality) at a time of rapidly-evolving societal, cultural, health, and technological changes. My training will prepare me to take a leadership role in this emerging and complex research area. Training goals will be achieved through didactic courses, workshops, research experience, and mentoring.  Environment. During the proposed K23, I will be a Research Scientist at The Miriam Hospital and an Assistant Professor at Brown University. At the Miriam, I will have access to the outstanding and highly supportive research environments provided by the Centers for Behavioral and Preventive Medicine and the Centers for AIDS Research. At Brown University, I will have access to the academic resources of the Schools of Medicine and Public Health, including the Alcohol Research Center on HIV. This environment will enhance my training and facilitate my research goals. Through the training, experience, and skills gained as a part of this K23 Award, I will be prepared to pursue funding to conduct a larger randomized controlled trial of an intervention to reduce HIV risk among adolescent sexual minority populations.  Mentors. I will receive mentoring from an outstanding team of internationally recognized and accomplished investigators in HIV prevention and behavioral science, public health, communications, and media literacy.  Proposed research. Young sexual minority males account for a disproportionate number of HIV infections in the United States. Racial and ethnic minority populations are particularly affected. Incidence rates reflect sexual risk behaviors during early sexual experiences. Research suggests that initial sexual risk-taking occurs during adolescence (ages 14-18) among sexual minority males. Therefore, it is important for HIV prevention interventions to target adolescent sexual minority males. Targeting sexual minority males during adolescence will help them learn and establish healthy sexual behaviors early in their psychosexual development, which will have both immediate and long-term health benefits.  Online media use triggers and maintains sexual risk-taking among adolescent sexual minority males. Consequently, it is critical for HIV prevention interventions to address the influence of online media on this population. One way to address this influence is by developing an online sexual health media literacy intervention. To promote adolescent sexual minority males' critical examination of online media and to decrease their sexual risk-taking, I propose a two-stage program of research (i.e., formative research and an exploratory clinical trial) with three aims: (1) develop methods to recruit and retain a racially/ethnically diverse sample of adolescent sexual minority males online using feedback from five focus groups (N ~ 30); (2) develop a brief, online-administered, sexual health media literacy intervention to lower HIV risk behaviors among adolescent sexual minority males using information from a youth advisory board (N ~ 8) and a cross-sectional online survey (N = 200); and (3) conduct an exploratory clinical trial to pilot test the developed online sexual health media literacy intervention for feasibility and acceptability (N = 100). Overall, the proposed research has the potential to reach a wide audience of sexual minority males early in their sexual development, ultimately decreasing their sexual risk-taking and reducing the number of new HIV infections in this population. Further, the proposed research will expand my capacities as an HIV researcher and interventionist and place me at the forefront of online media-based HIV prevention research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adolescent sexual minority males account for a disproportionate number of new HIV infections in the United States. There is an urgent need for innovative prevention methods for this at-risk group. The proposed research will take advantage the Internet to reach this group - often hidden and difficult to access - early in their development in order to provide them with prevention programming to help them learn and establish healthy sexual behaviors.",Influences on risk behaviors among young men,9912192,K23MH109346,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune

"Sexual Orientation/Gender Identity, Socioeconomic Status, and Health across the Life Course Abstract Socioeconomic status (SES) is a fundamental contributor to health and disease across the life course. Inequalities in health that disfavor sexual and gender minorities have been widely documented in both adolescence and adulthood. Despite the importance of SES to health, knowledge about factors that pattern these resources and strains across sexual and gender minority groups is incomplete, largely because of the absence of appropriate and high quality data, as well as study design limitations for data that do exist. In synchrony with the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) Wave V program project design and activity, this proposed ancillary project will collect, clean, disseminate, and analyze new data from a subset of the Add Health cohort (sexual minorities, transgendered individuals, and a comparison sample of heterosexuals) via a theory-guided ancillary survey that will add information about formative experiences more specific to sexual orientation and gender development, and enhance existing prospective information about SES and determinants of SES. Based on Wave IV data we plan to recruit approximately 2,200 self-identified sexual/gender minorities and a random comparison sample of 1,500 heterosexuals. The unique data collected via this project will provide an unprecedented opportunity for new and current Add Health users to prospectively study the intersections of sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic factors, and health in a population-based sample across the life course at only marginal cost. Positioned within a life course framework and guided by Minority Stress Theory, we will also address three substantive analytical aims using the released ancillary data: 1) to describe the timing and sequence of theoretical milestones in the development of sexual orientation and gender identity; 2) to examine potential mediators (i.e., parent-child relationship quality and subsequent adolescent educational attainment and housing status) of the association between sexual orientation, gender identity, and young adult SES; and 3) to test a hypothesized pathway that economic strain heightens stress, which in turn elevates depressive symptoms. Findings made possible through these new data, in combination with existing longitudinal information about Add Health sample members, have the potential for critical impact on public health policy and intervention strategies to reduce the prevalence of and disparities in disease burden for the sexual and gender minority population. Project Narrative Despite the importance of socioeconomic status to health and documented health inequalities that disfavor sexual and gender minorities, knowledge about factors that pattern these resources and strains across sexual and gender minority groups is incomplete, largely because of the absence of appropriate and high quality data. This cost effective project will build on the population-based National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health by collecting and disseminating data to address these critical knowledge gaps and by testing hypotheses linking economic strain and health across the life course to inform public health policy and interventions.","Sexual Orientation/Gender Identity, Socioeconomic Status, and Health across the Life Course",9947975,R01HD087365,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Family ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' parent child interaction ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' data quality ', ' Inequality ', ' Re 80 ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Collaborations ', ' Respondent ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' health knowledge ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' experience ', ' intergenerational ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Monitor ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' population based ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' health inequalities ', ' sexual minority ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' LGB ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual ', ' data resource ', ' recruit ', ' data cleansing ', ' data cleaning ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,709115,0.02568274188127821
"Optimizing event-level measures of intersectional stigma for HIV prevention with young sexual minority men Project Summary Gay, bisexual, and other sexual minority men (SMM) are the group most impacted by the domestic HIV epidemic. Critically, these rates are highest among young SMM (YSMM), with Black, Latino, and White YSMM under age 35 being the three groups with the highest rates of new HIV diagnoses in 2016. Although more is known about sexual minority stigma (i.e., internalized homonegativity), little quantitative work has focused on intersectional experiences of stigma for diverse YSMM. Compared to White YSMM, intersectionality theory suggests that increased HIV incidence among Black and Latino YSMM may due in part to the distinct effects of stigma that occurs at the intersection of their multiple stigmatized identities. Researchers have consistently found that exposure to sexual minority stigma at least partially explains the disproportionate experience of adverse mental and physical health outcomes for SMM compared to the general population, though the literature on intersectional stigma and HIV prevention for YSMM is less well developed. Experiences of stigma occur regularly and are shaped by the context in which they occur, and event-level methodologies may be an ideal way to collect such data. Although a few event-level studies of stigma have been published, few if any have used rigorously developed, community-informed, and psychometrically validated items. To address these limitations of the literature to date, the goal of this research is to conduct a three-phase study to generate, refine, and optimize event-level measures of stigma for Black, Latino, and White YSMM aged 16-29 that focus on the intersection of race, ethnicity, sexual minority identity, and gender performance (i.e., masculinity). The first aim of the study is to generate and refine an item pool using the available literature and interviews with expert researchers and community members (Phase 1) followed by an iterative process of cognitive interviewing and pilot testing of the items with YSMM themselves (Phase 2). Having generated an item pool, the second aim of the study is to use the items to conduct a 21-day daily diary study with 150 YSMM (Phase 3) to examine the psychometric properties of the items, reduce the item pool, and test the predictive validity of the items for three HIV prevention outcomes—HIV testing, STI testing, and rectal STI infection. To enroll YSMM for Phases 2 and 3, we will leverage an existing cohort to rapidly recruit participants; in Phase 3, we will also gather data collected during the cohort study both prior to and following the 21-day diary study. The proposed study will address a notable gap in the literature by systematically developing and optimizing items to capture event-level experiences of intersectional stigma for diverse YSMM across the U.S. Overall, the final item pool developed will help to further research on intersectional stigma and health disparities; generating items with greater cultural relevance and lower measurement error will enhance power to detect meaningful intervention effects in future research aiming to reduce intersectional stigma and disparities in HIV incidence for YSMM. Project Narrative Rates of new HIV infections are highest among young sexual minority men (YSMM) who are Black, Latino, or White, and intersectionality theory suggests that these disproportionately high rates of HIV incidence may due in part to the distinct effects of stigma that occurs at the intersection of their multiple stigmatized identities.

"Revealing women's hidden role as critical components of HIV transmission networks in Rakai, Uganda: an interdisciplinary approach ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The burden of HIV is ~60% higher in women than men in sub-Saharan Africa, and this gender inequity is a key challenge to HIV control. Identifying women at greatest risk for HIV and their infecting male partners is critical for effective, targeted control of the African HIV epidemic. It is also vital to identify those HIV-infected women most likely to contribute to ongoing viral spread. However, African women vastly underreport sexual contacts and high risk occupations such as sex work in interview-based surveys and clinical settings making their identification challenging. Here, we propose to use phylogenetic, epidemiological, and qualitative methods to study network drivers of female risk of HIV acquisition and onward transmission to men in the rural Rakai District, Uganda. We will use existing data from the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS), a population- based study of HIV incidence and behaviors in 50 communities (n~17,000). In Aim 1 we will identify HIV- infected women who have central roles in transmission networks using viral phylogenetics and then characterize them with RCCS epidemiological data. We will also conduct in-depth interviews with these women to gain deeper insight into their HIV-related risks and to understand the barriers to reporting these risks. In Aim 2 we will use viral phylogenetics in conjunction with probabilistic statistical models to identify the pool of infecting male partners tat sustain the excess HIV burden among Rakai women. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will use microsimulation models to estimate the potential effectiveness of various combination HIV prevention strategies targeted to high risk subgroups to reduce HIV incidence. The proposed research is part of a K01 award and will provide the applicant with the advanced training in HIV modelling, behavioral science, and phylogenetics necessary to transition to an independent investigator with expertise in the application of interdisciplinary methods to HIV epidemiology and prevention. Results will improve female HIV risk assessment and identify candidate targeted strategies to prevent HIV in African women. It also will provide critical formative data fr a future R01 to implement and empirically assess the effectiveness of targeted interventions to high risk women and their partners in Rakai. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The success of interventions to reduce female HIV risk depends upon an understanding of the drivers of excess HIV infection in women. This project studies network drivers of female HIV risk and onward transmission to men in rural Uganda using interdisciplinary methods. We also explore barriers to HIV risk assessment in a setting where women vastly underreport sex work and risky sexual partnerships. This study will inform targeted PEPFAR initiatives to prevent HIV in high risk African women such as DREAMS.","Revealing women's hidden role as critical components of HIV transmission networks in Rakai, Uganda: an interdisciplinary approach",9867619,K01AI125086,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Female ', ' Fishes ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Phylogeny ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Uganda ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Rural ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Viral Burden ', ' Viral Load ', ' Viral Load result ', ' Frequencies ', ' Source ', ' Viral ', ' success ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Abate ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Gifts ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Length ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' High Prevalence ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Phylogenetics ', ' Phylogenetic Analysis ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' demographics ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' data format ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' ']",NIAID,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,127678,0.03370268202158088

"Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center Project Summary  This application is for the renewal of the Study to Help the AIDS Research Effort (SHARE), which has been the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) since 1984. The MACS was established with sites in Baltimore-Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles, initially to study the natural history of HIV infection in men who have sex with men and later, with the advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the treated history of HIV infection, including the relationship between long-term controlled HIV infection and chronic diseases and co-morbidities associated with aging. To reflect these changing priorities in HIV research, SHARE has had subsequent enrollments to balance proportions of HIV- and HIV+ men and to reflect the HIV epidemic more accurately. Men enrolled have been followed semi annually since 1984 or enrollment and have a) provided questionnaire data, physical exam data, laboratory data (including HIV serostatus, T cell subset measurements, and HIV viral load measurements), and a large repository of plasma, serum, cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other specimens; and these have permitted SHARE and MACS to make major contributions to the understanding of treated and untreated HIV disease, and comorbidities associated with increased survival due to antiretroviral treatment.  The present application, in response to RFA-HL-19-008, aims to extend followup of the SHARE cohort (about 640 men) from 2019 to 2026, to allow merger of SHARE (and the other MACS sites) with the nine sites of the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) into a single cohort, termed the MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS), that will include both men and women. The specific aims of the CCS are outlined in a parallel application from the putative Data and Coordinating Center (DACC) of the CCS, and the 10 Specific Aims of that single cohort are outlined in the DACC application for the CCS; these include Cardiovascular (CV), Pulmonary/Sleep (PS), Neurocognitive NC), Aging (AG), Cancer, HIV Pathogenesis (PA), Psychosocial (PS), Health Disparities, Platform (PL), and Career Development (CD) Aims. The specific aims of the SHARE Clinical Research Site (CRS) are to: 1) play a leading role in the achievement 7 of these Aims by the CCS (i.e., CV, PS, AG, PA, PS, PL, and CD), including serving as a reading center for echocardiography and sleep studies; 2) to contribute to the achievement of the other 3 CCS aims, and 3) to implement all applicable CCS protocols and support the scientific goals of the CCS. Local initiatives on inflammation and physical activity will also support these aims, which take full advantage of the extensive follow-up and repository of biological specimens already available from this cohort and which will be extended under this proposal, enabling further contributions to our understanding and care of comorbidities and other health issues faced by people living with HIV today. Narrative This application is for renewal for 7 years of the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a longstanding study of the natural and treated histories of HIV infection men who have sex with men in four US cites (Baltimore-Washington, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Chicago) which has made many important contributions to the treatment and understanding of HIV infection since 1984. For the next 7 years, we propose to integrate our site with the 9 WIHS sites into a new MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS) which will follow men already enrolled in Baltimore and Washington, DC, and also recruit a few new men replacing those who have been lost to the study, in order to better understand the long-term consequences of living with HIV, including possible effects on chronic diseases and aging, and to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of these consequences.",Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center,9903475,U01HL146201,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Chicago ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cryopreservation ', ' Cryofixation ', ' cold preservation ', ' cold storage ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' District of Columbia ', ' D.C.

"The Role of VGLL3 in Sexually Dimorphic Interferon-Driven Inflammation PROJECT SUMMARY The candidate's long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator in the field of immune- associated diseases, with a focus on molecular mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphisms in immune disorders. Towards this goal, the career development plan will develop research and professional skills through a combination of research experience, clinical immersion, coursework, and additional professional training activities; all under the mentorship of an interdisciplinary group of experts. Specifically, it focuses on training in: 1) molecular aspects of cutaneous inflammation; 2) animal models for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases; 3) clinical aspects of autoimmune diseases; and 4) communication, collaboration, teaching, writing, and additional faculty skills.  In addition, the completion of the research project in the career development plan will lay the scientific groundwork for the candidate's future research. The research project is summarized below:  Sex disparity in the manifestation of immune diseases represents one of the most remarkable and unexplained examples of the biological differences between men and women. Many autoimmune diseases feature strikingly increased prevalence in females (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus[SLE], female-to-male ratio 9:1), whereas in contrast, infectious diseases affect more men than women.  Our preliminary results suggest that interferon(IFN)-mediated immune responses, key events in host defense and inflammation, exhibit sexual dimorphisms in human keratinocytes in a sex-hormone independent manner. Consistently, the female human skin is biased towards increased expression of genes associated with autoimmune disease susceptibility. These genes are independent of sex-hormone regulation, and are regulated by VGLL3, a female-increased, putative transcription factor. VGLL3 promotes the expression of immune genes, including interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), in a manner that is significantly associated with transcriptomic alterations present in multiple female-biased autoimmune diseases including lupus.  This project aims to identify the molecular basis of sex dimorphisms in IFN responses by testing the hypothesis that higher levels of VGLL3 in females enable priming of ISGs towards sensitized interferon responses and/or delayed recovery from stimulation. To address this we propose the following specific aims:  · Aim 1. Determine sex disparities in transcriptional responses to IFNs and their regulation by VGLL3  · Aim 2. Establish the chromatin mechanism for sex-dependent ISG profiles  · Aim 3. Determine the in vivo role of VGLL3 in regulating IFN-mediated immune processes  With the successful completion of this work, we will have made major advances towards understanding of the molecular basis for sex-dependent immunological processes. This work may also become the basis for novel, sex-specific therapeutic measures for infectious and autoimmune diseases. RELEVANCE By delineating the role of VGLL3 in shaping the sexually dimorphic interferon response, this study is designed to understand the molecular basis of a fundamental difference between men and women in immune regulation. Clinically, it may provide a target and pathway for the prevention and treatment of diseases with aberrant interferon signatures, which will be especially significant for the management of autoimmune diseases, as currently there are no cures or effective preventative measures. It may also shed light on the personalized treatment of immunological diseases in order to address the sex-specific effects of drugs.",The Role of VGLL3 in Sexually Dimorphic Interferon-Driven

"Biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying internalizing psychopathology in a prospective, population-based cohort of sexual minority young adults PROJECT SUMMARY Sexual minority (SM) individuals (e.g., those who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual) are substantially more likely than heterosexuals to experience internalizing psychopathology and associated comorbidity. Young and early adulthood (ages 18 to 34) represents the period during which significant sexual orientation disparities in internalizing psychopathology emerge. Yet, little is known about the biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying the sexual orientation disparity in mental disorders during this critical developmental stage. We have created a rare opportunity, currently unavailable in US-based studies, to address these knowledge gaps by capitalizing on three methodological advancements available in a large prospective, population-based dataset in Sweden: the Swedish National Public Health Survey (SNPHS). These advancements include the opportunity to: (1) follow back SM survey respondents sampled using probability designs; (2) match those SM respondents to a heterosexual comparison using registry data that contains objective records of sociodemographic and mental health characteristics shown to robustly predict internalizing psychopathology; and (3) link longitudinal biomarker data to mental health assessments. Capitalizing on these strengths, our research will address three aims. First, we will evaluate whether psychosocial mechanisms (e.g., negative self-schemas, attentional threat bias, social avoidance) explain the young adult SM disparity in internalizing psychopathology. We address this aim by following a new representative cohort of SM young adults ages 18-34 (N=673) and a matched heterosexual cohort (N=673) drawn from the SNPHS, which we will call the PLUS (Pathways to Longitudinally Understanding Stress) cohort. We will administer to this cohort an online battery of self-report and behavioral measures of internalizing psychopathology and proposed mechanisms for four years annually. Second, we will evaluate whether biological mechanisms explain the young adult SM disparity in internalizing psychopathology. To address this aim, we will collect biomarkers from the PLUS sample, which will be self-collected via the dried blood spot method. These biological measures will capture stress-sensitive inflammatory processes (C- reactive protein, IL-6, TNF) implicated in internalizing psychopathology. Third, we will examine whether stigma-related reactions (e.g., identity concealment) and the biopsychosocial mechanisms identified in Aims 1 and 2 mediate the prospective association between stigma-related stress and internalizing psychopathology among SM young adults in the new PLUS cohort. Secondary analyses for all aims will examine the generalizability of our model to externalizing comorbidities and to intersectional populations of SM. Existing research, and our own pilot data, indicates that the results will generalize to understanding mechanisms underlying internalizing psychopathology among SM in the US and abroad. This theoretically informed, methodologically rigorous investigation permits the most comprehensive test of young adult SM mental health to date, allowing us to identify modifiable treatment targets to advance SM mental health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sexual minority (SM) populations face among the highest odds of depression, anxiety, and suicide of any group; however, little is known about the biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying internalizing psychopathology across SM development, which represents a critical gap in knowledge. This study offers the most comprehensive and methodologically rigorous investigation of internalizing psychopathology among young adult SM populations to date, permitting unprecedented tests of the mechanisms underlying mental disorders among this vulnerable population of young adults. This research promises to uncover new information regarding modifiable treatment targets to advance the health of SM populations both domestically and globally.","Biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying internalizing psychopathology in a prospective, population-based cohort of sexual minority young adults",9883046,R01MH118245,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Sources ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BSF2 ', ' HPGF ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IL-6 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Probability ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Sweden ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Biological ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Link ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Sample Size ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Respondent ', ' Spottings ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Investigation ', ' Reaction ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' cohort ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' (TNF)-α ', ' Cachectin ', ' Macrophage-Derived TNF ', ' Monocyte-Derived TNF ', ' TNF ', ' TNF A ', ' TNF Alpha ', ' TNF-α ', ' TNFA ', ' TNFα ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha ', ' TNF gene ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' comparator group ', ' comparison group ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' population based ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' data registry ', ' sexual minority ', ' Same-sex ', ' secondary analysis ', ' health assessment ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' ']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,737642,-0.0044992287185960005
"Parenting and Men's Health: The Utility of the Fathers and Sons Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the public health significance of problems such as substance abuse and depression among African American men, few evidence-based prevention strategies have been developed for these men and even fewer have focused on a strategy that uses their role as a father as a protection against poor health outcomes. This application proposes to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the Fathers and Sons Program for reducing depression and drinking behavior and increasing substance use and mental health service utilization among nonresident African American fathers. It focuses on enhancing fathers' parenting knowledge, attitudes and behaviors, connectedness with their sons, and awareness and use of community resources. This theoretically-based, gender-specific, culturally relevant, family-centered program was originally designed to enhance parenting attitudes and behaviors among nonresident African American fathers and strengthen their relationship with their preadolescent sons as a way to prevent youth risky behaviors. It was developed using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to increase its relevance and appeal to the intended audiences. Preliminary evidence suggests the program is promising for improving health behaviors and well-being among fathers as well. Our goal is to conduct a randomized control trial to evaluate the program for its long-term health benefits for both fathers and sons. The results of the original Fathers and Sons intervention program will be compared to a control group that will receive a family-based program focused on physical activity and nutrition. Because fathers and sons participate in the Fathers and Sons programs together, we will have the added benefit of examining how influencing father's parenting attitudes and behaviors affect their sons' health behaviors, offering intergenerational perspectives on men's health.

"Advance Care Planning (ACP) among Sexual and Gender Minority Individuals and Their Caregivers Sexual and gender minority individuals (SGM) face discrimination, stigma, and health disparities. Advance Care Planning (ACP) aims to ensure people receive medical care that is consistent with their goals, preferences, and values as they become seriously ill. Our work in the parent R01 is to study the trends, barriers, and facilitators to the uptake of ACP and its impact on care. However, there exists scant research on ACP in the SGM community. This mixed- methods supplemental proposal will build on our existing research to better understand ACP among SGM adults and their caregivers. Aim 1: To understand factors associated with Advance Care Planning (ACP) discussions among transgender or gender non-binary Medicare beneficiaries using claims data.  Using Fee-for-Service Medicare claims, we will utilize a previously validated diagnosis code algorithm designed to identify transgender or gender non-binary beneficiaries to measure the rate of billed ACP visits. We will examine uptake and use of this code during the years 2016- 2018, compared with other high needs populations. Aim 2: To understand the needs, lived experiences, and challenges facing self-identified sexual and gender minority (SGM) adults around ACP.  Using a national polling survey, we will compare SGM adults with other respondents on a limited number of ACP issues, including experience appointing healthcare proxies, and completion of Advance Directives (ADs). A subset of SGM respondents will be re-contacted for follow-up semi-structured interviews for a more in-depth qualitative exploration of advance care planning with clinical providers and the role of family/partners/caregivers, legal next of kin status, and perceptions of bias and/or discrimination.  Identifying patterns around ACP rates and engagement among SGM adults will help inform person-centered interventions to facilitate high quality ACP discussions among vulnerable or underserved populations. This project will address a critical evidence gap in conducting research to advance the science of caring for aging SGM adults. Project Narrative: Understanding advance care planning (ACP) discussions between providers and individuals who are sexual and gender minorities (SGM) will help inform person-centered interventions to facilitate high quality ACP discussions among this population. Our proposed research study will inform policy and practice by 1) understanding factors associated with ACP discussions among transgender or gender non- binary Medicare beneficiaries using claims data, and 2) understanding the needs, experiences, and challenges facing self-identified sexual and gender minority (SGM) adults and caregivers around ACP.",Advance Care Planning (ACP) among Sexual and Gender Minority Individuals and Their Caregivers,10093464,R01NR017034,"['Academy ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Advance Directives ', ' advanced directive ', ' Aging ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Family dynamics ', ' family structure/dynamics ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Fees for Service ', ' Fee-for-Service Plans ', ' uptake ', ' Respondent ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Visit ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Advance Healthcare Planning ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' trend ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' beneficiary ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' person centered ', ' Medicare claim ', ' health equity ', ' Algorithmic Design ', ' Algorithmic Engineering ', ' algorithm engineering ', ' algorithmic composition ', ' Algorithm Design ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' ']",NINR,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,99460,0.03301555392268744
"Intervening to improve HIV treatment and reduce drinking in young, black men who have sex with men Significance. In the US, young, black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) are disparately impacted by HIV. For many YBMSM, heavy drinking or problems related to alcohol use adversely impacts their HIV care and treatment. Thus, interventions to improve HIV treatment outcomes and reduce heavy drinking in HIV-infected YBMSM in HIV treatment are urgently needed. Career Development Plan. Dr. Knox's training will include developing critical skills in intervention research and implementation science, and substantive training in HIV care and treatment. This will be achieved through a plan that includes seminars, workshops, coursework, conferences, and tailored mentoring. These activities will help Dr. Knox become an independent investigator with a research program focused on understanding and addressing HIV and alcohol use in vulnerable populations. Research Plan. In Aim 1, Dr. Knox's proposed research involves conducting formative work to inform the development of an intervention that addresses HIV treatment and alcohol use in heavy-drinking, HIV- infected, YBMSM. The intervention will borrow components from two distinct and potentially complementary, evidence-based clinic-based interventions that are brief and theory-driven. The first improves HIV treatment outcomes in HIV-infected YBMSM by involving a member of their social network to support them in HIV care. The second intervention addresses alcohol use by using smartphone technology to engage participants daily in self-monitoring relative to drinking reduction goals formed during a brief, motivational component of the baseline intervention session. In Aim 2, the information from this formative work will be synthesized with the help of consultant workgroups made up of YBMSM and implementation partners. The product of Aims 1 and 2 will be an innovative intervention that leverages both social network support and technology to improve HIV treatment outcomes and reduce alcohol use in heavy-drinking, HIV-infected YBMSM. It will be administered as a single- session baseline intervention with brief follow-up check-ins. In Aim 3, the new intervention will be pilot tested to assess its potential efficacy, acceptability, feasibility and implementation against a randomly assigned control condition among 60 heavy-drinking, HIV-infected YBMSM in an HIV clinic in New York City (NYC). As an epicenter of the HIV epidemic, interventions for young, black MSM in HIV treatment are urgently needed in NYC. The results of this pilot test will inform the development of an R01 proposal for a fully powered randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and implementation of the developed intervention. Mentorship. A team of expert investigators in alcohol and drug use, HIV, racial and sexual minorities, intervention development, implementation science and mixed methods will support this research. Public Health Impact. The project aims to reduce disparities in HIV treatment outcomes and, in turn, incidence of new HIV infections, a high research priority of the NIH Office of AIDS Research. Developing HIV interventions targeted for critical, underserved populations also works towards achieving important End the HIV Epidemic milestones. Young, black men who have sex with men in the US are disparately impacted by HIV, and there is an urgent need for interventions that support these men in HIV treatment, especially those who drink heavily. The proposed project will develop an intervention that leverages social network support and electronic mobile technology to reduce alcohol use and improve HIV treatment outcomes that will then be evaluated against a randomized control condition in a pilot trial among 60 young, black men who have sex with men in an HIV clinic in New York City. The project aims to reduce disparities in HIV treatment outcomes and, in turn, incidence of new HIV infections, a high research priority of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, and an important step towards achieving End the HIV Epidemic milestones.","Intervening to improve HIV treatment and reduce drinking in young, black men who have sex with men",10081990,K01AA028199,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Power-Up: An Effectiveness Trial of the Diabetes Prevention Program Tailored for Black and Latino Men Abstract A clinic-based translation of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) tailored to Black and Latino men has the potential to address prior limitations of DPP implementation and reduce diabetes disparities among men. The proposed study is designed to 1) Assess the effect of Power-Up vs. standard care National DPP (NDPP) on percent weight loss among racial/ethnic minority men at risk for diabetes; 2) Compare engagement of racial/ethnic minority men at risk for diabetes in Power-Up vs. standard care NDPP; and 3) Evaluate the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Costs of Power-Up using the RE-AIM framework. We hypothesize that men randomized to Power-Up will achieve significantly greater weight loss (% weight loss from baseline) at 16-weeks and 1-year than men randomized to the standard care, mixed-gender NDPP group. Men randomized to Power-Up will also have significantly greater engagement rates (i.e., attend at least 4 sessions) and retention rates (i.e., attend 9 or more sessions) than men randomized to the standard care NDPP. Using the electronic health record (EHR) systems of a large academic medical center and a network of small to medium independent primary care practices throughout New York City, we will identify Black and Latino men that meet the BMI and A1c eligibility requirements for NDPP. We expect to enroll 450 participants through our health system partners. Men will be randomized 1:1 to either the Power-Up intervention arm or referred to the standard NDPP at their clinic site. Consistent with current CDC standards and current NDPP practices of our health system partners, telephone make-up sessions will be offered by coaches in both conditions to men who miss in-person sessions. The primary outcome will be percent weight loss over 12 months, measured at baseline, approximately 16 weeks (end of core sessions), and 12 months (end of maintenance sessions). Study-collected weight will be the primary outcome measured at the first Power-Up or NDPP session by coaches (or from study staff or clinic sites when sessions are not attended). With a sample size of 450 men, a standard deviation of 4.7 percentage points in percent weight loss, and an intraclass (intra program group) correlation of 0.05 we would have 98.2% power to detect a 2.5 percentage point difference between the intervention arms at the 0.05 significance level. This sample size would also give us 80% power to detect a 13.8 percentage point difference in engagement, and a 16.4 percentage point difference in retention. Tertiary outcomes related to the RE-AIM evaluation include quantitative and qualitative data collected via validated self- report questionnaires administered via telephone survey, EHR-data extraction, and qualitative interviewing of individuals and focus groups. Our evaluation will answer questions most important to healthcare systems and NDPP providers and our partnerships with diverse healthcare systems will allow us to disseminate the intervention broadly, if proven effective. Narrative Men of color are particularly underrepresented in Diabetes Prevention Programs (DPP). The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of an adaptation of the DPP tailored to the needs and preferences of racial and ethnic minority men. The results of this study will help to fill an important gap in health promotion and diabetes prevention for men.",Power-Up: An Effectiveness Trial of the Diabetes Prevention Program Tailored for Black and Latino Men,10020897,R01DK121896,"['Academic Medical Centers ', ' University Medical Centers ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Epidemic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Interview ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' New York City ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Prediabetes ', ' Prediabetic State ', ' pre-diabetes ', ' pre-diabetic ', ' prediabetic ', ' Prediabetes syndrome ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' outreach ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' diabetes risk ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' primary care setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' retention strategy ', ' student retention ', ' retention rate ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' personalized approach ', ' racial minority ', ' gender disparity ', ' recruit ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' program costs ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NIDDK,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,635845,0.05075073455782634

"A novel sugar-sweetened beverage reduction intervention for Native American men Project Summary  In the United States, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) is the largest single food source of calories. The intake of SSB is disproportionately high among Native Americans (NA). There are strong and consistent data documenting relationships among high SSB consumption and numerous health issues (e.g. obesity, diabetes, cancers, heart disease); NA bear a disproportionate burden of all of these health issues, particularly NA men.  NA health must be considered within a broader historical context of colonialism that has contributed to the existing social determinants of health landscape in which NAs live. Incorporating this historical context is critical to meaningfully address health inequities within NA populations. Yet few studies have integrated NA values with social determinants of health, historical context, and dietary change using a tribally-guided, culturally-appropriate approach.  We will target the major dietary risk factor of SSB, in addition to noticeable gaps in understanding the role of colonialism in NA health behavior inequities. Developed and tested by this research team, SIPsmartER is an SSB intervention that reduced SSB intake by 227kcal (-326,-127) per day in a rural, predominately White and female population from baseline to 6 months. We propose to adapt and integrate SIPsmartER within the traditional NA activity of lacrosse through a theoretical framework that connects NA historical context with health inequities to create SIPsmartER Lacrosse. Among NA, lacrosse is an ancestral activity associated with well-being. Our tribal leaders have asked for a dietary intervention that would target multiple health conditions while acknowledging social determinants of health. These leaders suggested building on the game of lacrosse, as this activity engages NA men regularly.  We will adapt SIPsmartER into SIPsmartER Lacrosse. We will develop a theoretical framework that links the historical consequences of colonialism with current inequities in NA health outcomes, including SSB intake. We will then use a cluster RCT that targets 60 men nested within six lacrosse teams from two rural reservations/territories from the Seneca Nation of Indians. The overall goal is to the examine the preliminary efficacy of SIPsmartER Lacrosse in a 2 group (SIPsmartER Lacrosse vs. alternative treatment control) by 3 assessment (Baseline, 6-month, 18-month) design. Specific Aim 1: Create an evidence-based culturally appropriate SSB intervention for NA men that integrates their unique historical context in adapting SIPsmartER to SIPsmartER Lacrosse. Specific Aim 2: Implement and determine the initial efficacy of SIPsmartER Lacrosse to reduce SSB consumption. Project Narrative Native American (NA) men have high sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake, which is related to a lot of health issues, like obesity, diabetes, some cancers, and heart disease.

"Health Education and Reproductive Health Project Summary. Compared to heterosexual women, sexual minority women (e.g., lesbian and bisexual women) face heightened risk for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) disparities. Though this seems counterintuitive, many sexual minority women have sexual histories with men which place them at risk for outcomes like teenage pregnancy. Research has shown that sexual minority women are also less likely to use contraceptive methods including barrier-based protection that can prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and they have higher rates of STI contraction than heterosexual women. To date, the health communication mechanisms that contribute to these disparities are not well understood. Wider literature on general female populations points to sexual health information, patient-provider communication, and maternal communication as important predictors of SRH in adolescent and adult female samples. However, exploratory descriptive work on the health information and communication experiences of sexual minority women point to themes of difficulty accessing appropriate information, negative or uninformative encounters with providers, and hesitation from mothers about discussing SRH with sexual minority girls. Thus, the goal of this project is to examine how sexual health information, patient-provider communication, and maternal SRH communication differ by sexual orientation and mediate SRH disparities in a sample of women from across the United States. These data, which are derived from three ongoing cohort studies of adolescent health, provide a unique opportunity to examine detailed measures of sexual orientation, health communication, and SRH histories of a large population-based sample of U.S. women. These research goals will be facilitated by the applicant’s training plan, which involves advancement in skillsets of biostatistics, epidemiology, and health communication research methods. Combined with a collaboration team of experts in the disciplines of social epidemiology, sexual minority health, biostatistics, and health communication, all of whom are hosted within the Boston Children’s Hospital network, this fellowship will provide an exceptional training environment and mentorship experience in these subject areas and contribute greatly to the success of this research plan. Findings from this project will be innovative in their ability to address communication facilitators and barriers of SRH in sexual minority women, a population that has been understudied in the wider SRH and health communication literature base. Findings will also be significant in their translation to both the sexual health information and communication practices of medical providers and other sources of health information (like maternal SRH communication). Ultimately, this NRSA addresses an important and vulnerable health area for sexual minority women, a group recently recognized by the NIH as a health disparity population. Project Narrative. Sexual minority women are more likely than heterosexual women to experience negative sexual and reproductive (SRH) outcomes. The goal of this project is to examine how sexual orientation differences in SRH information and communication mediate SRH disparities in a large, longitudinal sample of U.S. women.",Health Education and Reproductive Health,9986364,F32HD100081,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Boston ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communication ', ' Contraceptive Usage ', ' contraceptive use ', ' Daughter ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fellowship ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Literature ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentorship ', ' Mothers ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pregnancy in Adolescence ', ' Adolescent Pregnancy ', ' Pregnancy in Minors ', ' Teen Pregnancy ', ' Teenage Pregnancy ', ' Underage Pregnancy ', ' adolescents who are pregnant ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Sexual Abstinence ', ' Celibacy ', ' abstain from intercourse ', ' abstain from sexual activity ', ' abstain from sexual intercourse ', ' abstaining from sex ', ' celibate ', ' not sexually active ', ' sex abstinence ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Pap smear ', ' Pap Test ', ' Pap screening ', ' Papanicolaou Smear ', ' Papanicolaou Test ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Lesbian ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Collaborations ', ' Health Psychology ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' peer ', ' cultural competence ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Reporting ', ' Contraception ', ' Fertility Control ', ' Inhibition of Fertilization ', ' Contraceptive methods ', ' HIV risk ', ' reproductive ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' communication theory ', ' girls ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' outreach to information ', ' Access to Information ', ' Reproductive Health Services ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' information resource ', ' knowledge resource ', ' knowledge resources ', ' Information Resources ', ' NRSA ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' i(19) ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', "" Nurses' Health Study "", ' sex ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' minority health ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' population based ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' social health determinants ', ' sexual minority ', ' same sex partner ', ' same sex relationship ', ' same-sex couple ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' adolescent health ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' recruit ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' STD prevention ', ' prevent sexually transmitted disease ', ' prevent sexually transmitted infections ', ' sexually transmitted disease prevention ', ' sexually transmitted infection prevention ', ' STI prevention ', ' social epidemiology ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' ']",NICHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,F32,2020,69810,0.05045070626139878
"Engaging Black Men in Digital Health to Improve Self-Management of Type 2 Diabetes: An Iterative Participatory Design Approach ABSTRACT Helping patients self-manage a complex chronic illness such as Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) remains a challenge particularly for racial minorities especially for Black men, who experience higher rates of incidence and poorer health outcomes. Diabetes requires stringent self-management and monitoring of blood glucose levels, weight, medication adherence and lifestyle behaviors such as diet and exercise. Yet, Black men face more barriers to diabetes self-management than non-Hispanic whites for a variety of reasons, including disparities in access and delivery of care, communication and health literacy barriers, gender roles and, mistrust and cultural beliefs regarding the medical system. Due to the ubiquity of smartphones and healthcare dashboards, digital technologies can be leveraged across diverse populations to collect and monitor diabetes-related data from patients in their daily environments (i.e., blood glucose, weight, medication adherence, and lifestyle behaviors). These data can be analyzed and in near real-time to provide guidance to patients to self-manage and give clinicians a more complete picture of health in-between clinic visits. However, research on digital health that facilitates self-management among Black men with T2DM is scarce, particularly as it relates to how to appropriately engage Black men with T2DM in use of digital health technologies to improve self-management. While digital health holds great promise, we do not yet know how to develop technologies that are relevant and tailored for Black men who need to self-manage their diabetes. Congruent with the strategic plan of the National Institute of Nursing Research, which seeks to promote innovations using technology to improve health and improve quality of life for individuals with chronic illness through self-management, this study aims to fill a knowledge gap concerning Black men and how to effectively tailor digital health technologies to facilitate T2DM management. The purpose of this study is to investigate the barriers, facilitators, and preferences of using digital health technologies for T2DM self-management among Black men. This qualitative study will employ focus groups to explore the perspectives of 40 Black men living with T2DM in North Carolina. Further, we will employ an iterative participatory design approach to develop and refine a healthcare dashboard that addresses specific racial/ethnic and gender-based needs and preferences. This knowledge is essential for meeting the self-management needs of the growing population of Black men with diabetes. The long-term goal of this study is to inform future research that will develop and test digital health technologies to improve self-management that align with the racial/ethnic needs and gender-based preferences of Black men living with T2DM. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study seeks to improve our understanding of the barriers, facilitators, and preferences that contribute to the use of digital health technologies for T2DM self-management among Black men. The results from this study will provide foundational knowledge for the development of culturally-sensitive and gender-appropriate digital health technologies for self-management among Black men living with Type 2 Diabetes.",Engaging Black Men in Digital Health to Improve Self-Management of Type 2 Diabetes: An Iterative Participatory Design Approach,9992295,F31NR019213,"['Amputation ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Communication ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Incidence ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Literature ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' North Carolina ', ' Patients ', ' Peripheral Nervous System Diseases ', ' PNS Diseases ', ' Peripheral Nerve Diseases ', ' Peripheral Nervous System Disorders ', ' Peripheral Neuropathy ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Sample Size ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' health literacy ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' diet and exercise ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' diabetic management ', ' diabetes management ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' health data ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' dashboard ', ' recruit ', ' data streams ', ' diabetes self-care ', ' diabetes self-management ', ' ']",NINR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,37319,0.05227207282942187
"Intimate Partner Violence in Sexual Minority Female Adolescents and Young Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Young female sexual minorities (YFSM) are at exceptionally high risk for intimate partner violence (IPV), with over half of YFSM reporting physical or sexual abuse by a dating partner. These young IPV victims may be particularly vulnerable to the negative physical and mental health consequences of IPV, including substance abuse, depression, and suicide, due to minority stress and diminished protective resources (e.g., parent support, community connectedness). In addition, YFSM may be less likely to report and to seek or receive help for IPV because they are not ""out"" about their sexual orientation or they fear stigmatization and discrimination. Women who seek help for same-sex IPV are often denied services (e.g., two-thirds of LGBT IPV survivors were denied access to domestic violence shelters) and feel marginalized and unsupported by domestic violence service systems. Basic research is clearly needed to inform development of culturally sensitive, evidence-based interventions to prevent IPV in YFSM and to support female sexual minority IPV victims. The existing literature, however, has almost exclusively focused on IPV in heterosexuals. Because LGBT teens and young adults face unique issues surrounding their relationships and sexual behaviors (e.g., pressures to deny or conceal sexual identity and activities), the risk and protective factors for IPV, help-seeking behaviors, and consequences of IPV in sexual minority youth are likely quite different from those observed in heterosexual youth. The overarching goal of this project is to begin to address these disparities by conducting an innovative study of IPV in female sexual minority adolescents and young adults (YFSM). We propose a novel, minority stress-informed dynamic developmental systems perspective of IPV in YFSM, which we will test using a mixed-methods, accelerated longitudinal design. Building upon the longest running study of LGBT youth, we will collect quantitative data from two ethnically diverse cohorts of YFSM (N= 530; ages 16-26) every six months for two years, as well as qualitative data from 50 selected participants. We will accomplish the overarching goal with four primary specific aims: (1) Describe the nature and trajectories of IPV in YFSM across adolescence and young adulthood; (2) Identify risk and protective factors for IPV among YFSM, including factors that differentiate violent vs. non-violent/healthy relationships; (3) Examine factors that affect YFSM's reporting of IPV, help-seeking for IPV, and ability to benefit from help provided (e.g., cultural competence of providers); and (4) Evaluate the consequences of IPV in YFSM, identifying factors that raise risk for or protect YFSM victims from revictimization and negative health consequences of IPV. Integration of the resulting quantitative and qualitative data will be used to inform the development of evidence-based interventions to prevent IPV among YFSM and better serve those who experience IPV. 1 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Young female sexual minorities experience exceptionally high rates of Intimate partner violence (IPV) and may be particularly vulnerable to subsequent physical and mental health problems. The aims of this study are to describe IPV in female sexual minorities across adolescence and young adulthood, as well as to identify factors that raise risk for or protect against IPV, affect IPV victims' ability to receive appropriate help, and exacerbate or mitigate the negative health consequences of IPV. Data obtained from this project will inform the development of culturally sensitive interventions to reduce the rates of IPV and to better support IPV victims in this vulnerable population.",Intimate Partner Violence in Sexual Minority Female Adolescents and Young Adults,9917804,R01HD086170,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Buffers ', ' Communities ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' pressure ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Running ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Woman ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' shelter ', ' shelter-housing ', ' Shelter facility ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Domestic Violence ', ' Survivors ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' sex abuse ', ' sexually abused ', ' Sexual abuse ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicide ideation ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' cultural competence ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' Reporting ', ' Psychological abuse ', ' mental abuse ', ' emotional abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Teen ', ' teen years ', ' teenage ', ' Teenagers ', ' sex ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' physical abuse ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Coupled ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' 21 years of age ', ' age 21 ', ' age 21 years ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' twenty-one years of age ', ' 21 year old ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' revictimization ', ' longitudinal design ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' same sex partner ', ' same sex relationship ', ' same-sex couple ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Same-sex ', ' marginalization ', ' social exclusion ', ' violence victimization ', ' violence perpetration ', ' prospective test ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' recruit ', ' service providers ', ' protective factors ', ' sexual identity ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,R01,2020,557493,0.01631227568850796
"Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center Project Summary  This application is for the renewal of the Study to Help the AIDS Research Effort (SHARE), which has been the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) since 1984. The MACS was established with sites in Baltimore-Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles, initially to study the natural history of HIV infection in men who have sex with men and later, with the advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the treated history of HIV infection, including the relationship between long-term controlled HIV infection and chronic diseases and co-morbidities associated with aging. To reflect these changing priorities in HIV research, SHARE has had subsequent enrollments to balance proportions of HIV- and HIV+ men and to reflect the HIV epidemic more accurately. Men enrolled have been followed semi annually since 1984 or enrollment and have a) provided questionnaire data, physical exam data, laboratory data (including HIV serostatus, T cell subset measurements, and HIV viral load measurements), and a large repository of plasma, serum, cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other specimens; and these have permitted SHARE and MACS to make major contributions to the understanding of treated and untreated HIV disease, and comorbidities associated with increased survival due to antiretroviral treatment.  The present application, in response to RFA-HL-19-008, aims to extend followup of the SHARE cohort (about 640 men) from 2019 to 2026, to allow merger of SHARE (and the other MACS sites) with the nine sites of the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) into a single cohort, termed the MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS), that will include both men and women. The specific aims of the CCS are outlined in a parallel application from the putative Data and Coordinating Center (DACC) of the CCS, and the 10 Specific Aims of that single cohort are outlined in the DACC application for the CCS; these include Cardiovascular (CV), Pulmonary/Sleep (PS), Neurocognitive NC), Aging (AG), Cancer, HIV Pathogenesis (PA), Psychosocial (PS), Health Disparities, Platform (PL), and Career Development (CD) Aims. The specific aims of the SHARE Clinical Research Site (CRS) are to: 1) play a leading role in the achievement 7 of these Aims by the CCS (i.e., CV, PS, AG, PA, PS, PL, and CD), including serving as a reading center for echocardiography and sleep studies; 2) to contribute to the achievement of the other 3 CCS aims, and 3) to implement all applicable CCS protocols and support the scientific goals of the CCS. Local initiatives on inflammation and physical activity will also support these aims, which take full advantage of the extensive follow-up and repository of biological specimens already available from this cohort and which will be extended under this proposal, enabling further contributions to our understanding and care of comorbidities and other health issues faced by people living with HIV today. Narrative This application is for renewal for 7 years of the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a longstanding study of the natural and treated histories of HIV infection men who have sex with men in four US cites (Baltimore-Washington, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Chicago) which has made many important contributions to the treatment and understanding of HIV infection since 1984. For the next 7 years, we propose to integrate our site with the 9 WIHS sites into a new MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS) which will follow men already enrolled in Baltimore and Washington, DC, and also recruit a few new men replacing those who have been lost to the study, in order to better understand the long-term consequences of living with HIV, including possible effects on chronic diseases and aging, and to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of these consequences.",Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center,10145892,U01HL146201,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Chicago ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cryopreservation ', ' Cryofixation ', ' cold preservation ', ' cold storage ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' District of Columbia ', ' D.C.

"Simulation Modeling to Understand and Address HIV Disparities in Racial, Ethnic, and Sexual Minority Populations Project Summary Racial, ethnic, and sexual minority populations are disproportionately impacted by infectious disease, particularly HIV. Individuals at the intersection of multiple of these marginalized identities are even more likely to be impacted by HIV – especially Black and Hispanic men who have sex with men. While there is growing evidence that the day-to-day life of racial and sexual minorities differs from majority populations, there is a limited understanding of how differences in neighborhoods, differences in places where time is spent, and differences in the kinds of people connected with may impact disease spread and fuel disparities. Moreover, there is even less comprehensive understanding of how public health strategies could be refined to specifically reduce health disparities. Simulation models that accurately replicate population dynamics by simulating the movement and interaction of millions of individuals allow researchers a toolbox to understand the underlying dynamics of disease transmission and identify potential targets for intervention. This project joins two complementary teams of researchers in Chicago to build chiSTIG, a simulation model specifically derived to understand the social contextual dynamics which lead to disparities in HIV. The first team, at Northwestern University, have been funded by the NIH to capture rich data on the social systems and physical spaces inhabited by racial and sexual minorities, and have utilized these data to understand how the social and sexual isolation of young Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) in Chicago drives disparities in HIV. The second team, at the University of Chicago/Argonne National Laboratory, have built chiSIM, an extraordinarily powerful agent-based modeling (ABM) framework that simulates the interaction of 2.9 million Chicagoans across 1.2 million geo-located places to understand disease outbreaks and guide intervention development. chiSIM is a flexible system that has been used to understand prevention strategies for a number of infectious diseases. We propose to utilize several existing rich empirical datasets to build a chiSIM-derived model, chiSTIG, so that it might serve as a counterfactual laboratory able to test competing hypotheses regarding the etiology of infectious disease inequities in HIV for sexual minorities, specifically Black and Hispanic MSM, and potential routes for intervention. Specifically, the framework will be extended through the integration of detailed data on the physical and online third places utilized by and the social and sexual interactions of racially diverse MSM in Chicago. Project Narrative Simulation models that accurately replicate population dynamics can provide vital information for the prevention and control of infectious disease, allowing researchers to understand potential patterns of transmission and identify effective targets for intervention. However, such simulations are often optimized for the ‘average’ individual and fail to incorporate information specific to racial/ethnic and sexual minority populations that are disproportionately affected by infectious disease. Building upon an existing spatially- embedded simulation framework, this project will develop a novel agent-based model that integrates rich empirical data on racially diverse MSM to serve as a counterfactual laboratory to test hypotheses regarding the etiology of HIV disparities and potential routes for intervention.","Simulation Modeling to Understand and Address HIV Disparities in Racial, Ethnic, and Sexual Minority Populations",10011153,R01MD014703,"['Affect ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Geography ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Household ', ' Infection ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Population Dynamics ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' sociologist ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Site ', ' Work Location ', ' Work Place ', ' Work-Site ', ' Worksite ', ' work setting ', ' Workplace ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Phase ', ' racism ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' infectious disease transmission ', ' disease transmission ', ' Funding ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' preference ', ' Church ', ' Structure ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' MRSA ', ' Methicillin Resistant S Aureus ', ' Methicillin Resistant S.

"Sexual Orientation/Gender Identity, Socioeconomic Status, and Health across the Life Course ABSTRACT This competing revision would support expansion of the sample inclusion criteria of the Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, Socioeconomic Status, and Health Across the Life Course Study (SOGI-SES; 1R01HD087365-01A1). The SOGI-SES study is developing and administering a web survey to an estimated subset of 2444 sexual and gender minority respondents, as well as 1500 cisgender heterosexuals, in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) Wave V Program Project sample. To date, Add Health has completed one in-school, four in-home, and one web-based waves of interviews with a nationally representative sample of approximately 20,000 US adolescents who, at study entry in 1994-95, were in grades 7-12.The overall goal of the SOGI-SES project is to capture and disseminate socioeconomic and developmental milestone information pertinent to the health and development of sexual and gender minorities. Despite the importance of SES to health, knowledge about factors that pattern resources and strains across sexual and gender minority groups is incomplete, largely because of the absence of appropriate and high quality data. In the SOGI-SES study, sexual orientation identity and gender identity were to be used to define sexual and gender minorities (SGMs) for sampling purposes (total expected n with 80% response rate = 3155). In this revision we propose to expand the sample inclusion criteria to encompass individuals with nonconforming gender expression and/or with discordant lifetime sexual partnering and sexual orientation identity (i.e., individuals who consistently identify as “completely heterosexual,” but report same-sex partners). Based on Wave V data we estimate 722 unique individuals in these two groups. Assuming an 80% response rate, with this supplement we would add 578 respondents to our originally proposed sample. A growing body of research suggests that nonconforming gender expression is associated with increased risk of violence and harassment, poorer mental health, and employment-related inequities. Literature has also indicated that gender nonconformity, a visible stigma, may be even more relevant for psychological health than same-sex sexual orientation. Discordant heterosexual identity and same-sex behavior has also been associated with poorer mental health, possibly due to the stress of concealment. Expanding our sample to include these important and understudied groups will substantially enhance the SOGI-SES project by providing unique information about minorities who have been followed for more than 20 years, from adolescence into adulthood, and who were not originally selected into Add Health based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. The project will test hypotheses derived from Minority Stress Theory to understand the implications of developmental and socioeconomic factors for mental health. Expanded sampling criteria will enable us to enhance the field by providing new information about the intersections of gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, and same-sex partnering and their contributions to socioeconomic status and health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the importance of socioeconomic status to health, and documented health inequalities that disfavor sexual and gender minorities, knowledge about factors that drive these patterns is lacking. This cost-effective competing revision will enhance the Sexual Orientation/Gender Identity, Socioeconomic Status, and Health across the Life Course project utilizing National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health data by over- sampling gender nonconforming individuals and those who identify as heterosexual but report same-sex partners. This enhancement will generate new information and inform public health interventions and public policy about relationships between gender expression and parent-child relationships, employment, wages, and discrimination, as well as Minority Stress among those who report same-sex partners, but do not identify as sexual minorities.","Sexual Orientation/Gender Identity, Socioeconomic Status, and Health across the Life Course",9916300,R01HD087365,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Interview ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' parent child interaction ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Schools ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexuality ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Respondent ', ' fluid ', ' liquid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' health knowledge ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' intergenerational ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' minority health ', ' Intergenerational transfer ', ' Minority ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' population based ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' health inequalities ', ' sexual minority ', ' same sex behavior ', ' same sex partner ', ' same sex relationship ', ' same-sex couple ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' public health intervention ', ' gender non-conforming ', ' non-gender conforming ', ' gender nonconforming ', ' Same-sex ', ' health data ', ' cis-gender ', ' cisgender ', ' data resource ', ' gender expression ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,84038,0.03302264445679987
"Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing PROJECT SUMMARY Sexual minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) are at increased risk for numerous adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, suicidality, substance use, HIV/AIDS, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and certain forms of cancer. Despite clear documentation and replication of these health disparities, relatively little is known about their development from adolescence into adulthood. Two theories primarily dominate the literature. Minority stress models describe unique life stressors experienced only by sexual minorities (e.g., victimization and discrimination based on sexual orientation) as primary contributors to health disparities. Other models implicate both minority stress and normative psychosocial processes together as contributors to health disparities. Some such normative processes include (1) psychological adjustment and characteristics (e.g., emotion regulation/dysregulation, substance use expectancies), (2) disrupted social systems (e.g., family, peers, school), and (3) individual differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, temperament). To date, most studies of both minority stress and normative processes are limited by use of cross-sectional samples of primarily Caucasian adults. Although much has been learned from these studies, they do not permit analysis of emerging health disparities across development. Existing research is therefore limited in terms of both generalizability to diverse populations, and validity of directionality inferences between observed ‘predictors’ and ‘outcomes’. My long-term career goals are to identify mechanisms leading to disparities among sexual minorities, with the goal of improving treatments for these disparities, and to develop screening tools to identify high-risk youth who would benefit from prevention programs. To reach this goal, in this project, I address existing limitations to the literature using a prospective sample of individuals who were 14-19 years old at baseline and followed for over 4 years. My goal is to describe developmental trajectories and mechanisms of health disparity development for sexual minority youth compared with heterosexual youth across a 10-year developmental window spanning ages 14- 23 years. Longitudinal outcomes include depression/anxiety, suicidality, delinquency, sleep, general physical health, disordered eating and substance use. Developmental trajectories for these outcomes will be charted by gender and sexual orientation. Confirmatory analyses based on existing literature will be conducted to examine relations between minority stress and adverse outcomes. Then, I will use machine learning to identify as-yet unknown predictors of adverse outcomes and health disparities and characterize any changes in prediction across time. Finally, I will use state-of-the art intervening variable analyses (mediation, moderation) to evaluate longitudinal mechanisms through which health disparities emerge. Findings should provide insight into mechanisms of disparity development and maintenance, informing prevention and intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sexual minority youth (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) experience wide-ranging disparities in mental and physical health that often persist into adulthood, yet little is known about development of these disparities. This research (1) examines developmental trajectories in mental and physical health outcomes from adolescence to young adulthood among sexual minority and matched heterosexual youth, (2) uses advanced statistical methods (e.g., machine learning) to identify hypothesized and currently unknown factors that predict disparities over time, and (3) elucidates pathways to adversity and resilience. Experiences of sexual minority and heterosexual youth and young adults will be compared to uncover possible differences in developmental experiences that lead to health disparities, with possible implications for prevention and intervention among a highly vulnerable population.",Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing,9929425,F31MD014052,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Building capacity to develop gender-based violence interventions in peri-urban India Project Summary/Abstract Globally, the highest rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) are reported in Southeast Asia. In India, IPV is intensifying in peri-urban areas where over half of the population lives, exacerbated by growing income inequalities and rapid social change. Given that an average of 35% of ever-married women in India have experienced IPV and its many public health sequelae, it is critical to understand the attitudes held by boys, girls, men, and women that may contribute to IPV. The University of Iowa (Department of Community and Behavioral Health) is collaborating with the Saint John’s Medical College (Department of Community Health) in Bangalore to generate evidence about IPV and develop male-focused strategies to reduce IPV in India’s peri- urban settings. The collaboration is addressing the urgent need to work with early adolescent boys their male role models to reshape ideologies about gender roles and masculinity. Focusing on two peri-urban catchment areas in southeast Bangalore district, the two-year, mixed-method project will 1) assess attitudes and behaviors related to gender roles, masculinity, social capital, and violence against women among couples; 2) explore the attitudes of boys, girls, men, and women related to gender norms; and 3) build the institutional capacity of Saint John's Medical College to address violence against women in their research and medical training. The University of Iowa and St. John’s Medical College will use the findings from the two-year project to develop and test an intervention focused on transforming gender norms and reducing violence against women by working with boys and male role models. For Specific Aim 1, we will use qualitative methods to cognitively validate a survey instrument using existing measures for gender roles, masculinity, social capital, and violence against women, including items from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and the Gender Equitable Men (GEM) scale. We will then randomly sample 528 couples (ages 18-49) and administer the new quantitative survey simultaneously and separately to men and women. For Specific Aim 2, we will use qualitative methods to elucidate our findings from the quantitative survey, with a focus on the relationship between gender norms and IPV. We will focus on men and women (ages 18-49), and boys and girls (ages 10-14), by conducting 60 in-depth interviews and 12 focus group discussions to explore gender norms and identify male role models. Joint implementation by the two institutions—building on the University of Iowa’s key strengths in violence prevention, program design and evaluation, and gender roles related to women’s health—will build research and intervention capacity at St. John’s Medical College, while St. John’s contextual expertise will strengthen the University of Iowa’s cultural competency and understanding of violence-related injury in the peri-urban Indian context. Project Narrative Intimate partner violence (IPV) is the most common form of gender-based violence, with very high rates of IPV in Southeast Asia. In India, where an average of 35% of ever-married women have experienced IPV, the public health burden—which includes injury, depression, psychosocial stress, sexually transmitted diseases, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and death—is particularly heavy in the country’s rapidly growing and socioeconomically divided peri-urban areas. Peri-urban communities in India can benefit from studies that contribute to the development of culturally appropriate, male-focused interventions to transform gender norms and reduce violence against women and girls.",Building capacity to develop gender-based violence interventions in peri-urban India,9929054,R21TW010788,"['Male Adolescents ', ' adolescent boy ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Southeastern Asia ', ' Southeast Asia ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Couples ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Ever Married ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' India ', ' Interview ', ' Iowa ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' male ', "" Men's Role "", ' male role ', ' role men ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Poverty ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' pressure ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Proposals ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Social Change ', ' Social modification ', ' Social transformation ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Urban Population ', ' Urbanization ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Woman ', ' Working Women ', ' working females ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' prevent violence ', ' violence prevention ', ' Social Network ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' role model ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Demographic and Health Surveys ', ' Inequality ', ' Saints ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention program ', ' cultural competence ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' social capital ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Catchment Area ', ' Cognitive ', ' Community Trial ', ' Community Health ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' violence against women ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' urban American Indian ', ' urban Indian ', ' urban Native American ', ' Population ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' sexual violence ', ' adolescent man ', ' adolescent men ', ' young man ', ' institutional capacity ', ' gender-based violence ', ' adverse pregnancy outcome ', ' periurban ', ' peri-urban ', ' urban setting ', ' societal expectations ', ' social expectations ', ' social relationships ', ' social cohesion ', ' social structural ', ' socio-structural ', ' sociostructural ', ' social structure ', ' ']",FIC,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2020,133770,0.014766549621637762
"Harnessing the power of peer navigation and mHealth to reduce health disparities in Appalachia Appalachia is a socially and economically disadvantaged part of the US, and growing evidence suggests that health disparities between Appalachia and the rest of the country are widening. Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) and transgender women in rural Appalachia are at increased risk for HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). There remains a dearth of effective approaches to address these emerging and intersecting epidemics among GBMSM and transgender women living in rural settings in the US.  In Aim 1, our community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership proposes to systematically integrate two evidenced-based strategies (i.e., peer navigation and mHealth) into a comprehensive culturally congruent, bilingual intervention to increase the use of needed HIV, STI, and HCV prevention and care services among racially/ethnically diverse GBMSM and transgender women in rural Appalachia. In Aim 2, we will implement and test the intervention through a longitudinal group-randomized design using behavioral assessment and in-depth interview data collected at: (1) baseline, (2) immediate post intervention, and (3) 12- month follow-up. Our hypotheses are that participants in the intervention group, relative to their counterparts in the delayed-intervention group, will demonstrate (1) increased HIV, STI, and HCV testing and (2) increased use of needed prevention services (PrEP and syringe services) and care services (HIV care, STI and HCV treatment, and gender-affirming care). In Aim 3, we will develop and disseminate practice, research, intervention, and policy priorities and recommendations to reduce health disparities in rural Appalachia by conducting an empowerment theory-based community forum.  This CBPR study will advance prevention science and practice through testing an innovative intervention to promote and support the use of needed HIV, STI, and HCV prevention and care services among GBMSM and transgender women; and developing priorities and recommendations to improve their health that will be disseminated to inform public health practice, research, and policy. By integrating peer navigation and mHealth strategies, the proposed study provides a unique opportunity to improve health among vulnerable, hidden, and neglected populations living in rural Appalachia. Findings from this research may inform strategies and approaches to address other health disparities in other rural populations. Narrative Appalachia is a socially and economically disadvantaged part of the US. Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) and transgender women in rural Appalachia are at increased risk for HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and hepatitis C virus (HCV), and yet, little research has been conducted to understand and reduce health disparities among these vulnerable, hidden, and neglected populations in the region.

"Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center Project Summary  This application is for the renewal of the Study to Help the AIDS Research Effort (SHARE), which has been the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) since 1984. The MACS was established with sites in Baltimore-Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles, initially to study the natural history of HIV infection in men who have sex with men and later, with the advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the treated history of HIV infection, including the relationship between long-term controlled HIV infection and chronic diseases and co-morbidities associated with aging. To reflect these changing priorities in HIV research, SHARE has had subsequent enrollments to balance proportions of HIV- and HIV+ men and to reflect the HIV epidemic more accurately. Men enrolled have been followed semi annually since 1984 or enrollment and have a) provided questionnaire data, physical exam data, laboratory data (including HIV serostatus, T cell subset measurements, and HIV viral load measurements), and a large repository of plasma, serum, cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other specimens; and these have permitted SHARE and MACS to make major contributions to the understanding of treated and untreated HIV disease, and comorbidities associated with increased survival due to antiretroviral treatment.  The present application, in response to RFA-HL-19-008, aims to extend followup of the SHARE cohort (about 640 men) from 2019 to 2026, to allow merger of SHARE (and the other MACS sites) with the nine sites of the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) into a single cohort, termed the MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS), that will include both men and women. The specific aims of the CCS are outlined in a parallel application from the putative Data and Coordinating Center (DACC) of the CCS, and the 10 Specific Aims of that single cohort are outlined in the DACC application for the CCS; these include Cardiovascular (CV), Pulmonary/Sleep (PS), Neurocognitive NC), Aging (AG), Cancer, HIV Pathogenesis (PA), Psychosocial (PS), Health Disparities, Platform (PL), and Career Development (CD) Aims. The specific aims of the SHARE Clinical Research Site (CRS) are to: 1) play a leading role in the achievement 7 of these Aims by the CCS (i.e., CV, PS, AG, PA, PS, PL, and CD), including serving as a reading center for echocardiography and sleep studies; 2) to contribute to the achievement of the other 3 CCS aims, and 3) to implement all applicable CCS protocols and support the scientific goals of the CCS.

"MACS/WIHS -CCS ABSTRACT Nearly half the men and women with HIV infection are racial/ethnic minorities living in the South. HIV infection remains a major public health problem despite the availability of treatments. The purpose of this proposal is to advance the knowledge of the consequences of HIV infection, with a focus on HIV-related comorbidities, by participating as a Clinical Research Sites (CRS) of the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS). To meet this goal, Miami will provide expertise to lead important components of the CCS unified science agenda with protocol development and laboratory support to protocols and sub studies, as well as implementing the full CCS unified science agenda. To accomplish this, we will enroll and follow 500 men and women with HIV infection or at risk for HIV. We will enroll approximately 250 men reflective of the HIV epidemic in Miami, and follow men who have sex with men, bisexual men, and heterosexual men including men who are black or Hispanic representing a large minority proportion. As a current Southern WIHS site we will continue to follow the 149 women enrolled in WIHS who have HIV infection or at risk for HIV and are largely minority reflecting the Miami HIV epidemic. With availability of the CCS protocol, we will enroll additional 100 women from the community to reach a goal of approximately 250 women. The men and women enrolled will be consistent with protocol requirements of the MACS/WIHS consortium for new enrollments. Miami will continue its strong leadership, as we provided for the WIHS. Dr. Fischl as lead PI for this multiple PI proposal is the Vice Chair of the WIHS and has had an active role, along with colleagues, in the development of the unified science agenda, including the specific aims, frequency of core protocol visits, and timing of clinical tests, specimen collections, surveys, assessments and clinical tests. The Miami CRS will focus on protocols and sub studies in several innovative areas.1. Explore cardiovascular outcomes and HIV progression in the syndemic of HIV, tobacco, stimulant use, and depression, and investigate inflammatory biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk and immune activation, including sex differences. 2. Explore the effects of the oral, female genital, and gut microbiome on the HIV reservoir and on exposure to antiretroviral therapy. 3. Evaluate comorbidities and effect of HIV persistence, inflammation and immune markers on comorbidity outcomes and plasma markers of inflammation, amyloid pathology and innate immune cell phenotypes on disease outcomes. 4. Examine the trajectories of vulnerabilities and resiliencies and relationship to HIV outcomes and comorbidities, and mechanisms by which psychosocial and behavioral predictors affect outcomes. 5. Examine the biological pathway whereby psychosocial factors and substance use may increase cardiovascular disease, impair neurocognitive function and contribute to HIV persistence. 5. Utilize developmental funds to support early stage and established investigators to develop innovative pilot studies. These findings will lead to improved understanding of HIV, treatment of HIV and guide future research.

"Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center Project Summary  This application is for the renewal of the Study to Help the AIDS Research Effort (SHARE), which has been the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) since 1984. The MACS was established with sites in Baltimore-Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles, initially to study the natural history of HIV infection in men who have sex with men and later, with the advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the treated history of HIV infection, including the relationship between long-term controlled HIV infection and chronic diseases and co-morbidities associated with aging. To reflect these changing priorities in HIV research, SHARE has had subsequent enrollments to balance proportions of HIV- and HIV+ men and to reflect the HIV epidemic more accurately. Men enrolled have been followed semi annually since 1984 or enrollment and have a) provided questionnaire data, physical exam data, laboratory data (including HIV serostatus, T cell subset measurements, and HIV viral load measurements), and a large repository of plasma, serum, cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other specimens; and these have permitted SHARE and MACS to make major contributions to the understanding of treated and untreated HIV disease, and comorbidities associated with increased survival due to antiretroviral treatment.  The present application, in response to RFA-HL-19-008, aims to extend followup of the SHARE cohort (about 640 men) from 2019 to 2026, to allow merger of SHARE (and the other MACS sites) with the nine sites of the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) into a single cohort, termed the MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS), that will include both men and women. The specific aims of the CCS are outlined in a parallel application from the putative Data and Coordinating Center (DACC) of the CCS, and the 10 Specific Aims of that single cohort are outlined in the DACC application for the CCS; these include Cardiovascular (CV), Pulmonary/Sleep (PS), Neurocognitive NC), Aging (AG), Cancer, HIV Pathogenesis (PA), Psychosocial (PS), Health Disparities, Platform (PL), and Career Development (CD) Aims. The specific aims of the SHARE Clinical Research Site (CRS) are to: 1) play a leading role in the achievement 7 of these Aims by the CCS (i.e., CV, PS, AG, PA, PS, PL, and CD), including serving as a reading center for echocardiography and sleep studies; 2) to contribute to the achievement of the other 3 CCS aims, and 3) to implement all applicable CCS protocols and support the scientific goals of the CCS. Local initiatives on inflammation and physical activity will also support these aims, which take full advantage of the extensive follow-up and repository of biological specimens already available from this cohort and which will be extended under this proposal, enabling further contributions to our understanding and care of comorbidities and other health issues faced by people living with HIV today.

"Perceptions of Multipurpose Prevention Technologies Aimed at HIV/STI/unintended pregnancy among African-American Women in the Deep South PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this NIH F31- Diversity application is to obtain support for the PI, Kristina Tymes-Wilbekin, for mentored research and career development activities within her MD/PhD training that will enhance her potential to become a successful physician scientist. The project goal is to develop skills in infectious disease epidemiology and reproductive health that will allow the PI to study behavioral and socio-cultural factors that influence women’s experiences and decisions related to sexual health outcomes using mixed method study applications. The primary objective of the research proposal is to investigate potential relationships between vaginal hygiene, sexual behaviors and uptake of ring-based multipurpose prevention technologies among women at increased risk of unintended pregnancy and acquisition/transmission of sexually transmitted infections or HIV infection. Currently new vaginal rings are being developed and tested as multipurpose prevention technologies that act as a hormonal contraceptive and can prevent/treat sexually transmitted infections or HIV infection. This project is specifically focused on understanding these factors in the context of intravaginal ring delivery, due to a demonstration that a continuous contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) regimen has potential noncontraceptive and pharmacological benefits that can increase women’s adherence. This project seeks to quantitatively characterize perception of menstrual suppression among Kenyan women pre- and post-CVR use (Aim 1), and then utilize the findings for development and application of a tool to assess similar perceptions in African-American women in the Southeastern U.S. (Aims 2A and 2B). The long-term objective of our research is to better understand women’s experience with CVRs in order to inform multipurpose prevention technology development and improve sexual health options among high-risk populations.  The proposed training plan for the PI is sponsored by her project co-mentors, Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo and Dr. Sadeep Shrestha. Included within the training plan are objectives to help develop the PI in three major areas: (1) rigorous research in the STI/HIV, contraception, and multipurpose prevention technology fields, including familiarity with the existing literature, critically evaluating published studies, principles of scientific integrity and responsible conduct of research, and methods or rigor and reproducibility; and (2) infectious disease epidemiology, including methodology, study design, and biostatistical analysis; and (3) career and professional development, inclusive of communication through presentations, journal article review, learning skills in grant writing, and translation of research findings for clinical applications. The overall goal of this training plan is to give the PI a foundation for a successful progression as a physician scientist and furthering the PI’s ultimate career goal of working with a collaborative team that bridges the gap between epidemiological research and improvement in women’s reproductive and sexual health outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Southeastern U.S. has the highest rates of unintended pregnancy as well as STI/HIV infection and current efforts are met with improper use of contraception and low adherence to antiretorviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). This project is proposing to investigate behavioral and socio-cultural factors involved in contraception decisions and attitudes towards multipurpose prevention technologies by translating current knowledge from data collected in Sub-Saharan Africa to other high-risk vulnerable populations. These data will expand our understanding of women’s perceptions giving context for implementation of multipurpose prevention technologies and providing improved reproductive and sexual health

"Environmental Exposures and Cognitive Decline, Dementia, and Alzheimer's Disease Among Middle to Old age Black Men in the United States PROJECT SUMMARY Black men age-adjusted mortality rate in 2014 was 21.1 percent higher than white men. While several factors have been hypothesized to account for these differences, stress has been noted as a key determinant of Black men's health. Because of its unique position at the nexus of social factors; psychological coping; and the associated physiologic response, stress is an ideal pathway for understanding health disparities. However, stress and its downstream consequences have received relatively little attention as it relates to Black men's mortality. Over the last four years, I having been building a program of research examining social, behavioral and economic determinants of Black men's health which serves as a foundation for this mid-career Independent Scientist (K02) award application. I have two immediate career objectives. First, I want to advance my career by integrating biomarker and genetic data into my existing research portfolio to better understand the basic mechanisms of Black men's stress, and mortality (Aim 1). Second, I want to apply the biopsychosocial model for explaining links between stress and mortality in Black men (Aim 2). My long-term career objective is to establish a national network of scholars who share similar research interest and create a center on men's health and aging (Aim 3). The K02 mechanism would provide me the protected time to achieve my immediate and long-term career goals. To assist in accomplishing my aims, I will be supported by an interdisciplinary group of world renown scholars who work spans a variety of fields including health of Black Americans, biology of stress, inflammation, cognition, biomarker data, longitudinal data, mortality, gerontology and geriatrics. Further I have the support of the Department of Health, Behavior, and Society at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The proposed research and training activities have the potential to propel me from being a mid-career scientist to an independent investigator in the area of Black Men's Health and mortality. Findings from the K02 will be used to inform subsequent research objectives to address unique risks associated with health and functional outcomes to inform policy makers of the evidence for the development of policy relevant solutions for Black men. My ability to conduct high level research and effectively collaborate positions me to take full advantage of what the K02 mechanism offers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Black men have the highest age-adjusted mortality rate of all American subgroups; however, there is a paucity of research that focuses on understanding how stress links to Black men’s mortality. This project seeks to apply a biopsychosocial model for explaining the links between stress and mortality in Black men by integrating biomarker data with social, psychological, and behavioral data. Findings will be to inform subsequent research objectives to address unique risks associated with health and functional outcomes to inform policy makers of the evidence for the development of policy relevant solutions for Black men.

"Clinical Research Sites for the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS) - Baltimore/Wash DC Center - Admin Supplement: Vision and dual sensory loss in HIV-infected older adults Project Summary (from U01HL146201 cooperative agreement)  This application is for the renewal of the Study to Help the AIDS Research Effort (SHARE), which has been the Baltimore-Washington DC site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) since 1984. The MACS was established with sites in Baltimore-Washington, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles, initially to study the natural history of HIV infection in men who have sex with men and later, with the advent of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the treated history of HIV infection, including the relationship between long-term controlled HIV infection and chronic diseases and co-morbidities associated with aging. To reflect these changing priorities in HIV research, SHARE has had subsequent enrollments to balance proportions of HIV- and HIV+ men and to reflect the HIV epidemic more accurately. Men enrolled have been followed semi annually since 1984 or enrollment and have a) provided questionnaire data, physical exam data, laboratory data (including HIV serostatus, T cell subset measurements, and HIV viral load measurements), and a large repository of plasma, serum, cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and other specimens; and these have permitted SHARE and MACS to make major contributions to the understanding of treated and untreated HIV disease, and comorbidities associated with increased survival due to antiretroviral treatment.  The present application, in response to RFA-HL-19-008, aims to extend followup of the SHARE cohort (about 640 men) from 2019 to 2026, to allow merger of SHARE (and the other MACS sites) with the nine sites of the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) into a single cohort, termed the MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (CCS), that will include both men and women. The specific aims of the CCS are outlined in a parallel application from the putative Data and Coordinating Center (DACC) of the CCS, and the 10 Specific Aims of that single cohort are outlined in the DACC application for the CCS; these include Cardiovascular (CV), Pulmonary/Sleep (PS), Neurocognitive NC), Aging (AG), Cancer, HIV Pathogenesis (PA), Psychosocial (PS), Health Disparities, Platform (PL), and Career Development (CD) Aims. The specific aims of the SHARE Clinical Research Site (CRS) are to: 1) play a leading role in the achievement 7 of these Aims by the CCS (i.e., CV, PS, AG, PA, PS, PL, and CD), including serving as a reading center for echocardiography and sleep studies; 2) to contribute to the achievement of the other 3 CCS aims, and 3) to implement all applicable CCS protocols and support the scientific goals of the CCS. Local initiatives on inflammation and physical activity will also support these aims, which take full advantage of the extensive follow-up and repository of biological specimens already available from this cohort and which will be extended under this proposal, enabling further contributions to our understanding and care of comorbidities and other health issues faced by people living with HIV today.

"Measuring Fluidity in Sexual Orientation Dimensions Prospectively and Retrospectively in a National Cohort of Adolescents and Young Adults PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sexual and gender minority (SGM) adolescents and young adults (AYA) in the U.S. experience substantial health inequities due to minority stress. Research documenting SGM health inequities has been limited by inadequate methods to measure sexual fluidity (i.e., changes over time in identity and attraction dimensions of sexual orientation) retrospectively and prospectively, particularly among AYA. Measures of sexual orientation that ignore sexual fluidity may lead to incorrect assumptions about who comprises the AYA SGM population, and in turn to inaccurate estimates of population health inequities. Accurate research on SGM health inequities is critical to the allocation of resources to improve the health of SGM communities. Research documenting sexual fluidity and related SGM health inequities has been limited by methodological issues, including: (1) assessing fluidity in only one dimension of sexual orientation (either identity or attractions); (2) examining differences in fluidity by assigned sex at birth rather than by gender identity and excluding transgender and nonbinary individuals; and (3) using cross-sectional study designs with retrospective measures of sexual fluidity that may be subject to recall bias and have not been rigorously tested. Both retrospective and prospective measures of fluidity that assess multiple dimensions of sexual orientation are needed to accurately characterize health inequities among SGM AYA in cross-sectional and longitudinal research. MyVoice, a national U.S. prospective cohort of AYA (N=1280; ages 14-24 years), provides an unprecedented opportunity to measure sexual fluidity both prospectively and retrospectively among SGM and non-SGM AYA. This existing cohort study will allow us to collect measures of both sexual orientation identity and attractions at multiple time points (every 2 months across 12 months; 7 total waves) using quantitative and qualitative measures. The proposed research will use multiple sociodemographic characteristics available from MyVoice participants at the time of enrollment to consider subgroup differences in fluidity. Our specific aims are to: 1) Compare prospective and retrospective measures of fluidity in sexual orientation identity and attractions, including frequency, direction, and order of occurrence. This aim will allow us to examine changes in identity and attractions, and whether participants’ retrospective recall of sexual fluidity is consistent with their prospective report of changes in sexual orientation dimensions. 2) Examine interpretations of measures of sexual orientation and sexual fluidity. This aim will allow us to refine prospective and retrospective measures of sexual fluidity based on how participants interpret and respond to these measures, as well as increasing knowledge about how participants understand changes in sexual orientation dimensions. This research will inform prospective and retrospective measurement of sexual fluidity for use in cross-sectional and longitudinal research to improve accuracy in identifying AYA SGM populations and related health inequities, which will inform intervention efforts to improve AYA SGM health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Measures of sexual orientation that ignore sexual fluidity (i.e., changes over time in identity and attraction dimensions of sexual orientation) may lead to incorrect assumptions about who comprises the population of adolescents/young adults (AYA) who are sexual and gender minorities (SGM), and in turn to inaccurate estimates of population health inequities. Both retrospective and prospective measures of fluidity that assess multiple dimensions of sexual orientation are needed to accurately characterize health inequities among SGM AYA in cross-sectional and longitudinal research.

"Enhancing integration of HIV and mental health services for young Black gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men PROJECT SUMMARY Young Black gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (YB-GBMSM) are disproportionately impacted by HIV, with suboptimal rates of engagement across the HIV Continuum of Care (HIV-CoC). Mental health (MH) comorbidities contribute to poor HIV care engagement for many YB-GBMSM; however, effective treatment for these conditions is hindered by barriers including logistical challenges, medical mistrust, and MH stigma. The Ryan White Care act supports integration of HIV and MH services; however, our preliminary studies demonstrate low rates of MH referrals and MH care engagement among YB-GBMSM living with HIV, even in these ostensibly integrated care settings. To our knowledge, there are no published interventions designed specifically to improve MH care engagement among YB-GBMSM living with HIV. The objective of this R34 application is to develop and implement CHIMES (Cross-disciplinary HIV Integrated with Mental Health Support), a clinic- and provider-level intervention to improve HIV-MH care integration and MH care engagement among YB-GBMSM attending Ryan White clinics. The rationale for the project is that efforts to improve integration of services, particularly if they are culturally tailored, are likely to increase MH and HIV care engagement for YB-GBMSM. The proposed study will pursue two specific aims: (1) to develop the CHIMES intervention; and (2) to conduct a hybrid type 2 implementation-effectiveness pilot trial of CHIMES in two HRSA/Ryan White-funded clinics in Atlanta, Georgia – a city in the heart of the Southern HIV epidemic. For the first aim, we will work collaboratively with provider and patient stakeholders, adapt existing evidence-based interventions, and build on formative data to refine intervention content, informed by the Capability- Opportunity-Motivation-Behavior (COM-B) Model. For the second aim, we will implement CHIMES in the two clinic settings and conduct a mixed-methods assessment in which continuous data collection informed by the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework will be used to evaluate effectiveness and implementation processes. Upon completion of these aims, we will have collected rich data to inform a subsequent, larger scale implementation trial of CHIMES. We introduce significant innovations including the characterization of an integrated HIV-MH care continuum and prioritization of cultural and developmental factors (both barriers and facilitators) specific to YB-GBMSM within established implementation science frameworks. The proposed research is significant because of its potential to inform effective strategies for improving HIV viral suppression and quality of life among YB-GBMSM, leading to improved individual and public health outcomes in line with the goals of the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project seeks to develop and test an intervention to improve engagement in HIV and mental health care for young Black gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (YB-GBMSM) in Ryan White clinics. This project is relevant to public health because YB-GBMSM are disproportionately impacted by HIV and mental health conditions, but face more barriers to care for both. Further, our proposal is responsive to the NIH Office of AIDS Research mandate to conduct research to reduce disparities in health outcomes for people living with HIV, and the “Treat” pillar of the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative.","Enhancing integration of HIV and mental health services for young Black gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men",10093693,R34MH124638,"['Adoption ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Cities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Data Aggregation ', ' Aggregated Data ', ' Data Collection ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Heart ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Hybrids ', ' Interview ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' United States Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' HRSA ', ' Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Process Measure ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Masculine ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Substance-Related Disorders ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Side ', ' Clinic ', ' Viral ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' self reliance ', ' stress related disorder ', ' cultural competence ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NIH Office of AIDS Research ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' implementation trial ', ' pilot trial ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' implementation research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Prevalence ', ' Trauma ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' implementation science ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' data format ', ' sexual minority ', ' screening ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' effectiveness implementation trial ', ' effectiveness implementation hybrid ', ' effectiveness implementation study ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R34,2020,234000,-0.03287613220119151

"HIV, HCV, and gender effects on Liver, Bone, and Vascular Health PROJECT ABSTRACT I am a Professor of Medicine trained in infectious diseases (ID) and HIV epidemiology, who has developed a nationally recognized clinical translational research program focused on understanding the associations of HIV and HCV infection with adipose tissue changes, and metabolic and inflammatory perturbations, and their effects on long-term organ injury (liver, bone, and vascular). My current supported research includes: 1) a R01 that establishes a longitudinal multisite cohort of ~1500 women with HIV and/or HCV infection, and those with neither infection to determine the effects of HIV, HCV, and gonadal aging on liver steatosis and fibrosis progression using FibroScan®; 2) a second R01 and a Merck investigator-initiated award that examines the effects of HCV cure and: a) latent HIV reservoirs, immune activation, and liver fibrosis and b) novel biomarkers of kidney injury in persons treated with direct acting antiviral agents; 3) a second Merck award that examines the association of plasma levels of integrase strand inhibitors (INSTIs) with body composition changes; and 4) a U01 whose core goal is to study the long-term progression of HIV in U.S. men and women from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). My research grants leverage the infrastructure of the WIHS, which in 2019 became the MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS). For the new research to be supported by the K24 renewal, I will augment our current sample of women with ~3000 MWCCS men who will undergo FibroScan® beginning in 2020 to: 1) examine how health-related disparities (socioeconomic, behavioral and mental health conditions, i.e. income, education, region/neighborhood of residence, healthcare access, food security, and depression), biologic sex including gonadal aging, and ancestry informative markers influence steatosis and fibrosis progression; 2) investigate the biologic and immune pathways associated with steatosis and fibrosis progression using objective measurement of visceral adiposity, sex hormone levels, gut and oral microbiome analysis, plasma and hair INSTI levels obtained in the MWCCS; 3) determine how steatosis and fibrosis affects extrahepatic outcomes (cardiac, neurocognition, bone). The proposed studies will expand my research portfolio and extend the depth of my mentoring program to include mentees from an array of new disciplines (e.g. socio-behavioral sciences, endocrinology, pharmacology, and microbiology, in addition to mentees in ID, hepatology, and cardiology), and mentees from underrepresented minority (URM) groups who can effectively contribute to the HIV communities most at risk today. The MWCCS provides mentees with ready access to a rich research platform to build their careers in patient-oriented research. I plan additional training in professional and diversity leadership and how to build a structured and sustainable mentoring program in order to develop early and mid-career investigators (especially URM investigators) in HIV research, and to ensure that they will ultimately become skilled mentors themselves. PROJECT NARRATIVE With over half of men and women living with HIV now over the age of 50 years and new HIV infections mainly in minority populations, it will be of critical importance to understand the influence of health disparities (socioeconomic and behavioral conditions by biologic sex and race/ethnicity) and biologic processes (gonadal aging, adiposity, immune perturbation) on fatty liver disease and its clinical sequelae (cardiac, neurocognitive, and bone injury) in persons with HIV and HCV infection in the current era of anti‐viral treatment. I propose to expand my research program by building collaborations with mentees across a range of disciplines (e.g. hepatology, endocrinology, cardiology, neuropsychology, immunology, pharmacology) and prioritizing mentorship of underrepresented minority investigators who can effectively contribute to the HIV communities most at risk today. Together they will enrich my research program and develop the next generation of clinical investigators in high priority HIV research.","HIV, HCV, and gender effects on Liver, Bone, and Vascular

"Intersectional Stigma, Mental Health, and HIV Risk Among US Gay and Bisexual Men of Color PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The burden of HIV is far from equally distributed in the US. Key metrics of the HIV epidemic continue to be predicted by demographic factors (e.g., race, gender, sexual orientation, geography). At the intersection of these determinants is one of the highest-risk groups for HIV infection in the world, and this project's population of interest: Black and Latino gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM) in the US South. Such individuals endure multiple forms of stigma (e.g., racism, homophobia), which elevate stress and erode health. Thus, applying theories of intersectionality and minority stress to epidemiological and intervention research may provide novel insights and tools to support the health of this vulnerable subgroup. The proposed training plan will provide Skyler Jackson, PhD, with the essential knowledge and skills necessary to develop independence and forge a career advancing scientific knowledge concerning intersectional stigma as a determinant of mental and sexual health risk among Black and Latino GBM. The goals of this mentored award are summarized by three distinct training objectives: (1) to gain skills using contemporary epidemiological methods, (2) to learn best practices in qualitative, community-engaged intervention development, and (3) to develop foundational skills in clinical trials methodology. Dr. Jackson will put these aims into practice via three novel, interrelated research projects, in which he will: (1) use longitudinal data from a prospective cohort study to identify mediators and moderators of the association between intersectional stigma and mental/sexual health among GBM of color across distinct US geographies, (2) combine these findings with data from formative research (e.g., 30 interviews with GBM of color and community stakeholders in Middle Tennessee) to modify an existing evidence-based stigma-coping health intervention for GBM—using the 8-phase ADAPT-ITT model—thereby increasing its cultural and geographic relevance to the mental and sexual health of Southern Black and Latino GBM, and (3) pilot this intersectional, culturally-responsive health intervention for young Southern Black and Latino GBM (n = 30; across two sequential cohorts) in collaboration with a community partner in Middle Tennessee. To develop his independence as a scientist, Dr. Jackson will be mentored by John Pachankis, PhD (Yale University), with support from additional co-mentors: Lisa Bowleg, PhD (George Washington University), Dustin Duncan, ScD (New York University), and Mark Hatzenbuehler, PhD (Columbia University). Where knowledge gaps remain, Dr. Jackson will engage in carefully selected training activities—e.g., grant writing, coursework, conferences, and manuscript preparation. Much of this training will be made possible by institutional support available through Dr. Jackson's joint affiliation with the Yale Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS, Yale School of Public Health (YSPH), and YSPH Esteem Research Lab in New York City. Dr. Jackson's K01 training plan is optimized to address his training gaps and prepare him for a productive career as an independent scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Black and Latino gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM) residing in specific regions of the US (for example, the South) represent one of the most at-risk populations for acquiring HIV in the world. The NIMH has identified research priorities in their effort to address this enduring health inequity, including: (a) the application of intersectional research methods to study how various forms of stigma—such as racism and homophobia—jointly contribute to this health disparity through specific mediators and moderators, and (b) using this knowledge to develop targeted culturally-responsive intersectional interventions to help prevent HIV transmission among Black and Latino GBM in high-risk contexts. By clarifying whether, where, and through which mechanisms intersectional stigma serves as a fundamental driver of mental health and HIV risk—and adapting a treatment to target the mediators and moderators of these syndemic, co-occurring stigma-health effects—this project aligns with these NIMH priorities, fills a significant gap in the scientific literature, and informs intervention efforts to support the health and resilience of Southern Black and Latino GBM.","Intersectional Stigma, Mental Health, and HIV Risk Among US Gay and Bisexual Men of Color",10013513,K01MH122316,"['Acquired

"Intersectionality of Sexual Orientation, Gender Expression, and Weight Status on Risk of Disordered Eating Behaviors PA-19-195 Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award Individual Predoctoral Fellowship, NOT-MD- 19-001, Notice of Special Interest in Research on the Health of Sexual and Gender Minority Populations: A glaring sexual orientation-related disparity is in the prevalence of disordered eating behaviors (DEBs), including severe calorie restriction, self-induced vomiting, laxative and diet pill use, and binge-eating. One in three sexual minority young people (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and other non-heterosexual individuals) engage in DEBs, a seven-fold higher odds than their heterosexual peers. There are considerable health consequences associated with these behaviors, such as metabolic and reproductive health issues, substance use, depression, and suicidality. However, research on DEBs lags behind that on other sexual orientation-related health disparities, with critical gaps including failing to consider both within-group diversity in risk and the upstream social determinants of the observed disparities. Importantly, experiencing multiple forms of social disadvantage has been shown to increase risk of eating-related pathologies, including DEBs. Gender nonconforming and higher-weight (i.e., overweight/obese) statuses are especially relevant dimensions of disadvantage to consider, as these groups experience high levels of appearance-based discrimination and may use DEBs as dangerous body-modification practices to cope. Sexual minorities who experience further marginalization through membership in these groups may encounter unique and/or compounding social stressors that exacerbate risk. Examining the intersectionality of sexual orientation, gender expression, and weight status is thus critical to addressing these research gaps. Using the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS), a national longitudinal cohort study of over 27,000 participants (~20% of whom are sexual minorities), the aims of this proposal are to: 1) Quantify the intersectional effects of sexual orientation, gender expression, and weight status on risk of DEBs among young adults; 2) Quantify the effects of interpersonal-level determinants (bullying victimization, weight-based harassment) on risk of DEBs by sexual orientation, and evaluate differences by gender expression and/or weight-status; and 3) Quantify the effects of structural-level determinants (discriminatory social conditions, state policies) on risk of DEBs by sexual orientation, and evaluate differences by gender expression and/or weight-status. The National Academy of Medicine’s 2011 landmark report on sexual minority health stressed the importance of adopting an intersectional framework for disparities research to inform the development of inclusive health equity efforts. Applying this lens through leveraging novel statistical methods will further understanding of a critically understudied sexual minority health issue and help identify high-risk subgroups and modifiable contextual risk factors. A tailored training plan accompanies this proposal and outlines the steps required to advance the Applicant’s career as an independent researcher focused on intersectional health disparities research. Sexual minority populations report high rates of dangerous disordered eating behaviors, such as fasting, purging, diet pill use, and binge eating. Sexual minorities who are gender nonconforming and/or of higher-weight status (i.e. overweight/obese) may have an especially high risk of engaging in these behaviors due to compounding social stressors, although few studies have directly explored this. This study investigates the patterning and multilevel determinants of disordered eating behaviors within and across sexual minority subgroups with the intent of generating knowledge to inform future health equity efforts.","Intersectionality of Sexual Orientation, Gender Expression, and Weight Status on Risk of Disordered Eating Behaviors",10140566,F31MD015203,"['Academy ', ' Behavior ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating Disorders ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Fasting ', ' fasted ', ' fasts ', ' Fellowship ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Institutes ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentorship ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Pathology ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Stress ', ' Vomiting ', ' Emesis ', ' Weight ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Policies ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Glare ', ' Laxative Preparation ', ' laxative ', ' Metabolic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Victimization ', ' bully ', ' bullying ', ' compulsive eating ', ' compulsive feeding ', ' compulsive overeating ', ' Binge Eating ', ' Adopted ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Appearance ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' purges ', ' purging ', ' purge ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' pill ', ' caloric restricted ', ' calorically restricted ', ' calorie restricted ', ' calorie restriction ', ' Caloric Restriction ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' NIH National Research Service Award for Individual ', ' Individual National Research Service Award ', ' Subgroup ', ' Modification ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' minority health ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' pre-doc ', ' predoc ', ' predoctoral ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' high risk ', ' health equity ', ' sexual minority ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' LGB ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual ', ' gender non-conforming ', ' non-gender conforming ', ' gender nonconforming ', ' nonheterosexual ', ' non-heterosexual ', ' marginalization ', ' social exclusion ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' gender difference ', ' intersectionalities ', ' intersectionality ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' gender expression ', ' social disadvantage ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' social stressor ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,F31,2020,32882,0.055339010222228965
"MACS/WIHS -CCS ABSTRACT Nearly half the men and women with HIV infection are racial/ethnic minorities living in the South. HIV infection remains a major public health problem despite the availability of treatments. The purpose of this proposal is to advance the knowledge of the consequences of HIV infection, with a focus on HIV-related comorbidities, by participating as a Clinical Research Sites (CRS) of the Multi-Center AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS-CCS). To meet this goal, Miami will provide expertise to lead important components of the CCS unified science agenda with protocol development and laboratory support to protocols and sub studies, as well as implementing the full CCS unified science agenda. To accomplish this, we will enroll and follow 500 men and women with HIV infection or at risk for HIV. We will enroll approximately 250 men reflective of the HIV epidemic in Miami, and follow men who have sex with men, bisexual men, and heterosexual men including men who are black or Hispanic representing a large minority proportion. As a current Southern WIHS site we will continue to follow the 149 women enrolled in WIHS who have HIV infection or at risk for HIV and are largely minority reflecting the Miami HIV epidemic. With availability of the CCS protocol, we will enroll additional 100 women from the community to reach a goal of approximately 250 women. The men and women enrolled will be consistent with protocol requirements of the MACS/WIHS consortium for new enrollments. Miami will continue its strong leadership, as we provided for the WIHS. Dr. Fischl as lead PI for this multiple PI proposal is the Vice Chair of the WIHS and has had an active role, along with colleagues, in the development of the unified science agenda, including the specific aims, frequency of core protocol visits, and timing of clinical tests, specimen collections, surveys, assessments and clinical tests. The Miami CRS will focus on protocols and sub studies in several innovative areas.1. Explore cardiovascular outcomes and HIV progression in the syndemic of HIV, tobacco, stimulant use, and depression, and investigate inflammatory biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk and immune activation, including sex differences. 2. Explore the effects of the oral, female genital, and gut microbiome on the HIV reservoir and on exposure to antiretroviral therapy. 3. Evaluate comorbidities and effect of HIV persistence, inflammation and immune markers on comorbidity outcomes and plasma markers of inflammation, amyloid pathology and innate immune cell phenotypes on disease outcomes. 4. Examine the trajectories of vulnerabilities and resiliencies and relationship to HIV outcomes and comorbidities, and mechanisms by which psychosocial and behavioral predictors affect outcomes. 5. Examine the biological pathway whereby psychosocial factors and substance use may increase cardiovascular disease, impair neurocognitive function and contribute to HIV persistence. 5. Utilize developmental funds to support early stage and established investigators to develop innovative pilot studies. These findings will lead to improved understanding of HIV, treatment of HIV and guide future research.

"Identifying, refining, and testing sexual orientation and gender identity measures to detect and delineate sexual and gender minority populations for population research PROJECT SUMMARY  Reliable and efficient methods of measuring sexual and gender minority (SGM) status, that are acceptable to both SGM and non-SGM people, are needed so that researchers can more accurately capture and better understand the health of SGM individuals. Current measures are limited in how they operationalize assessment of the many constitutive domains of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI), the diversity of answer choices, and in accounting for changes in SOGI domains over one’s life. Further, the sexual orientation domains (i.e., attraction, identity, behavior) and gender domains (i.e., gender identity, gender expression) evaluated often result in wide variation in SGM population estimates, discrepancies in health risk factors, experiences, and outcomes.  To more accurately identify SGM people, measures must ultimately be intelligible and acceptable to the entire population. The importance of this was underscored after the 2010 Census, where mismarks on the sex question by opposite-sex couples led to inflated estimates of same-sex households. Until well tested, reliable, and community-acceptable measures are developed, SGM individuals will continue to be underrepresented and understudied in research. Non-SGM individuals will also continue to be miss-measured and overburdened.  In this proposal, a mixed methods approach for developing and describing the performance characteristics of a reliable, low-burden, community acceptable SGM status screening question is outlined. Leveraging two large national cohorts, response accuracy within this strategy as well as participant understanding and acceptability will be measured through iterative quantitative testing among both SGM and non-SGM individuals. The overall hypothesis is that using a screener question of SGM status followed by more specific follow-up testing with expanded answer choices for SGM individuals will decrease survey burden for non-SGM people while also allowing SGM people to be identified and affirmed. First, a broadly acceptable SGM screening question will be developed and piloted using cognitive interviews and online pilot testing. The best performing screening question will then be compared head-to-head with simultaneous administration of two set of SOGI measures. Finally, the SGM status screening question and existing confirmatory SOGI measures’ stability and acceptability over time will be analyzed to evaluate performance characteristics and demographic differences in answer choice patterns.  Accurate identification and inclusive data collection are critical to improving outcomes and reducing disparities. In summary, the proposed research will develop a high-performing, efficient strategy for identifying SGM people. Project Narrative Significant gaps remain in scientifically rigorous and community-acceptable ways to identify sexual and gender minority (SGM) people, an understudied and underserved population with significant health disparities. The proposed strategy outlines the development and testing of a novel, low-burden SGM status screening tool to facilitate the informed implementation of follow- up sexual orientation and gender identity measures, a necessary advance to deepen our understanding of, and ultimately eradicating, SGM health disparities.","Identifying, refining, and testing sexual orientation and gender identity measures to detect and delineate sexual and gender minority populations for population research",10127866,R21MD015878,"['Accounting ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Censuses ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Couples ', ' Data Collection ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Ovary ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Writing ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Individual ', ' Gays ', ' Respondent ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Categories ', ' performance tests ', ' response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Population-based research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' minority health ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' screening ', ' Intersex ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Same-sex ', ' improved outcome ', ' cis-gender ', ' cisgender ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' differences in health ', ' health difference ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' cognitive interview ', ' LGBTQ ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer ', ' gender expression ', ' ']",NIMHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,239358,0.04559817678463527
"Improving mortality data through postmortem measurement of sexual orientation and gender identity Project Summary The health risk literature suggests that sexual and gender minority (SGM) people are more likely to die by violent death than their non-SGM peers (e.g., SGM people are over 2-4 times more likely to attempt suicide than non-SGM people), but because sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data are not systematically collected at the time of the death, disparities in mortality cannot be assessed to inform prevention and intervention. The goal of this proposed project is to demonstrate the feasibility of collecting SOGI following a violent death. Because we have worked closely with medicolegal death investigators, coroners, and medical examiners to develop a training for death investigators to gather SOGI data postmortem, our team is uniquely poised to achieve the proposed study goal, which befits the exploratory and developmental purposes of the R21 mechanism. We aim to: (1) assess feasibility of training death investigators to implement postmortem measurement of SOGI among decedents of violent death, and (2) examine death investigators' fidelity of measuring SOGI after the initial SOGI training. To conduct this research, we will partner with the Los Angeles County Department of the Medical Examiner-Coroner and the Office of the Medical Examiner for the Utah Department of Health in Salt Lake City, UT. For Aim 1, we will use quantitative and qualitative methods to examine feasibility of training at both sites. Using monthly case summaries, we hypothesize that the rate of investigators' cases with SOGI measurement will significantly increase over time from one-month prior to training through 6 months after training. Beginning 6-months post training, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with death investigators to explore facilitators and barriers of measuring SOGI in the dynamic contexts of investigations and gather advice, guidance, and caveats from them to contribute to best practices for SOGI measurement in death investigation. For Aim 2, a 4-person expert panel will use document analysis to review random samples of de- identified case narratives from 6 categories (i.e., sexual minority, heterosexual, sexual orientation undetermined, transgender/non-binary, cisgender, gender identity undetermined), identifying themes of similarities and differences in documentation within and between categories of cases. Our proposal aligns with the RFA-MD-20-005 objective for “research that examines the performance, utility, and acceptability of new or existing measures,” but it takes an approach that is unique from typical SOGI measurement studies that are in vivo because we address major gaps preventing SOGI measurement postmortem. Because of this unique approach, the proposed research responds directly to the National Institute of Mental Health's programmatic interest “to improve the collection of SOGI data following a suicide and/or other violent death.” Project Narrative The goal of this research is to demonstrate the feasibility of collecting sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) following a violent death. Health risk literature suggests that sexual and gender minority (SGM) people are more likely to die by violent death than their non-SGM peers (e.g., SGM people are over 2-4 times more likely to attempt suicide than non-SGM people), but because SOGI data are not systematically collected at the time of the death, actual mortality disparities are unknown. This research fills a glaring gap in SGM research and will transform mortality data collection to include SOGI, which facilitates studies to guide prevention and intervention research around preventable deaths among SGM populations.",Improving mortality data through postmortem measurement of sexual orientation and gender identity,10127489,R21MH125360,"['Accreditation ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Child Abuse ', ' Childhood Abuse ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Coroners and Medical Examiners ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medical Examiners ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Sodium Chloride ', ' salt ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Utah ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' improved ', ' Suicide precaution ', ' prevent suicidality ', ' prevent suicide ', ' suicidality prevention ', ' suicide intervention ', ' Suicide prevention ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Training ', ' homeless ', ' unhoused ', ' Homelessness ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Glare ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' interest ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' peer ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' R21 Program ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' investigator training ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' suicide rate ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' Guide prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' sexual minority ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' cis-gender ', ' cisgender ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' mortality disparity ', ' minority communities ', ' preventable mortality ', ' preventable death ', ' sexual identity ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R21,2020,214840,0.043158924375450256
"The Effect of Sex Hormones on Cardiometabolic Outcomes in Men and Women with Diabetes: The Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) Study Although women and men have about an equal prevalence of type 2 diabetes (DM), DM imposes a clinically significant excess relative risk of coronary heart disease (44% higher), stroke (27% higher) and vascular dementia (19% higher) in women compared to men. Understanding these sex differences could inform research to improve DM outcomes for both women and men. Postulated reasons for the “female disadvantage” include an adverse cardiometabolic profile (particularly greater obesity) and disparities in aggressiveness of CV preventive treatments (e.g. use of statins). In addition, differences in endogenous sex hormones, including estradiol (E2), testosterone (T) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), may contribute to the excess risk for women conferred by DM. Although lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and weight loss) are the cornerstone of diabetes management, it is not known if weight loss and healthier lifestyle can modulate the trajectory of sex hormones over time, and the role of these hormonal changes on cardiometabolic risk factors. The Action for Health In Diabetes (Look AHEAD) Study was a randomized controlled trial among 5,145 overweight individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes designed to evaluate the effect of an Intensive Lifestyle Intervention (ILI) compared to a control group on incident CVD events. A major strength of Look AHEAD is its capacity to address questions of causation, because study participants were followed over 8 years (~3000 with longitudinal biospecimens for sex hormone measurements), with significant and well-characterized alterations in weight and with adjudicated clinical outcomes. In this proposal, we will first analyze the stored biospecimens for sex hormones (E2, T), SHBG and albumin. We will then 1) Test whether the ILI improves endogenous sex hormones over time and whether the effect of ILI is moderated by sex; 2) Evaluate the longitudinal associations between endogenous sex hormones and cardiometabolic risk factors (HbA1c, lipid levels, body mass index and weight, waist circumference, body composition, blood pressure) (primary outcomes); 3) Test the effect of the time-trajectory of endogenous sex hormones on improving cardio-metabolic risk factors and long term DM outcomes (i.e. CVD, stroke, chronic kidney disease and vascular dementia) over 8 years of followup, and whether differences exist by sex. Our overall hypothesis is that ILI improves the sex hormone profile, and that an unfavorable sex hormone profile, i.e. high free T in women and low free T in men, is associated with an adverse cardiometabolic risk profile. Ultimately, understanding the biological role of sex hormones in DM could target treatments, particularly lifestyle modification, and inform the prevention of CVD and other DM complications, to reduce DM-related morbidity and mortality for both women and men. Type 2 diabetes confers a greater excess risk of cardiovascular disease in women than in men. We propose to use The Look AHEAD (Action for Health In Diabetes) Study to examine the association between endogenous sex hormones (testosterone, estradiol and sex hormone binding globulin) and cardiovascular disease risk factors, over 8 years, by sex, and in response to the intensive lifestyle intervention among 3000 study participants with type 2 diabetes.",The Effect of Sex Hormones on Cardiometabolic Outcomes in Men and Women with Diabetes: The Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) Study,10102514,R01DK127222,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Albumins ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Body Composition ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Control Groups ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Vascular Dementia ', ' Arteriosclerotic Dementia ', ' vascular contributions to dementia ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Estradiol ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Diogyn ', ' Diogynets ', ' Estrace ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estraldine ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Progynon ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Lipids ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Morbidity -

"Examining Modifiable Psychosocial Predictors of HIV Seroconversion in a Large Nationwide Cohort of High Risk Men Project Summary Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) remain a population in the U.S. for whom the burden of HIV is high and disproportionate, particularly among younger GBMSM and GBMSM of color, for whom HIV incidence continues to rise despite decades of HIV prevention research to curb the epidemic. However, even among these highest risk groups, risk for infection is not equivalent and the goal of this study is to better understand what factors differentiate levels of risk for HIV infection. Research to date suggests that this disproportionate burden is likely to be exacerbated by psychosocial disparities faced by this population in the form of syndemics and sexual minority stress. However, research on these factors has been limited by a focus on risk for HIV infection operationalized as risk behavior or cross-sectional prevalence of HIV, making actual vulnerability to infection and temporal associations difficult, if not impossible, to determine. We are submitting this application in response to RFA-AI-16-031 Limited Interaction Targeted Epidemiology (LITE) to Advance HIV Prevention (UG3/UH3). We propose to recruit and enroll a large and diverse cohort of approximately 8,000 GBMSM ages 16 and older in the U.S. and Puerto Rico who are at high risk for infection. We will utilize mobile sexual networking applications (“mobile apps”) to identify and enroll these men both to allow for rapid and efficient recruitment and because these apps rapidly increasing in popularity, with research demonstrating that men who use mobile apps are at higher levels of risk for HIV infection than GBMSM recruited through other means. Using this cohort, we will work to achieve three primary aims: (1) we will establish HIV prevalence as well as prevalence of rectal sexually transmitted infections (STIs; gonorrhea and chlamydia) at baseline and subsequently establish rates of HIV and rectal STI incidence among these men 12 months thereafter; (2) we will utilize baseline levels of syndemic, minority stress, and other relevant psychosocial risk factors to develop a model of those modifiable factors that contribute to increased risk for HIV seroconversion (i.e., incidence) as well as rectal STI infection; (3) we will utilize the model to target men in the highest quartile of risk for HIV seroconversion in the cohort and follow them every 6 months thereafter for an additional two years to examine the predictive utility in prospectively predicting HIV seroconversion as well as time to seroconversion. Developing a model of modifiable psychosocial risk factors for actual HIV seroconversion and subsequently testing its reliability and validity in a prospective design has high potential to improve the next generation of HIV prevention interventions aimed at reducing disparities for this population. Project Narrative Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are at disproportionately high risk for HIV infection compared to other groups, but little research has been powered to examine factors associated with their increased susceptibility as measured with biological indicators and prospective HIV serconversion (i.e., incidence). In this study, we will establish a large nationwide cohort of GBMSM at risk for HIV and follow them longitudinally to examine psychosocial predictors of seroconversion. Specifically, we will integrate two prominent psychosocial models of HIV risk for GBMSM—syndemics and minority stress—to identify modifiable targets for future intervention that increase are associated with risk for HIV as measured by rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia infection in addition to actual HIV infection (i.e., seroconversion).",Examining Modifiable Psychosocial Predictors of HIV Seroconversion in a Large Nationwide Cohort of High Risk Men,10235565,UH3AI133674,"['Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Goals ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' rectal ', ' Distal ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Gays ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention program ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' high risk ', ' HIV/STI ', ' STD/HIV ', ' STI/HIV ', ' HIV/STD ', ' sexual minority ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' seroconversion ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' recruit ', ' infection risk ', ' anal intercourse without condom ', ' anal sex without condom ', ' condomless anal intercourse ', ' unprotected anal intercourse ', ' unprotected anal sex ', ' unsafe anal intercourse ', ' unsafe anal sex ', ' condomless anal sex ', ' rate of infection ', ' infection rate ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Child Sexual Abuse ', ' Child Sexual Molestation ', ' childhood sexual abuse ', ' juvenile sex abuse ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' bedsonia ', ' Chlamydia Infections ', ' Chlamydial Infection ', ' chlamydial disease ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Color ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' ']",NIAID,HUNTER COLLEGE,UH3,2020,158153,0.030931711783501466

"Does sex matter? Targeting sex differences in age-related lung disease Currently, well-recognized, yet unexplained age and sex related differences in age-associated lung disease may reflect actions of gonadal hormones and/or genes encoded on the sex chromosomes. The gap in knowledge addressed in this proposal centers on whether this sex disparity is due to activational effects of gonadal hormones (differential effects due to estrogen or testosterone) and/or sex chromosome complement. This proposal has high impact since sex chromosome genes and/or sex hormones could potentiate protective factors in females or harmful factors in males. This proposal is high risk as it goes beyond the simple idea that gonadal hormones are the only players that make females different from males. We break down sex-biasing factors into their component parts (e.g., hormones, sex chromosomes, and sex chromosome genes) and manipulate each component while holding others constant to assess their contribution to the sex difference. Preliminary data in this proposal show that in lung tissue obtained from male patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a fatal form of pulmonary fibrosis more common in middle aged and elderly men, there is a 30- fold increase in androgen receptor (AR) mRNA accompanied by an increase in AR receptor protein. This data strongly support the idea that activation by testosterone could promote downstream fibrotic pathways in an age-associated lung disease like IPF. We hypothesize that a) aging male patients with IPF have more severe lung disease due to androgen receptor-activated fibrotic pathways and b) sex differences in lung fibrosis are caused in part by genes encoded by the sex chromosomes. Discovery of new mechanisms to account for the sex disparity in age-associated lung fibrosis will uncover protective and/or harmful factors that may lead to new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. To detect sex-specific differential pathways we will perform the following Aims: Aim 1: Determine the activational effects of gonadal hormones/respective receptors and subsequent downstream signaling that contribute to age-associated lung disease. A.These studies gonadectomize (GDX) aging male and female BLM-treated mice to determine if estrogens are protective and androgens harmful to lung fibrosis. B. Determine the contribution of AR and ER in the development of lung fibrosis using myofibroblasts isolated from lungs of male and female patients with IPF. Aim 2: Determine whether sex chromosomes contribute to sex differences in age-associated lung disease using the four core genotypes (FCG) mouse model. This model separates the effects of gonadal sex (ovaries versus testes) from the sex chromosome complement (XX vs. XY) by producing XX and XY gonadal males and XX and XY gonadal females and will be done in collaboration with Dr. Arthur Arnold. Aging is a complex process that proceeds at a difference pace in men and women in many organs. A number of factors, including gonadal hormones, genes encoded on the sex chromosomes, and gender-related behaviors, could contribute to differences in age-associated lung disease between men and women. It is important that studies regarding the pathogenesis of age-related diseases address the influence of sex.",Does sex matter?

"MOCHA Moving Forward:  a CBPR investigation of chronic disease prevention in older, low-income African-American men ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research is designed to use a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach to achieve three research objectives: (1) to identify factors that can be incorporated into expanded Minority Stress Model developed by the PI; (2) to evaluate the effectiveness of the Men of Color Health Awareness (MOCHA) program, and an enhanced MOCHA+ program that uses narrative communication strategies, in lowering stress and risk of chronic diseases in a randomized controlled trial; and (3) to determine those individual, interpersonal and social structural factors that have an impact on stress and the health of low income African- American men. The MOCHA program is the result of a grassroots, community-driven initiative to address the heavy burden of health disparities experienced by low-income African-American men living in Springfield MA. The MOCHA program is sustained by a public - private collaboration between the local chapter of the YMCA and the state Department of Public Health. The MOCHA program is designed to address the physical, mental, social, and spiritual needs of men of color simultaneously in an integrated fashion. It consists of a 12-week program comprised of: (1) 60-minutes of moderately intensive aerobic exercise twice a week; (2) small group discussions of issues facing men of color, in particular, the potentially harmful effects of socially constructed definitions of black masculinity and associated issues of stress, violence, depression and substance abuse; (3) classes on health topics pertinent to chronic disease control, such as nutrition, obesity, high blood pressure, fitness and the social determinants of health. In utilizing a CBPR methodology, university researchers will partner with the MOCHA Steering Committee in all phases of the research, from identifying the main research questions, to identifying mediating factors implicit in the MOCHA model to utilizing appropriate research instruments to answer the primary research question, to data collection and analysis, to disseminating the results of the research, in appropriate fashion, to different audiences. The proposed research methods include: individual interviews of MOCHA participants, ethnographic field observations of digital storytelling (DST) workshops, survey questionnaires and the collection of physiological measures such as cortisol, blood pressure, and BMI. The results of this research will contribute to the identification of effective interventins to address health disparities in low-income African-American men and the dissemination of effective chronic disease prevention programming. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African-American men continue to bear a disproportionate share of the burden of health disparities, in general, and chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes, in particular. It is vitally important to identify effective strategies to ameliorate these health inequities. The research plan presented here will identify factors that have the greatest influence on stress and health behaviors in low-income African-American men between the ages 45-65, and determine the effectiveness of an innovative, community-driven program to improve the health and quality of life of these men.","MOCHA Moving Forward:  a CBPR investigation of chronic disease prevention in older, low-income African-American men",9859228,R01MD010618,"['Aerobic Exercise ', ' Aerobic Activity ', ' Aerobic fitness ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Awareness ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ', ' ELISA ', ' Exercise ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Interview ', ' Logic ', ' Massachusetts ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mission ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Morbidity -

"Still Climbin': A Randomized Controlled Trial of an Intervention to Improve Coping with Discrimination, Address Medical Mistrust, and Reduce Health Disparities among Black Sexual Minority Men PROJECT SUMMARY Black men, especially Black sexual minority men (SMM), are negatively affected by health and healthcare disparities: They show worse outcomes for preventable conditions and preventable complications from chronic conditions, and are less likely to engage with healthcare than are White men and women. Moreover, Black SMM display strikingly high rates of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Based on evidence-based theory that discrimination contributes meaningfully to disparities, we propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an 8-session culturally congruent cognitive behavior therapy group intervention, Still Climbin’, which aims to increase effective coping responses to discrimination (from intersectional race and sexual minority identities) and reduce medical mistrust among Black SMM, with the goal of improving healthcare engagement and receipt of evidence-based preventive care. Still Climbin’ has a strong scientific basis in our prior pilot work, which found that the proposed intervention is acceptable to key stakeholders, feasible to conduct, and associated with improved effective coping. The specific aims are: (1) To conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the effects of Still Climbin', a culturally congruent cognitive behavior therapy group intervention, on healthcare engagement (e.g., at least one ambulatory visit in the past 6 months) and receipt of evidence-based preventive care (e.g., chronic disease screenings) among Black sexually minority men; (2) To examine mechanisms of the intervention’s effects on improved healthcare engagement and receipt of evidence-based preventive care, including more effective coping skills and reduced medical mistrust; and (3) To examine potential moderators of the intervention’s effects (e.g., age, HIV-serostatus and other health conditions). In the context of established community-academic partnerships, we will conduct the RCT with 300 Black SMM, randomizing 150 to the intervention group and 150 to a wait-list control group. Participants will complete surveys at baseline and 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-baseline to assess the primary outcomes, and potential mediators, covariates, and moderators. Healthcare engagement, receipt of evidence-based care, and health conditions will be verified with medical records. With the exception of our own work, we are not aware of any interventions that address coping with discrimination from intersectional identities in order to improve health outcomes among Black SMM. Our research is consistent with Healthy People 2020, which recommends developing interventions to address effects of discrimination among sexual minority individuals. Although structural-level interventions are critical for reducing societal discrimination as a long-term strategy, individual- level interventions—such as Still Climbin’—are needed in tandem to reduce discrimination’s immediate health effects. PROJECT NARRATIVE Large racial/ethnic and sexual minority health and healthcare disparities exist for preventable conditions in the U.S., and discrimination is thought to be a major contributor. We propose a randomized controlled trial of an 8- session culturally congruent cognitive behavior therapy group intervention that aims to increase healthcare engagement and receipt of evidence-based preventive care by increasing effective coping responses to discrimination (from race and sexual minority identity) and reducing medical mistrust among Black sexual minority men.","Still Climbin': A Randomized Controlled Trial of an Intervention to Improve Coping with Discrimination, Address Medical Mistrust, and Reduce Health Disparities among Black Sexual Minority Men",9858817,R01MD014722,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Black race ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Medical Records ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Names ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Support Groups ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Societies ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Weather ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Coping Skills ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Community prevention programs ', ' Prevention ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Psychosocial Effect ', ' Treatment/Psychosocial Effects ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' arm ', ' sexual minority ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' recruit ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' ']",NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2020,652736,0.05896779743084506
"Multilevel risk profiles and reproductive health across adolescence and young adulthood. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sexual and reproductive health continues to be a public health concern. In this United States, rates of sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy are highest among adolescents and young adults, making prevention programs to this group to be particularly important. Longitudinal data now exists that can give greater insight into the factors that underlie sexual and reproductive health outcomes develop across adolescence and young adulthood, but new analytic methods are necessary to unlock the full potential of this data. We propose the use and integration of two innovative analytic methods, the time-varying effect modeling (TVEM) and latent class analysis (LCA) to long-term longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). This project has three specific aims. The first aim will elucidate age trends in SRH outcomes (e.g., sexual risk behaviors, STIs, unintended pregnancy) across adolescence through young adulthood at the population level. We will examine how these age-varying trends differ by demographic subgroups (biological sex, race/ethnicity, and sexual minority status). The second aim will examine how profiles of multilevel early risk factors (e.g., parent, peer, neighborhood) predict sexual and reproductive health outcomes across adolescence through young adulthood, and how these age-varying associations differ by demographic subgroup. Finally, the third aim will examine how age-varying individual factors differentially predict SRH outcomes across adolescence and young adulthood, and how these associations differ by demographic subgroups and membership in the early risk profile classes determined in Aim 2. This project will provide population-level knowledge on the developmental course of SRH outcomes, processes which underlie these outcomes, and how they differ by subgroup. Results will allow prevention scientists to design interventions targeting the most relevant risk factors at particular ages for specific subgroups. To maximize the project’s overall impact, published manuscripts will include details of the statistical models and programming syntax so that researchers can use these approaches to answer new questions about age-varying processes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescents and young adults are at risk of negative sexual and reproductive health outcomes; however, new approaches are needed to unlock insights from data collected across development in order for researchers to understand the multilevel predictors and developmental nature of sexual risk. This study will apply novel analytic methods to data from a nationally representative longitudinal study from adolescence through young adulthood to determine how rates of sexual and reproductive health outcomes change across development, how these are predicted by early social-ecological risk factors and individual risk factors at different ages, and how these age-varying effects differ for population subgroups. This project will allow prevention scientists to design interventions that target the most promising mechanisms at particular ages, for specific subgroups.",Multilevel risk profiles and reproductive health across adolescence and young adulthood.,9884796,R03HD096101,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Felis catus ', ' Cats ', ' Cats Mammals ', ' Domestic Cats ', ' Feline Species ', ' Felis domestica ', ' Felis domesticus ', ' Felis sylvestris catus ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Family ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Infertility ', ' Cannot achieve a pregnancy ', ' Difficulty conceiving ', ' fertility cessation ', ' fertility loss ', ' infertile ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Methods ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Probability Models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Pelvis ', ' Pelvic ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Poverty ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' analytical method ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' insight ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' sexually active ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' behavior change ', ' syntactic ', ' syntax ', ' Manuscripts ', ' condoms ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Unplanned pregnancy ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' time use ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' demographics ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' sexual minority ', ' Adolescent and Young Adult ', ' sexually active teen ', ' sexually active youth ', ' sexually active adolescent ', ' Developmental Course ', ' secondary analysis ', ' STD prevention ', ' prevent sexually transmitted disease ', ' prevent sexually transmitted infections ', ' sexually transmitted disease prevention ', ' sexually transmitted infection prevention ', ' STI prevention ', ' protective factors ', ' sex risk behavior ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' biological sex ', ' cost estimation ', ' cost estimate ', ' ']",NICHD,SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,80619,-0.005599104501703037
"Designing an Intervention to Increase Men's Linkage to Care and Prevention after HIV Self-Testing in Uganda PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The success of HIV treatment and prevention in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is hindered by the gender disparity in access to care. Men in SSA are less likely to undergo HIV testing and more likely to start antiretroviral treatment (ART) at advanced disease stages compared to women, resulting in poorer clinical outcomes. HIV self-testing (HIVST) is shown to be an innovating and empowering method to increase HIV testing coverage in men. In particular, secondary distribution of HIV self-tests to men from their female partners has achieved high uptake in men. However, men’s linkage to care after HIVST is not well evaluated. As clinic linkage is a crucial step to accessing lifesaving ART and prevention including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), the success of HIVST interventions in reducing HIV burden hinges on their ability to link individuals to care. The goal of this K01 Award is to broaden the candidate’s expertise to conduct independent research in global HIV prevention, with a focus on optimizing HIVST and linkage strategies. To complete this research, the candidate will develop new competencies in 1) qualitative research and behavioral science, 2) behavioral economics, and 3) implementation science. These skills build nicely on the candidate’s current proficiencies in epidemiology, mathematical modeling, and cost-effectiveness analyses. This newly developed skillset will enable the candidate to design, evaluate, and adapt locally relevant and scalable HIV interventions to reduce HIV burden in SSA. The candidate has assembled a robust, multidisciplinary mentorship team to guide her research and career development. The research will be conducted in Kampala, Uganda, within a Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) clinic. This is an ideal setting in which to evaluate the effectiveness of secondary distribution of HIV self-tests. Pregnant women commonly report not knowing the HIV-status of their male partner. Furthermore, testing partners of HIV-positive women is a high yield strategy to identify HIV-positive men in need of ART as well as HIV-negative men serodiscordant partnerships who can benefit from PrEP and VMMC. Interviews will be conducted with men regarding their barriers and motivators for linkage and with providers/stakeholders regarding the feasibility of integrating the potential interventions into clinic practice (Aim 1). Using the intervention characteristics identified in Aim 1, the candidate will create and administer a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) to men with HIV-positive female partners (Aim 2). The DCE elicit characteristics of men’s preferred HIVST intervention, which will be used to develop a tailored intervention for optimal uptake. Finally, the candidate will pilot-test the optimal HIV-self testing intervention to 50 pregnant women starting PMTCT and their male partners. She will evaluate the intervention’s acceptability and effectiveness in linking men to confirmatory HIV testing, treatment and prevention (Aim 3). This research is the first to evaluate an intervention to motivate male linkage to care after HIV self-testing. It has the potential to identify strategies to increase HIV testing and linkage to care in SSA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT (PROJECT NARRATIVE) Men in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are less likely than women to test for HIV and link to treatment and prevention, resulting in poorer clinical outcomes. Innovate HIV self-testing strategies demonstrate high male uptake and have the potential to increase HIV testing coverage, but methods to link men to care after HIV self-testing are not well evaluated. This research will study men’s barriers and motivators to clinic linkage after HIV self-testing and pilot-test a feasible and scalable intervention to increase linkage to care; this intervention will be designed and tailored for use in prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) clinics in SSA.",Designing an Intervention to Increase Men's Linkage to Care and Prevention after HIV Self-Testing in Uganda,9993607,K01MH115789,"['Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Male Circumcision ', ' Circumcision ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Couples ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Interview ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Postpartum Women ', ' Post-partum Women ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expectant mother ', ' expecting mother ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Syphilis ', ' great pox ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Uganda ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Vertical Transmission ', ' mother to child transmission ', ' Vertical Disease Transmission ', ' uptake ', ' Letters ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' preference ', ' empowered ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' advanced illness ', ' advanced disease ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' career development ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' Data ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' epidemiological model ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' implementation science ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard of care ', ' successful intervention ', ' treatment adherence ', ' financial reward ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial incentive ', ' screening ', ' behavioral economics ', ' gender disparity ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' antepartum ', ' antenatal ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' Wait Time ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' Infrastructure ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K01,2020,175403,0.044543699667639367
"Suicide Prevention for Sexual and Gender Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death among all U.S. citizens and is the 2nd leading cause of death among youth and emerging adults between the ages of 15 and 29. One group that is particularly vulnerable to suicide is sexual and gender minorities (SGMs). SGM is an umbrella term used to describe individuals who identify as non-exclusively heterosexual (e.g., gay, lesbian, bisexual) and/or as transgender/non-binary (e.g., identify as a gender different from their birth sex). Indeed, recent U.S. representative findings from 2017 underscore striking disparities in suicidality between sexual minority and heterosexual adolescents, with 23% of sexual minority youth reporting one or more suicide attempts (in the past 12 months) vs. 5.4% of heterosexual youth. Prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts among gender minorities is also substantially elevated compared to the general population, with 45% of 18-24-year-old transgender individuals reporting a history of one more suicide attempts. Despite these substantial health disparities in suicide among SGM youth/emerging adults, no known suicide prevention programs exist for this highly vulnerable population. Given this crucial gap in the literature, the proposed study will adapt and test an innovative intervention that integrates patient navigation with the Safety Planning Intervention (PN+SPI) for SGM youth/emerging adults designed to target mechanisms (e.g., reductions in thwarted belongingness and increases in suicide-related coping skills) that theoretically underlie suicide. If the PN+SPI intervention displays a clinically meaningful effect on the purported targets (i.e., reductions in thwarted belongingness and increases in suicide-related coping skills) during the open-phase trial (R61 phase) and is feasible and acceptable, we will subsequently move to the R33 phase. In the R33 phase, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of the PN+SPI by comparing it to SPI alone to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. During the randomized controlled trial, in which we will sample 170 youth and emerging adult SGMs, we will also evaluate the mechanisms of action of the PN+SPI intervention through longitudinal analysis. The proposed project has substantial public health significance as SGMs are one of the most vulnerable groups for suicidality globally. Given the brevity of the PN+SPI intervention and its emphasis on safety planning and accessing community resources, the PN+SPI intervention has high potential for wide dissemination and public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth and emerging adults are at high risk of suicide attempts and death by suicide, and no known suicide prevention programs exist for this vulnerable population. The proposed study will adapt and test an intervention that integrates patient navigation with safety planning to prevent suicide.

"Surviving the HIV Epidemic (S/HE) in metropolitan Washington DC - Advancing knowledge through cohort studies ABSTRACT About 1.1 million people are living with HIV (PLWH) in the US, with an estimated 39,782 individuals newly diagnosed with HIV in 2016. The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) are two of the longest standing HIV cohort studies in the United States. Established in 1984 and 1993, respectively, these US-based cohorts currently follow 2,235 men and 2,304 women living with HIV, alongside high-risk but uninfected controls. HIV is at epidemic proportions in the nation’s capital, with overall HIV prevalence of 1.9% among the District of Columbia (DC) adult and adolescent residents. Approximately 3.7% of DC residents aged 40 to 49 years and 5.2% of residents aged 50 to 59 years are living with HIV. The highest life time risk of acquiring HIV in the U.S. is highest in DC with an estimated 1 in 17 individuals anticipated to acquire HIV in their lifetime, followed by 1 in 56 risk among the neighboring Maryland residents. Continuing to follow the women we have recruited and expanding our cohort to include a representative group of men and women is imperative in this region with epidemic levels of HIV. Our research will be focused on understanding the behavioral and social determinants that contribute to long term treatment success and failure, with a focus on identifying key resilience factors that may translate into innovative interventions to achieve the global goals of the HIV care continuum, to improve treatment uptake and viral suppression to decrease morbidity and mortality. We have four aims to achieve our goals. (1) To continue our strong collaborative relationship with the national MACS/WIHS CCS in protocol development, implementation, participant enrollment, retention, data acquisition, and sub-study participation; (2) To lead the CCS-wide effort to understand the psychosocial and behavioral determinants that contributes to treatment adherence, virologic suppression, and healthy coping among PLWH in the US; (3) To determine the effectiveness of treatment and prevention guidelines and identify disparities in service delivery for common morbidities with high associated mortality; and (4) To explore HIV, aging, and associated co-morbidities, including the role of microvascular/vascular function, the microbiome, neurocognitive decline in the context of contemporary antiretroviral treatment regimens, and hearing and balance disorders among men and women. Our long-term goal is to improve the health of people living with HIV and to help prevent those without HIV from seroconverting. NARRATIVE HIV is a treatable and preventable disease but there are individuals who have not benefited from therapies to control the virus, improve health, and decrease transmission. We hope to understand why this happens to certain individuals, and develop tools to improve HIV treatment and prevention.",Surviving the HIV Epidemic (S/HE) in metropolitan Washington DC - Advancing knowledge through cohort studies,10219623,U01HL146205,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Capital ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' District of Columbia ', ' D.C.
