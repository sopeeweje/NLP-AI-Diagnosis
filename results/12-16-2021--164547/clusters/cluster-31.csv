"Social Inequalities in Occupational Health and Health S*   The specific aim of this study is to determine whether there are        disparities in the occurrence of occupational injuries and illness and in            associated medical care for work-related disorders, based on workers' race           ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This exploratory study will advance the         NORA health services research mission by illuminating socially-based patterns        of disease occurrence and medical care delivery, and test a novel research           methodology that employs large national health care databases to collect and         analyze information about the health and health care experiences of injured          workers. The proposed investigation also directly applies to the NORA focus on       social and economic consequences, social disparities in the incidence of             work-related injuries and illness and inequalities in health care services are       potentially a significant social impact of workplace accidents that must be          considered when evaluating the overall human burden imposed on workers               suffering job injuries. The proposed study methodology is based on the use of        three national population-based surveys of patients and health care providers        containing information about patient sociodemographic attributes, employment         experiences and medical care services. Data sources include the National             Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, the National Longitudinal Study on Youth, and        the Health and Retirement Survey. Pilot studies conducted by this research team      have demonstrated the usefulness of these databases in providing an innovative       source of new information on this topic, and have provided initial evidence          suggesting that blacks and Hispanics, and those of low socioeconomic status are      more vulnerable to sustaining workplace injuries and receiving inferior medical      care. This study will result in a descriptive analysis of work-related cases         databases, and selected multivariate analyses to assess the interactive effect       of patient sociodemographic characteristics with employment experiences,             occupational health events, medical services, and vocational outcomes.                                                                                                    This study has significant policy implications related to the NORA health            services research objective of collecting new information about the                  determinants of health services for injured workers, and thereby helping to          eliminate barriers to securing appropriate care. Eliminating social disparities      in health is one of the two overarching national goals articulated in Health         People 2010 and the focus of President Clinton's and the Department of Health        and Human Service's recently announced national initiative: Eliminating Racial       and Ethnic Disparities in Health.

"HEALTH DISPARITIES AMONG HEALTHCARE WORKERS   DESCRIPTION (Taken from the Investigators' Abstract)                                                                                                                      Socioeconomic position (class, gender, and ethnicity) is inversely associated        with risk of morbidity and mortality due to various conditions.  Some of these       are not immediately life-threatening but have a major impact on health-related       quality of life, affecting the physical and social functional capacity of a          substantial proportion of the population.  These include musculoskeletal             disorders, various types of acute injury (both intentional and unintentional),       and mental health conditions.  All three of these have been associated with          environmental conditions in the workplace, which themselves show a marked            socioeconomic gradient because of widespread occupational segregation.  The          investigators propose to examine the work environment as a primary mediator of       the effect of socioeconomic position on population health.  The study will           involve a combination of quantitative and qualitative data and will support a        contextual analysis, set within a broader ecological and political theoretical       framework.  Multiple data sources will be used to evaluate job features, such        as physical load (e.g., heavy lifting), shift work, high psychological job           demands coupled with low decision autonomy, and threat of interpersonal              violence, as well as facility-wide characteristics such as adequacy of               staffing, management commitment to occupational health and safety programs,          and policies concerning gender and racial discrimination and sexual                  harassment.  Morbidity will be assessed by survey instrument as well as from         facility records of absenteeism, work-related injury and illness, and                compensation claims.  In a series of three panel surveys, the investigators          will seek to maximize the number of subjects responding more than once, to           permit longitudinal analysis.  An outcomes sub-study will sample employees           reporting health problems at baseline; additional information about their            health and employment status will be sought about two years later.  By               conducting the study in multiple facilities and job groups, it will be               possible to compare the effects of job- and individual-specific exposures as         well as the effect of different management policies and workplace climates           that have the potential to determine the magnitude and impact of hazardous           exposures.  The study will be conducted within the healthcare industry, which        employs a large proportion of the working population in Massachusetts (and           nationally) and is an increasingly important employer of minority workers.

"Race and outcomes in work-related back injuries Occupational low back injury, a significant economic and healthcare problem in the U.S., has proven difficult to manage consistently and cost-effectively.  Recent studies have shown medical management of low back pain to be highly variable.  With respect to Workers' Compensation, apparent disparities in assessment and treatment associated with race have also been identified.  While this research demonstrated potentially inequitable treatment of injured minorities with low back injuries, the representativeness of the results and their implications for post-settlement outcomes (i.e., clinical adjustment and employability) remain unknown.  This historical cohort study is designed to identify potential race-related disparities in occupational healthcare, define the scope of the problem, and to assess the impact of such disparities on post-settlement adjustment.  The study will examine a cohort of African Americans and White workers who incurred disabling low back injuries in the State of Missouri and whose disability claims were settled during the year 2001.  Records of the Missouri Division of Workers' Compensation (MODWC) will be used to identify those claims from three Missouri population centers (St. Louis City, St. Louis County, Jackson County), where the majority of African Americans in Missouri reside.  MODWC records will provide data relevant to medical costs, temporary total disability costs, permanent disability costs, and other injury-related matters for all claimants with work-related low back injuries leading to missed work time.  Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing methods will be used to assess post-settlement adjustment.  Regression models will be used to assess the relationship of race and legal representation, alone and in interaction, with Workers' Compensation outcomes and post-settlement adjustment of claimants.  The historical cohort design will address three weaknesses in the present state of knowledge.  First, it addresses potential associations between race, treatment, and disability outcomes, an area that has been neglected.  Second, it addresses relations among the above constructs and the post-settlement adjustment of claimants. Moreover, because of the sample size and the design, we will be able to separate the effects of potentially confounding variables (e.g., job type, socioeconomic status), both alone and in interaction with race.  Finally, by dint of the procedures needed to recruit participants, the study will establish a cohort of injured workers whose adjustment can be monitored not only at the time of this study, but potentially beyond that time frame.  If the cohort is examined at a later point in time, it will be possible to track true long-term outcomes of occupational healthcare.

"Methods/Diffusion Tensor MRI Studies/Spinal Cord Injury  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  This is an Exploratory/Developmental grant application whose goal is to advance diffusion tensor magnetic resonance (DT-MR) imaging studies of spinal cord injury. There is abundant evidence that the diffusion characteristics of the cord white matter reflect the presence and integrity of axons. In order to make reliable decisions concerning the abnormality of a measurement derived from the DT, the variation of that measurement must be properly characterized over both normal and afflicted populations. The proposed methods for registration and spatial normalization of DT data will enable quantitative characterizations of the variation of measurements over both selected population groups and single-subject longitudinal studies to assist disease diagnosis or treatment monitoring. In particular, the long-term aim is to determine those DTMR characteristics, which predict the severity of initial axonal damage, subsequent degeneration and the extent of regeneration in injured spinal cord. Specific aims for this proposal are as follows:1.To develop a method for non-rigid registration and spatial normalization of DT-MR images. There are two issues of concern when adapting existing registration algorithms to work with DT-MR data: first, we require a measure of image similarity to drive the registration process, and, second, we need to consider the effects of normalizing transformations on the voxel data in a DT image-DTs contain orientational information that must be handled appropriately when transformations are applied. The proposed project will investigate both of these issues.2.To characterize the DT-MR registration algorithm over synthetic data. We will use numerical phantoms, for which perfect ground truth data is readily available, to systematically evaluate the performance of the proposed registration method under different (a) noise levels, (b) spatial resolutions and (c) degrees of shape disparity.3.To validate the DT-MR registration algorithm over lamprey spinal cord data. We will validate the proposed method by registering DT-MR studies of lamprey spinal cord, imaged in different configurations. DT-MRIs of the lamprey spinal cord would be ideal for evaluating the developed method, since lamprey anatomy allows the spinal cord to undergo non-rigid transformations. Moreover, the lamprey cord contains a number of ""giant"" axons, which can be resolved by high resolution MR imaging. This permits direct observation of the distribution and course of the giant axons, with MR imaging, but independent of diffusion studies.

"Race and outcomes in work-related back injuries Occupational low back injury, a significant economic and healthcare problem in the U.S., has proven difficult to manage consistently and cost-effectively.  Recent studies have shown medical management of low back pain to be highly variable.  With respect to Workers' Compensation, apparent disparities in assessment and treatment associated with race have also been identified.  While this research demonstrated potentially inequitable treatment of injured minorities with low back injuries, the representativeness of the results and their implications for post-settlement outcomes (i.e., clinical adjustment and employability) remain unknown.  This historical cohort study is designed to identify potential race-related disparities in occupational healthcare, define the scope of the problem, and to assess the impact of such disparities on post-settlement adjustment.  The study will examine a cohort of African Americans and White workers who incurred disabling low back injuries in the State of Missouri and whose disability claims were settled during the year 2001.  Records of the Missouri Division of Workers' Compensation (MODWC) will be used to identify those claims from three Missouri population centers (St. Louis City, St. Louis County, Jackson County), where the majority of African Americans in Missouri reside.  MODWC records will provide data relevant to medical costs, temporary total disability costs, permanent disability costs, and other injury-related matters for all claimants with work-related low back injuries leading to missed work time.  Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing methods will be used to assess post-settlement adjustment.  Regression models will be used to assess the relationship of race and legal representation, alone and in interaction, with Workers' Compensation outcomes and post-settlement adjustment of claimants.  The historical cohort design will address three weaknesses in the present state of knowledge.  First, it addresses potential associations between race, treatment, and disability outcomes, an area that has been neglected.  Second, it addresses relations among the above constructs and the post-settlement adjustment of claimants. Moreover, because of the sample size and the design, we will be able to separate the effects of potentially confounding variables (e.g., job type, socioeconomic status), both alone and in interaction with race.  Finally, by dint of the procedures needed to recruit participants, the study will establish a cohort of injured workers whose adjustment can be monitored not only at the time of this study, but potentially beyond that time frame.  If the cohort is examined at a later point in time, it will be possible to track true long-term outcomes of occupational healthcare.

"Methods/Diffusion Tensor MRI Studies/Spinal Cord Injury  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  This is an Exploratory/Developmental grant application whose goal is to advance diffusion tensor magnetic resonance (DT-MR) imaging studies of spinal cord injury. There is abundant evidence that the diffusion characteristics of the cord white matter reflect the presence and integrity of axons. In order to make reliable decisions concerning the abnormality of a measurement derived from the DT, the variation of that measurement must be properly characterized over both normal and afflicted populations. The proposed methods for registration and spatial normalization of DT data will enable quantitative characterizations of the variation of measurements over both selected population groups and single-subject longitudinal studies to assist disease diagnosis or treatment monitoring. In particular, the long-term aim is to determine those DTMR characteristics, which predict the severity of initial axonal damage, subsequent degeneration and the extent of regeneration in injured spinal cord. Specific aims for this proposal are as follows:1.To develop a method for non-rigid registration and spatial normalization of DT-MR images. There are two issues of concern when adapting existing registration algorithms to work with DT-MR data: first, we require a measure of image similarity to drive the registration process, and, second, we need to consider the effects of normalizing transformations on the voxel data in a DT image-DTs contain orientational information that must be handled appropriately when transformations are applied. The proposed project will investigate both of these issues.2.To characterize the DT-MR registration algorithm over synthetic data. We will use numerical phantoms, for which perfect ground truth data is readily available, to systematically evaluate the performance of the proposed registration method under different (a) noise levels, (b) spatial resolutions and (c) degrees of shape disparity.3.To validate the DT-MR registration algorithm over lamprey spinal cord data. We will validate the proposed method by registering DT-MR studies of lamprey spinal cord, imaged in different configurations. DT-MRIs of the lamprey spinal cord would be ideal for evaluating the developed method, since lamprey anatomy allows the spinal cord to undergo non-rigid transformations. Moreover, the lamprey cord contains a number of ""giant"" axons, which can be resolved by high resolution MR imaging. This permits direct observation of the distribution and course of the giant axons, with MR imaging, but independent of diffusion studies. Thus, this direct observation offers a method to test registration accuracy without resorting to maneuvers such as histological study of the cord, which might distort the anatomy.

"IDENTIFYING FEMALE ATHLETES AT HIGH RISK FOR ACL INJURY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is now widely recognized that gender-based differences can play a major role in the predisposition to disease and injury, yet this remains an understudied phenomenon. Adolescent females who participate in jumping and pivoting sports suffer anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury at a 4 to 6-fold greater rate than adolescent males participating in the same sports. The reason(s) for this ACL injury disparity remain(s) obscure. Prior to puberty, male and female injury risk appears equal. Our long-term objectives are to determine how female athletes become more susceptible to non-contact ACL injury, prospectively identify those female athletes who are more susceptible to injury and to determine the underlying mechanistic cause(s) of increased risk at the biomechanical and biochemical levels and to optimize the effectiveness of treatments designed to prevent ACL injuries. Towards these goals, we propose to test the central hypothesis that the increases in lower extremity bone length and body mass that occur during puberty, without the neuromuscular performance spurt that most males demonstrate, will increase dynamic valgus, knee joint loading and injury risk in a subset of female athletes. It will also test the hypothesis that measures relating to dynamic valgus will prove predictive of ACL injury risk in high-risk female athletes. Specific Aim 1 will determine if following the onset of pubertal growth, increases in tibia and femur length and body mass, in the absence of increases in strength and recruitment of the musculature at the hip and knee that controls knee position and load, will lead to decreased neuromuscular control as measured by increased dynamic valgus in a subset of maturing female athletes. Specific Aim 2 will determine if objective biomechanical measures can predict relative ACL injury risk in female athletes. We hypothesize that a model that incorporates measures of dynamic valgus and variables that contribute to neuromuscular control of valgus (hip adduction moment) and increased knee joint load (knee abduction moment) will prove both sensitive and specific predictors of ACL injury risk in female athletes. These data should provide a foundation for approaching both the mechanistic questions underlying risk disparity, as well as increase our ability to direct high-risk athletes to effective, targeted interventions, which are proposed. Prevention of female rates from 5 times to equal males' would allow >30,000 females annually to continue the benefits of sports participation and to avoid the long-term complications of osteoarthritis, which may occur with a 10-fold greater incidence in the ACL-injured population.

"Cooperative Perinatal Studies and Interventions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes the Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC) plan for Phase Ill - NIH-DC Initiative (NIH-DCI) to Reduce Infant Mortality in Minority Populations. GUMC proposes two community based intervention projects to be conducted sequentially over the five year study period. Project 1 is a Teen Mothers Project to increase interpartum intervals. The specific aims for Project 1are to: 1) conduct a community based intervention for teen mothers aimed at increasing interpartum intervals; and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention as compared to controls in increasing interpartum intervals, and promoting healthy reproductive practices, healthy relationships, school attendance and employment. Project 2 is an Unintentional Injury Prevention Project for Children of Families at risk. The specific aims for Project 2 are to: 1) conduct three community-based interventions (home-based intervention, Child Safety Room, educational materials) aimed at reducing injuries among children under age 5 years; and 2) evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing unintentional injury, and increasing parental knowledge, self-efficacy and practice of safety strategies. The interdisciplinary research team draws from multiple divisions of GUMC and collaborators within the NIH-DCI (GWU, HUH, CNMC). The projects build on previously developed cooperative relationships with community health care sites within DC that serve minority populations. We also propose a new partnership with a public-private neighborhood collaborative. The GUMC team offers scientific expertise in perinatal health, adolescent medicine, child development, health risk behavior, injury prevention and public health interventions. Our team has an outstanding record of success in working together to advance knowledge of health disparities and improve outcomes for minority populations.

Specific Aim 1 will determine if following the onset of pubertal growth, increases in tibia and femur length and body mass, in the absence of increases in strength and recruitment of the musculature at the hip and knee that controls knee position and load, will lead to decreased neuromuscular control as measured by increased dynamic valgus in a subset of maturing female athletes. Specific Aim 2 will determine if objective biomechanical measures can predict relative ACL injury risk in female athletes. We hypothesize that a model that incorporates measures of dynamic valgus and variables that contribute to neuromuscular control of valgus (hip adduction moment) and increased knee joint load (knee abduction moment) will prove both sensitive and specific predictors of ACL injury risk in female athletes. These data should provide a foundation for approaching both the mechanistic questions underlying risk disparity, as well as increase our ability to direct high-risk athletes to effective, targeted interventions, which are proposed. Prevention of female rates from 5 times to equal males' would allow >30,000 females annually to continue the benefits of sports participation and to avoid the long-term complications of osteoarthritis, which may occur with a 10-fold greater incidence in the ACL-injured population.

"IDENTIFYING FEMALE ATHLETES AT HIGH RISK FOR ACL INJURY    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is now widely recognized that gender-based differences can play a major role in the predisposition to disease and injury, yet this remains an understudied phenomenon. Adolescent females who participate in pivoting and jumping sports suffer anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury at a 4 to 6-fold greater rate than adolescent males participating in the same sports. Since the passage of Title IX of The Educational Assistance Act, male participation at the high school level has increased less than 3 percent (from 3.7 to 3.8 million), while female participation has increased 800 percent, roughly doubling every 10 years (from 0.3 to 2.7 million). This geometric growth in participation, coupled with the 4 to 6-fold higher injury rate, has been accompanied by an alarming increase in the number of ACL injuries in female athletes. The reason(s) for this ACL injury disparity remain(s) obscure. Prior to puberty, male and female injury risk is more or less equal. Our long-term objectives are to determine how female athletes become more susceptible to non-contact ACL injury, prospectively identify those female athletes who are more susceptible to injury and to determine the underlying mechanistic cause(s) of increased risk at the biomechanical and biochemical levels. Towards these goals, we propose to test the central hypothesis that the biomechanical changes that accompany puberty, including increased height, body segment length and weight, in the absence of the neuromuscular performance spurt that males demonstrate during puberty may lead to biomechanical-neuromuscular imbalances that result in poor dynamic knee stability and high knee injury risk in many female athletes. SPECIFIC AIM 1 will determine if the biomechanical changes that accompany puberty underlie the decreased dynamic knee stability in female athletes. SPECIFIC AIM 2 will determine if specific neuromuscular measures of dynamic knee stability can predict ACL injury risk. These data should provide a foundation for approaching both the mechanistic questions underlying risk disparity, as well as increasing our ability to direct high-risk athletes into appropriate neuromuscular training programs         ",IDENTIFYING FEMALE ATHLETES AT HIGH RISK FOR ACL INJURY,7074482,R01AR049735,[''],NIAMS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2005,25454,0.18399945122895192
"Reducing Health Disparities in the Sexual Assault Exam Using Fluorescence Imaging  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexual assault and rape are known as the silent, violent epidemic because they  lead to an estimated 2.6 million injuries to females each year, but women often do not report the assault or seek treatment. Strategies that improve the sensitivity of the forensic exam are known to increase reporting rates and increase the number of women who seek health care. This SBIR submission is the result of collaboration between a small business (Brenden Creative Consultants LLC), and a team of scientists at the University of Cincinnati and the Skin Science Institute at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. The long term objective of this R&D proposal is to develop innovative techniques with commercial application to detect skin injury across the continuum of skin color. These applications ultimately will lead to products used for a forensic examination with a high sensitivity to predict rape. The short term objective is to explore innovative techniques that would improve the quantification, sensitivity, and reliability of skin injury detection in the forensic rape examination. This investigation is critical because the team has compelling evidence that health disparities in the forensic examination place women of color at a disadvantage. Racial/ ethnic differences in injury prevalence are likely explained by variation in genital injury visibility due to skin color. If injuries in Black/African American women are not detected they have a lower standard of health care, and have less success in the criminal justice system than their White couterparts. The R&D aspects of the proposal will give rise to a hardware system with accompanying software that will allow for improved injury visualization regardless of skin color through staining procedures, digital image capture, and digital image processing. In the Phase I portion of the SBIR, we propose to: 1) determine the utility of the flourescence imaging techniques as a method for detecting and quantifying epidermal injury in females; 2) compare the area and intensity of epidermal injury on a forearm model in females of different racial or ethnic identites; and 3) determine the feasibility of using the flourescence imaging technique and digital imaging processing as methods for detecting and quantifying mucosal injury in females of light and dark skin color. The demand for cost effective and yet sensitive applications to aid injury detection is growing.

"Racial Disparity in Access to Trauma Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Racial disparities in access to appropriate, high quality health care have been extensively documented and are believed to contribute to substantially lower life expectancy in the African-American compared to the white population in the United States. The third leading contributor to black-white disparities in mortality as measured in potential life-years lost is death due to injury. However, the influence of race on access to care for injury has received only limited scrutiny. The goal of the proposed research is to understand the influence of race on quality of care for injured patients, as reflected in structure, process and outcomes of hospital care for injuries. Nationally representative hospital claims data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, hospital characteristics from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey and community characteristics from the Area Resources File will be analyzed to address three specific Aims:  Specific Aim 1: To determine whether there are differences in the structural aspects of healthcare delivery for racial/ethnic minority patients versus white injured patients, as reflected by characteristics of the hospitals to which they are admitted and the availability of trauma resources in their communities.  Specific Aim 2: To identify whether there are differences in processes of care delivered to racial/ethnic minority patients during hospitalization after injury, particularly among subsets of injured patients for whom specific procedures are expected to be delivered.   Specific Aim 3: To examine whether differences by race in hospital characteristics and processes of care are predictive of previously identified disparities in outcome after injury. The proposed research represents an important first step in addressing the contribution of injuries to racial disparities in health and mortality. Previous research has indicated the presence of a racial disparity in mortality after injury, but has not addressed several questions which must be ansared before interventions can be designed to close the gap. These questions, addressed by the specific Aims above, begin to identify where the healthcare system may be failing injured racial/ethnic minority patients.             ",Racial Disparity in Access to Trauma Care,7613592,R03HS015737,"['emergency care ', ' hospital patient care ', ' health care service availability ', ' trauma ', ' African American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA FAIRBANKS,R03,2006,48025,0.15459618062972336

"Health Literacy and Child Prevention Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Injury is the leading cause of death for children and thousands of nonfatal injuries are treated in emergency departments every year. Children living in low income urban environments are at especially high risk for preventable injuries. There is promising evidence that pediatric emergency departments can provide an important opportunity for providing injury prevention counseling. We are currently completing an NICHD- funded intervention trial of a culturally tailored, computer kiosk intervention promoting child safety in the Johns Hopkins Pediatric Emergency Department (FED). The families served in this FED are from a low income, urban, predominantly African American population. Preliminary data using the REALM was collected in the RED to inform the development of our intervention. Among 59 parents, 28 percent read below the 9th grade level, and 14 percent at or below the 6th grade level. We have continued to collect REALM data from parents enrolled in the intervention trial, although questions about literacy were not included in the original study aims. Parents (or legal guardians) of young children are being enrolled and randomly assigned to receive the culturally tailored, personalized child safety feedback report or a non-tailored child health feedback report. Outcome assessments of parents' safety knowledge and behaviors will be assessed at two follow-up points by interview with a random sample selected for home observations to confirm self-reported safety practices. This proposed RO3 research is a revised application. The aims are to: 1) assess the prevalence of low health literacy among a large sample of inner city parents of young children seen in a pediatric emergency department; 2) examine the relationship between low health literacy in parents and child injury related outcomes, including knowledge of safety information and adoption of safety behaviors; and 3) examine whether and to what extent low income parents' literacy levels moderate the impact of a culturally tailored computer kiosk intervention on comprehension of safety information and adoption of safety behaviors. Results from this study can be used to: 1) suggest ways in which FED prevention interventions for low literacy populations can be strengthened, and 2) prepare an RO1 application to extend our program of research on adult literacy and child health and safety. We believe communication strategies that effectively incorporate issues of culture and literacy can help reduce the disparities in child injury experiences, although virtually no scholarly work has been undertaken on this topic. We propose to efficiently begin addressing this gap by conducting an innovative secondary data analysis, the results of which will be immediately useful to prevention programs and will form the basis for future research on literacy and child health and safety.           ",Health Literacy and Child Prevention Injury,7135926,R03HD050501,"['pediatrics ', ' computer center ', ' computer assisted instruction ', ' health education ', ' educationally disadvantaged ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' emergency care ', ' injury prevention ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' health behavior ', ' behavior modification ', ' awareness ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' urban poverty area ', ' culture ', ' human therapy evaluation ', ' human data ', ' interactive multimedia ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' outcomes research ', ' patient oriented research ', ' children ', ' health disparity ', ' early /brief intervention /therapy ', ' ']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2006,81792,0.041249115640182285

"Birth, Muscle Injury and Pelvic Floor Dysfunction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks to improve care for the women who suffer the priority health conditions of pelvic floor dysfunction; problems that arise due to women's unique role in giving birth. It addresses the sex disparities that exist in these problems. Each year 3 million women deliver babies and 300,000 women need surgery for pelvic floor dysfunction. A lack of basic understanding of the mechanisms of birth-related injury and recovery during reproductive years and mechanisms of prolapse later in life block efforts to prevent damage, improve recovery, or improve treatment. We seek continued support for a broadly interdisciplinary group of researchers from 4 schools and 2 institutes to that has expedited development of new knowledge needed to improve treatment and prevention. Project 1: ""Birth Biomechanics"" will test hypotheses concerning basic mechanisms of pelvic floor injury during vaginal birth; the single largest factor in causing pelvic floor dysfunction to identify specific situations may increase or decrease injury risk. Project 2: ""Injury Recovery"" will identify risk factors associated with levator injury, test the hypothesis that these injuries are, in fact, related to vaginal delivery and determine early predictors of eventual recovery. Project 3, ""Mechanisms of Posterior Vaginal Prolapse"" will use advanced imaging and deformation analysis to test hypotheses concerning the basic disease mechanisms responsible for posterior vaginal wall prolapse, one of the most common and strongly birth-associated pelvic floor dysfunction.  Core A: Administrative / Human Subjects / Biostatistics core provides project support by recruiting subjects, compiling and analyzing data and protecting subject safety. In Core A, two study groups will be formed concerning 1) Gender Impact and 2) Basic Science Futures to discuss expanding the issues raised by this research.

"IDENTIFYING FEMALE ATHLETES AT HIGH RISK FOR ACL INJURY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is now widely recognized that gender-based differences can play a major role in the predisposition to disease and injury, yet this remains an understudied phenomenon. Adolescent females who participate in jumping and pivoting sports suffer anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury at a 4 to 6-fold greater rate than adolescent males participating in the same sports. The reason(s) for this ACL injury disparity remain(s) obscure. Prior to puberty, male and female injury risk appears equal. Our long-term objectives are to determine how female athletes become more susceptible to non-contact ACL injury, prospectively identify those female athletes who are more susceptible to injury and to determine the underlying mechanistic cause(s) of increased risk at the biomechanical and biochemical levels and to optimize the effectiveness of treatments designed to prevent ACL injuries. Towards these goals, we propose to test the central hypothesis that the increases in lower extremity bone length and body mass that occur during puberty, without the neuromuscular performance spurt that most males demonstrate, will increase dynamic valgus, knee joint loading and injury risk in a subset of female athletes. It will also test the hypothesis that measures relating to dynamic valgus will prove predictive of ACL injury risk in high-risk female athletes. Specific Aim 1 will determine if following the onset of pubertal growth, increases in tibia and femur length and body mass, in the absence of increases in strength and recruitment of the musculature at the hip and knee that controls knee position and load, will lead to decreased neuromuscular control as measured by increased dynamic valgus in a subset of maturing female athletes. Specific Aim 2 will determine if objective biomechanical measures can predict relative ACL injury risk in female athletes. We hypothesize that a model that incorporates measures of dynamic valgus and variables that contribute to neuromuscular control of valgus (hip adduction moment) and increased knee joint load (knee abduction moment) will prove both sensitive and specific predictors of ACL injury risk in female athletes. These data should provide a foundation for approaching both the mechanistic questions underlying risk disparity, as well as increase our ability to direct high-risk athletes to effective, targeted interventions, which are proposed. Prevention of female rates from 5 times to equal males' would allow >30,000 females annually to continue the benefits of sports participation and to avoid the long-term complications of osteoarthritis, which may occur with a 10-fold greater incidence in the ACL-injured population.

"Injury from Sexual Assault: Addressing Health Disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sexual assault is a silent, violent epidemic that physically injures an estimated 2.6 million females in the U.S. ach year; 800,000 females will receive some type of health care as a result of their injuries. This competing continuation application builds on the unexpected finding that significantly fewer ano-genital injuries occurred n Black/African American women than in White/Caucasian women following both consensual and non- consensual sexual intercourse. We believe these differences can be explained by variation in visibility of injury due to skin color. If differences in visibility lead to lower observed prevalence of injury in women with dark skin, they are at a disadvantage within the healthcare and legal systems because their injuries are not treated and prosecutors are less likely to file charges. The objectives include determining: 1) if women after non-consensual sexual assault have a significantly greater prevalence, frequency, and severity of intercourse-related ano-genital injuries than women after consensual sexual intercourse; 2) if intercourse- related injuries are less likely to be identified in women of race/ethnicities with darker skin color after adjusting for biometrically-derived measures of skin color; and 3) if there is a constellation of injury types (Tears, Ecchymoses, Abrasions, Redness, Swelling, or TEARS) and severities within specific anatomical locations that best discriminates victims of sexual assault from women who have had consensual intercourse; and to create 4) an injury map and genital injury severity scale (GISS) that are empirically- derived tools that can be used by clinicians to evaluate lack of consent. We will prospectively enroll 400 Consensual Control, ethnically/racially diverse participants who will undergo a forensic exam and digital imaging following consensual sex. Data derived from the exam will be compared to data from a retrospective review of forensic records and digital images from 400 matched Non-consensual Sexual Assault Survivors. Results of refined biometric imaging techniques will allow us to: 1) create a genital injury severity scale (GISS); 2) empirically test the association between skin colorimetric variables and ano-genital injury prevalence, frequency, and severity within each study group; 3) compare Consensual and Non-consensual Groups in terms of their injury-related characteristics, controlling for skin color variables; 4) predict or differentiate Consensual versus Non-consensual Group membership using modern classification statistics; and 5) construct a predictive Injury Map with clinical utility based on the results of classification analyses. Public Health Relevance: Violence against women is a silent epidemic. The forensic exam used to collect evidence after rape needs to be equally sensitive for females with dark skin as well as females with light skin.                    ",Injury from Sexual Assault: Addressing Health Disparity,7258287,R01NR005352,"['Crime ', ' Skin ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Legal ', ' Ecchymosis ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Female ', ' Forensic Medicine ', ' Forensics ', ' Future ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Healed ', ' Penetration ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Visual ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' sexual assault ', ' sexual attack ', ' assaulted sexually ', ' Numbers ', ' Measurement ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Maps ', ' Melanins ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Redness ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Forcible intercourse ', ' Rape ', ' instrument ', ' Records ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Appendix ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Victimization ', ' Spectrophotometry ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Swelling ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tolonium chloride ', ' Toluidine Blue O ', ' Toluidine Blue ', ' Phenothiazin-5-ium, 3-amino-7-(dimethylamino)-2-methyl-, chloride ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Score ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Genital system ', ' urogenital system (genital part) ', ' Genital ', ' Genital injury ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Black race ', ' digital imaging ', ' computer imaging ', ' experience ', ' skin color ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Legal system ', ' social ', ' physical assault ', ' physical attack ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Count ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Charge ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Coercion ', ' Coitus ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Accounting ', ' Color ', ' Colposcopy ', ' healing ', ' injured ', ' violence against women ', ' digital ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Confidence Intervals ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2007,608581,0.21213300996566356
"Cooperative Perinatal Studies and Interventions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes the Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC) plan for Phase Ill - NIH-DC Initiative (NIH-DCI) to Reduce Infant Mortality in Minority Populations. GUMC proposes two community based intervention projects to be conducted sequentially over the five year study period. Project 1 is a Teen Mothers Project to increase interpartum intervals. The specific aims for Project 1are to: 1) conduct a community based intervention for teen mothers aimed at increasing interpartum intervals; and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention as compared to controls in increasing interpartum intervals, and promoting healthy reproductive practices, healthy relationships, school attendance and employment. Project 2 is an Unintentional Injury Prevention Project for Children of Families at risk. The specific aims for Project 2 are to: 1) conduct three community-based interventions (home-based intervention, Child Safety Room, educational materials) aimed at reducing injuries among children under age 5 years; and 2) evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing unintentional injury, and increasing parental knowledge, self-efficacy and practice of safety strategies. The interdisciplinary research team draws from multiple divisions of GUMC and collaborators within the NIH-DCI (GWU, HUH, CNMC). The projects build on previously developed cooperative relationships with community health care sites within DC that serve minority populations. We also propose a new partnership with a public-private neighborhood collaborative. The GUMC team offers scientific expertise in perinatal health, adolescent medicine, child development, health risk behavior, injury prevention and public health interventions. Our team has an outstanding record of success in working together to advance knowledge of health disparities and improve outcomes for minority populations. Members of GUMC will continue to disseminate research findings from Phase 2 and collaborate on BFY and Alcohol Assessment in Minority Women.

"Intimate Partner Violence: Community Health Centers Take Action    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Annually in the US, intimate partner violence (IPV) is responsible for 40 to 50 percent of all murders of women, approximately 1,300 deaths, (CDC, 2003). In Hawaii, between 1995 and 2004 there were 57 murders of women from IPV (Hi. St. Dept. of A. G., 2005). Annually 5.3 million IPV victimizations occur among women. Nearly 2 million injuries result with 550,000 requiring medical attention (CDC, 2003). Significant health and social consequences are related to IPV and include acute and long-term psychological, physical, social and economic effects (Draucker, 2002). The costs of IPV in direct medical and mental health care services exceed $4 billion each year (Max, Rice, Golding, & Pinderhughes, 1999). Differences between cultural perspectives may lead to barriers that prevent women from receiving effective care (Campbell & Fishwick, 1993). Campbell and Campbell (1996) suggest that clinical interventions for abused women should be based on principles that include cultural competence and empowerment. Consistent with the need to develop culturally appropriate approaches to address IPV, and the previous research of this team, the purpose of this study is to understand how IPV and culture come together for selected cultural groups. The specific aims of the study are to examine the following: cultural perceptions, responses and needs regarding IPV; perceptions of the acceptability of violence; reasons women may or may not disclose IPV, and perceptions of the influence of specific elements of culture regarding IPV. The theoretical foundation for this study is Critical Social Theory (CST), a post-modern philosophical perspective that acknowledges that some voices are privileged and others are marginalized (Boudreau, 1997). The use of the community based participatory research (CBPR) approach to this study is consistent with the perspective of CST. An expected outcome of CBPR is the attainment of new knowledge that guides actions. This investigation is a descriptive study using both quantitative and qualitative methods. It will be conducted over a two year period in two phases: 1) Individual Interviews; and 2) Focus Groups. Women, 18 years and older, will be recruited through a variety of programs that are affiliated with the three participating CHCs. Data will be collected between the 4th-15th months. Analysis of qualitative data will be accomplished using content analysis (Downe-Wamboldt, 1992). Quantitative data will be analyzed using descriptive methods: frequencies; means; and standard deviations. Data from both qualitative and quantitative findings will be integrated to better understand individual and group perceptions of IPV. Comparisons will be made across the 3 cultural groups. Findings will be used to develop culturally appropriate IPV screening and interventions. This study is consistent with the priorities of NINR, and is a form of health promotion and injury prevention (IPV) research using a multidisciplinary approach to improve the general health of underserved minority women (NINR, 2006). This study is a form of health promotion and injury prevention research to improve the general health of underserved minority women. The long term goal of this program of research is to develop culturally appropriate interventions consistent with the National Institute for Nursing Research (NINR's) priorities and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) agenda (CDC, 2002). The agenda pinpoints seven areas, including IPV, where additional research can have the greatest impact on preventing injuries and controlling their debilitating effects. The study is also consistent with the goals of Healthy People 2010, increasing quality of life and eliminating health disparities. Injury and violence is also considered a leading health indicator for the implementation of Healthy People 2010 (U.S. DHHS, 2000).             ",Intimate Partner Violence: Community Health Centers Take Action,7253063,R15NR009424,"['psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Domestic Violence ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' sexual assault ', ' sexual attack ', ' assaulted sexually ', ' Individual ', ' Filipino ', ' satisfaction ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Battered Women ', ' abuse of women ', ' abuse of females ', ' Abused women ', ' Abused females ', ' Funding ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Mosses ', ' Bryophyte ', ' Bryophyta ', ' Perception ', ' tool ', ' Hawaiian population ', ' Hawaiian ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Forcible intercourse ', ' Rape ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Rice ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' United States ', ' Attention ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Voice ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Complex ', ' Awareness ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Behavior ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' social ', ' emotional abuse ', ' mental abuse ', ' Psychological abuse ', ' physical assault ', ' physical attack ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Competence ', ' Lawyers ', ' Attorneys ', ' Murder ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' Violent injury ', ' Violence injury ', ' Outcome ', ' 18 year old ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' community based participatory research ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Purpose ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Economics ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' violence prevention ', ' prevent violence ', ' Caring ', ' injury prevention ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Rate ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Hawaii ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Homicide ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,R15,2007,207600,0.09059789902250563
"Colorado Injury Control Research Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The purpose of the Colorado Injury Control Research Center (CICRC) is to participate with communities to reduce injuries, primarily in Public Health Service (PHS) Region VIII.  Core values that govern the activities at the CICRC are:  a primary focus on reducing disparities in the prevention and control of injuries; seeking collaborative relationships with communities; innovation in education/training, community programs and   research; and identification of evidence-based, efficient approaches to prevent of injuries.  The CICRC is located in PHS Region VIII. PHS Region VIII includes Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, Utah and North Dakota. In the region, 23.2% of the population is rural non-farm, and 2.3% are rural farm residents. The population density of each state in the region is significantly lower than the US as a whole; these population densities have important implications for the development of appropriate injury prevention and control strategies in the region.  Death rates from all injuries are higher than US rates in all the states except North Dakota; unintentional injury death rates are higher than US rates in all states except Utah; motor vehicle occupant death rates are higher than US rates in all states except Colorado and Utah; and suicide death rates are higher than US rates in all states in the region.        The specific aims of the CICRC are to: 1) maintain an organizational structure to ensure effective coordination of the CICRC; 2) promote training and education related to injuries and control of injuries; 3) expand existing community based activities in injury control and prevention; 4) utilize existing data to identify injury patterns; 5) increase and diversify funding sources for injury research, community-based programs, education and training; 6)   disseminate information about injury prevention and control; 7) conduct ongoing of the CICRC program; 8) promote the development of new investigators in injury prevention and control research; and 9) conduct high quality, innovative research in acute care, prevention/control, and rehabilitation of injuries.  Public Health Relevance:  The purpose of the center is to reduce the occurrence, severity, and adverse consequences of injuries through research, education, and service.  Emphasis is placed on reducing disparities in injury outcomes through focusing on community partnerships among underserved populations, such as Native Americans, Hispanics and rural residents.          ",Colorado Injury Control Research Center,7283370,R49CE001168,[''],NCIPC,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R49,2007,884841,0.24729928849146565
"A Community-Based Trial to Prevent Lead Poisoning and Injuries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The contribution of residential hazards to children's health is poorly defined, but it is clear that some of the most prevalent disease and disabilities among U.S. children - including injuries and lead poisoning - would decline if such hazards were eliminated. Residential hazards also contribute to social disparities in children's health. This revised community-based participatory research application - a partnership of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital and the National tenter for Healthy Housing - would extend the follow-up of an ongoing 402-person birth cohort (n=358 in the randomized trial) designed to test the efficacy of interventions to control residential hazards in children, from 2 years of age through 5 years. This extension is critical to fully evaluate the efficacy of reducing lead and injury hazards on children's intellectual abilities, behavioral problems and injuries during the peak vulnerability of early childhood. The central hypothesis of this application is that housing interventions will reduce the prevalence of lead toxicity and residential injuries in a racially diverse sample of children. The aims and hypotheses of this application are: 1.0 Determine the efficacy of lead hazard controls on children's blood lead levels and their risk for learning and behavioral problems. 1.1 Levels of lead in dust, soil and water will be significantly lower for housing units in the lead treatment arm compared with the injury control arm at 36, 48 and 60 month home visits. 1.2 Children who are assigned to the lead treatment arm will have lifetime blood lead levels that are >20% lower than children assigned to the injury treatment arm at 5 years. 1.3 Children in the lead treatment arm will have higher IQ scores at 5 years than children in the injury treatment arm. 1.4 Children in the lead treatment arm will have fewer behavioral problems at 5 years, especially measures related to ADHD, than children in the injury treatment arm. 1.5 Higher lead exposure, measured during pregnancy and early childhood using maternal blood, cord blood, meconium and children's blood, is inversely associated with IQ scores and directly associated with behavioral problems at 5 years in children with postnatal maximal blood lead levels < 5 /jg/dL 2.0 Determine the efficacy of comprehensive housing modifications on children's risk for injuries. 2.1 Children who are assigned to a multifactorial, housing intervention to prevent injuries will have 30% fewer unscheduled medical visits for housing injuries compared with children in the lead treatment arm. This is the first trial to test the efficacy of a multifactorial intervention for the primary prevention of two of the most prevalent causes of disease and disability in US children - lead toxicity and residential injuries. If efficacious, policy could be developed to reduce disease and disability linked with these hazards. It would also help resolve the ongoing controversy about the adverse consequences of low-level lead toxicity at blood lead levels previously thought to be safe. Our partnership with the National Center for Healthy Housing will enhance our ability to translate and disseminate the research results to affected communities locally and nationally.             ",A Community-Based Trial to Prevent Lead Poisoning and Injuries,7234588,R01ES014575,"['Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Purpose ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' motor vehicle injury ', ' injury from motor vehicle accident ', ' injury from car accident ', ' injury due to car accident ', ' car injury ', ' car accident injury ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Dust ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Modification ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Family ', ' Umbilical Cord Blood ', ' fetal cord blood ', ' Cord Blood ', ' Affect ', ' Injury ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' criminal behavior ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' House Call ', ' Home Visits ', ' Housing ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Hazard Controls ', ' Link ', ' Language ', ' disability ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead Poisoning ', ' toxicity to lead ', ' toxic effect to lead ', ' plumbism ', ' lead toxicity ', ' lead toxic effect ', ' Pb2+ toxic effect ', ' Pb2+ poisoning ', ' Pb2+ lead toxicity ', ' Pb2+ Toxicity ', ' Pb toxic effect ', ' Pb poisoning ', ' Pb lead toxicity ', ' Learning ', ' African ', ' Policies ', ' Americas ', ' Meconium ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Collaborations ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Soil ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Attention ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Week ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' postnatal ', ' Upper arm ', ' Score ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' hazard ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Impulsivity ', ' blood lead ', ' blood Pb ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Home visitation ', ' home visit ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Childhood Injury ', ' injury in children ', ' lead exposure ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' blood Pb concentration ', ' blood lead concentration ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Prevalence ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NIEHS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2007,622929,0.2034883002574588
"Disparities in Pediatric Trauma Outcomes: Context, Access and Quality of Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Injury is the number one cause of death for children. Although it is known that underprivileged children have an increased trauma mortality, there is a significant gap in our knowledge about the role access to quality trauma care plays in disparate outcomes for injured children. Whether the higher mortality rate is caused by an increased incidence of severe injury or an increased death rate for a given injury (severity- adjusted mortality) is important because each require different healthcare delivery and policy interventions. If underprivileged children have higher severity of injury and more lethal mechanisms of injury this would call for programs focused on environmental and behavioral modification. However if children also die because of lack of access to quality trauma care, this implies the institutionalization of inequitable care. An under- standing of the forces that influence trauma access, as well as an assessment of the quality of care provided, are vital to improving outcomes for children with trauma and will allow providers and policy makers to target trauma prevention strategies and implement system changes that will improve overall outcomes. While it is known that specialized trauma care improves outcomes, a significant proportion of severely injured persons are cared for outside the trauma system, thus a population-based analysis is necessary. We will use 1990-2006 California Vital Statistics death certificate data, and California Office of Statewide Planning and Development Patient Discharge Database records to identify all injured children admitted to California hospitals or who died prior to hospitalization. We will first determine if socioeconomic status is associated with an increased rate of out of hospital death, increased hospitalization rate for a given injury (controlling for severity), or increased severity-adjusted mortality. We will develop a robust mortality prediction model for injured children using patient level variables which will allow us to assess the association of system level variables such as rural status, and hospital volume on risk adjusted mortality. We will also identify predictors of trauma care access for children. This research foundation will allow for exploratory analysis of county trauma registries to identify quality of care indicators for pediatric trauma care and to determine to what degree outcome disparities are associated with poorer quality of care. My long-term career goal is to translate my clinical experience into scientifically sound epidemiological studies that will directly benefit all children. In addition to completion of this research, this award will allow me to obtain an MPH and broaden my quantitative skills. After this award period, I will continue as an independent investigator to identify disparities in pediatric trauma outcomes, improve the quality of emergency medical care and design community, regional and state-wide system interventions to prevent pediatric trauma, reduce outcome disparities and improve the overall quality of care provided to injured children.           ","Disparities in Pediatric Trauma Outcomes: Context, Access and Quality of Care",7322159,K23HD051595,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Death Certificates ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Provider ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Purpose ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Planning ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' County Hospitals ', ' Rural Hospitals ', ' Depth ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Ensure ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Numbers ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Condition ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' trauma centers ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Severities ', ' Side ', ' Award ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Location ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Quality Indicator ', ' experience ', ' Risk Adjustment ', ' Calibration ', ' California ', ' skills ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Disease regression ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' childhood trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' injured ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' Trauma Research ', ' ']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2007,129991,0.12586673885973085
"Cooperative Perinatal Studies and Interventions This proposal describes the Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC) plan for Phase Ill - NIH-DC Initiative (NIH-DCI) to Reduce Infant Mortality in Minority Populations. GUMC proposes two community based intervention projects to be conducted sequentially over the five year study period. Project I is a Teen Mothers Project to increase interpartum intervals. The specific aims for Project 1are to: 1) conduct a community based intervention for teen mothers aimed at increasing interpartum intervals; and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention as compared to controls in increasing interpartum intervals, and promoting healthy reproductive practices, healthy relationships, school attendance and employment. Project 2 is an Unintentional Injury Prevention Project for Children of Families at risk. The specific aims for Project 2 are to: 1) conduct three community-based interventions (home-based intervention, Child Safety Room, educational materials) aimed at reducing injuries among children under age 5 years; and 2) evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing unintentional injury, and increasing parental knowledge, self-efficacy and practice of safety strategies. The interdisciplinary research team draws from multiple divisions of GUMC and collaborators within the NIH-DCI (GWU, HUH, CNMC). The projects build on previously developed cooperative relationships with community health care sites within DC that serve minority populations. We also propose a new partnership with a public-private neighborhood collaborative. The GUMC team offers scientific expertise in perinatal health, adolescent medicine, child development, health risk behavior, injury prevention and public health interventions. Our team has an outstanding record of success in working together to advance knowledge of health disparities and improve outcomes for minority  populations.

"Skin Elasticity and Skin Color: Understanding Health Disparity in Sexual Assault    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexual assault is a violent event that affects millions of females each year. Of the estimated 6.8 million rapes and physical assaults annually in the U.S., 2.6 million will result in an injury to a women and almost 800,000 will result in the survivor receiving some type of healthcare. Assessment of injuries to the skin resulting from sexual assault is known to play an important role in the health care and criminal justice systems. Recent published findings indicate that women with dark skin who have a forensic examination have a significantly lower genital injury prevalence as compared to women with light skin. These findings, which raise important questions about the relationship of skin elasticity and skin color, may indicate a spurious nature of the relationship between race/ethnicity and injury prevalence. They demonstrated that skin color rather than race/ethnicity is likely the important variable that predicts genital injury prevalence. If women with dark skin are less likely to have injuries detected than women with light skin, a health disparity exists. Little is known about the role of skin elasticity across the continuum of skin colors, and whether or not differences skin elasticity may also explain the findings that injury prevalence varies by skin color.      The overall objective of this pre-doctoral application is to determine if skin elasticity varies by skin color. The applicant proposes an innovative approach to answer the question: Can the previous findings that genital injury prevalence varies by skin color be better understood because skin elasticity varies by skin color? The applicant anticipates that variations in skin elasticity will also be explained by age, body mass index, sun exposure, and health status. The proposed clinical research study and training plan are integral to the applicant's long-term goals, which include elucidation of potential differences in skin physiology related to color and other variables, understanding the protective and injurious mechanisms of the skin, and dissemination of applicable findings to further skin science and reduce health disparities in vulnerable populations.      Results obtained during this study, to take place at the University of Pennsylvania, have potentially large scale public health benefits. Findings will provide information that will influence the procedure for forensic examinations after sexual assault and guidelines for evaluating injuries in a legal setting. If skin elasticity is indeed different in women with different skin colors, addressing these differences may improve techniques for the forensic examination and provide the impetus for increased reporting rates following sexual assault.          ",Skin Elasticity and Skin Color: Understanding Health Disparity in Sexual Assault,7611402,F31NR011106,"['Decubitus ulcer ', ' Pressure Ulcer ', ' Pressure Sore ', ' Bedsore ', ' Bed Sores ', ' Skin ', ' Childbirth ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Legal ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Elasticity ', ' Address ', ' Sun Exposure ', ' sunlight exposure ', ' solar exposure ', ' Detection ', ' Collection ', ' Rate ', ' Female ', ' Guidelines ', ' Forearm ', ' Forensic Medicine ', ' Forensics ', ' Affect ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Injury ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Au element ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Survivors ', ' Training ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' sexual assault ', ' sexual attack ', ' assaulted sexually ', ' Literature ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Skin tanning ', ' Tanning ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Play ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Forcible intercourse ', ' Rape ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' sacrum ', ' Sacral Bone ', ' Science ', ' Skin Physiology ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Thigh structure ', ' Thigh ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Location ', ' Genital injury ', ' digital imaging ', ' computer imaging ', ' skin color ', ' Agreement ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Reporting ', ' physical assault ', ' physical attack ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Documentation ', ' Coitus ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Color ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2008,40934,0.13669271490225676
"Birth, Muscle Injury and Pelvic Floor Dysfunction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks to improve care for the women who suffer the priority health conditions of pelvic floor dysfunction; problems that arise due to women's unique role in giving birth. It addresses the sex disparities that exist in these problems. Each year 3 million women deliver babies and 300,000 women need surgery for pelvic floor dysfunction. A lack of basic understanding of the mechanisms of birth-related injury and recovery during reproductive years and mechanisms of prolapse later in life block efforts to prevent damage, improve recovery, or improve treatment. We seek continued support for a broadly interdisciplinary group of researchers from 4 schools and 2 institutes to that has expedited development of new knowledge needed to improve treatment and prevention. Project 1: ""Birth Biomechanics"" will test hypotheses concerning basic mechanisms of pelvic floor injury during vaginal birth; the single largest factor in causing pelvic floor dysfunction to identify specific situations may increase or decrease injury risk. Project 2: ""Injury Recovery"" will identify risk factors associated with levator injury, test the hypothesis that these injuries are, in fact, related to vaginal delivery and determine early predictors of eventual recovery. Project 3, ""Mechanisms of Posterior Vaginal Prolapse"" will use advanced imaging and deformation analysis to test hypotheses concerning the basic disease mechanisms responsible for posterior vaginal wall prolapse, one of the most common and strongly birth-associated pelvic floor dysfunction.

"Injury from Sexual Assault: Addressing Health Disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sexual assault is a silent, violent epidemic that physically injures an estimated 2.6 million females in the U.S. ach year; 800,000 females will receive some type of health care as a result of their injuries. This competing continuation application builds on the unexpected finding that significantly fewer ano-genital injuries occurred n Black/African American women than in White/Caucasian women following both consensual and non- consensual sexual intercourse. We believe these differences can be explained by variation in visibility of injury due to skin color. If differences in visibility lead to lower observed prevalence of injury in women with dark skin, they are at a disadvantage within the healthcare and legal systems because their injuries are not treated and prosecutors are less likely to file charges. The objectives include determining: 1) if women after non-consensual sexual assault have a significantly greater prevalence, frequency, and severity of intercourse-related ano-genital injuries than women after consensual sexual intercourse; 2) if intercourse- related injuries are less likely to be identified in women of race/ethnicities with darker skin color after adjusting for biometrically-derived measures of skin color; and 3) if there is a constellation of injury types (Tears, Ecchymoses, Abrasions, Redness, Swelling, or TEARS) and severities within specific anatomical locations that best discriminates victims of sexual assault from women who have had consensual intercourse; and to create 4) an injury map and genital injury severity scale (GISS) that are empirically- derived tools that can be used by clinicians to evaluate lack of consent. We will prospectively enroll 400 Consensual Control, ethnically/racially diverse participants who will undergo a forensic exam and digital imaging following consensual sex. Data derived from the exam will be compared to data from a retrospective review of forensic records and digital images from 400 matched Non-consensual Sexual Assault Survivors. Results of refined biometric imaging techniques will allow us to: 1) create a genital injury severity scale (GISS); 2) empirically test the association between skin colorimetric variables and ano-genital injury prevalence, frequency, and severity within each study group; 3) compare Consensual and Non-consensual Groups in terms of their injury-related characteristics, controlling for skin color variables; 4) predict or differentiate Consensual versus Non-consensual Group membership using modern classification statistics; and 5) construct a predictive Injury Map with clinical utility based on the results of classification analyses.

"IDENTIFYING FEMALE ATHLETES AT HIGH RISK FOR ACL INJURY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is now widely recognized that gender-based differences can play a major role in the predisposition to disease and injury, yet this remains an understudied phenomenon. Adolescent females who participate in jumping and pivoting sports suffer anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury at a 4 to 6-fold greater rate than adolescent males participating in the same sports. The reason(s) for this ACL injury disparity remain(s) obscure. Prior to puberty, male and female injury risk appears equal. Our long-term objectives are to determine how female athletes become more susceptible to non-contact ACL injury, prospectively identify those female athletes who are more susceptible to injury and to determine the underlying mechanistic cause(s) of increased risk at the biomechanical and biochemical levels and to optimize the effectiveness of treatments designed to prevent ACL injuries. Towards these goals, we propose to test the central hypothesis that the increases in lower extremity bone length and body mass that occur during puberty, without the neuromuscular performance spurt that most males demonstrate, will increase dynamic valgus, knee joint loading and injury risk in a subset of female athletes. It will also test the hypothesis that measures relating to dynamic valgus will prove predictive of ACL injury risk in high-risk female athletes. Specific Aim 1 will determine if following the onset of pubertal growth, increases in tibia and femur length and body mass, in the absence of increases in strength and recruitment of the musculature at the hip and knee that controls knee position and load, will lead to decreased neuromuscular control as measured by increased dynamic valgus in a subset of maturing female athletes. Specific Aim 2 will determine if objective biomechanical measures can predict relative ACL injury risk in female athletes. We hypothesize that a model that incorporates measures of dynamic valgus and variables that contribute to neuromuscular control of valgus (hip adduction moment) and increased knee joint load (knee abduction moment) will prove both sensitive and specific predictors of ACL injury risk in female athletes. These data should provide a foundation for approaching both the mechanistic questions underlying risk disparity, as well as increase our ability to direct high-risk athletes to effective, targeted interventions, which are proposed. Prevention of female rates from 5 times to equal males' would allow >30,000 females annually to continue the benefits of sports participation and to avoid the long-term complications of osteoarthritis, which may occur with a 10-fold greater incidence in the ACL-injured population.

"Sex Hormones and Rat Anterior Cruciate Ligament Strength    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women are between 2 and 10 times more likely to injure their anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) than men participating in similar military and athletic activities. Annual costs for surgical repair and rehabilitation of ACL injuries are over $850 million in females, alone. These expenses do not include the long-term costs related to the premature osteoarthritis (OA) that often follows the initial trauma. Gender specific differences in the hormonal milieu and response to specific steroid sex hormones have been suggested as potential causes for the disparities in ACL strength and injury risk between males and females. Most ACL injuries result from high tensile loads applied to the ligament during cutting and jumping. Type-I alpha-1 (T1C) and Type - 3 collagen (T3C) are the crucial structural components that define the ligament's ability to withstand tensile loads. If sex hormones influence ACL strength in a gender specific manner they must do so by mediating the mRNA transcription that regulates the T1C and T3C protein content essential to the ligament's mechanical strength. The mechanism and time course for sex hormones to modulate the collagen content and strength of the ACL is unknown. We hypothesize that steroid sex hormones mediate gender specific differences in the Type I and Type III collagen content and the mechanical strength of the ACL. To test this hypothesis the studies proposed in these specific aims will use a hydraulic materials testing device and Western blot analysis to measure ACL mechanical strength and collagen protein content in skeletally mature male and female rats injected with testosterone, estradiol or a combination of these hormones for 15 days. In our first specific aim the tensile strength of the ACL will be tested to demonstrate that sex hormones mediate gender specific changes in the strength of the ACL. Our second specific aim will clarify the mechanism by which sex hormones mediate changes in ligament strength by using Western blot analysis to demonstrate that selected steroid sex hormones mediate gender specific differences in T1C and T3C protein in the rat ACL. Accomplishing these aims will improve our understanding of the mechanism by which sex hormones influence collagen content and ACL strength and further explain the gender disparities in ACL injury rate. These findings are important as they will help direct future studies to identify women at risk for ACL injury and develop novel strategies to prevent their occurrence. This project is designed to determine the influence of selected steroid sex hormones on the collagen content and strength of the rat anterior cruciate ligament. It combines Western Blot analysis and materials testing in an in-vivo model. The proposed studies will improve our understanding of the mechanism by which sex hormones influence collagen content and ACL strength and further explain the gender disparities in ACL injury rate. These studies are important and they will help direct future studies to identify women at risk for ACL injury and develop novel strategies to prevent their occurrence.          ",Sex Hormones and Rat Anterior Cruciate Ligament Strength,7363349,R03AR054573,"['prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Estradiol ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17-diol (17beta)- ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Athletic ', ' Harvest ', ' Measurable ', ' in vivo ', ' in vivo Model ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' Rate ', ' Female ', ' Femur ', ' Future ', ' Injury ', ' improved ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Acute ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Collagen Fiber ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Ligaments ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' male ', ' Materials Testing ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Military Personnel ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Daily ', ' Procollagen ', ' Proteins ', ' gene product ', ' Sprague-Dawley Rats ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' sex steroid ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Life ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Tensile Strength ', ' Testing ', ' Testosterone ', ' Trans-Testosterone ', ' Therapeutic Testosterone ', ' Testosterone Propionate ', ' Androst-4-en-3-one, 17-(1-oxopropoxy)-(17-beta)- ', ' tibia ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' day ', ' Complex ', ' human tissue ', ' Hormonal ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Western Blotting ', ' protein blotting ', ' Western Immunoblotting ', ' Body Weight ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Devices ', ' Reporting ', ' Elevation ', ' reproductive ', ' Anterior Cruciate Ligament ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Collagen ', ' Collagen Type III ', ' Estrous Cycle ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Trauma ', "" men's group "", ' male group ', ' Connective Tissue ', ' ']",NIAMS,MEDSTAR HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2008,80406,0.08103527565722289
"Socioeconomic Status and Post-Injury Quality of Life and Functional Ability    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 award will allow the candidate to obtain the training and skills necessary to develop and lead patient-oriented research projects in the field of quality of life and functional outcomes after injury. The aims of the career development plan are for the candidate to acquire core knowledge, to gain further expertise in research methodology, data management and interpretation, and to strengthen his scientific writing, and academic leadership skills. To achieve the career development aims, the candidate will have an interdisciplinary mentor team, will have an in-depth didactic experience, will carry out a mentored research project and will develop future research protocols in his area of interest. The candidate's mentored research plan will utilize the resources of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and guidance of the candidate's mentors (Donna Hathaway, PhD, Andrew Bush, PhD, and Timothy Fabian, MD) to achieve the specific aims of the project. The specific aims are: (1) To determine the relationship between pre-injury socioeconomic status and functional ability following moderate to severe injury; (2) To investigate the association between pre-injury socioeconomic status and quality of life following moderate to severe injury. To address these aims 250 moderately to severely injured persons admitted to the only Level I Trauma Center for a 150-mile radius to Memphis, Tennessee will be followed for one year. Detailed information regarding participants' individual level socioeconomic status and pre-injury quality of life and functional ability will be obtained as close to the time of admission as possible. The specific census tract group in which the participant lives will be determined using geocoding. From this information specific neighborhood level socioeconomic indicators will be determined from Census Data. Over the follow-up period, determinations of functional ability and quality of life will be made. The relationship between pre-injury socioeconomic status on the individual and neighborhood level and post-injury functional ability and quality of life will be determined using hierarchical linear modeling. Because injury touches over 28 million Americans a year from all walks of life, understanding how socioeconomic status influences recovery after injury is critical. Once this relationship is understood, interventions can be designed to ensure that injured people from all walks of life will achieve the highest levels of functional ability and quality of life possible after injury.             ",Socioeconomic Status and Post-Injury Quality of Life and Functional Ability,7447968,K23GM084427,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Mentored Clinical Oncology Award ', ' Mentored Clinical Oncology Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Clinical Scientist Award ', ' Mentored Clinical Scientist Award (K23) ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Future ', ' Injury ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Phase ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Ensure ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Linear Models ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Literature ', ' Living Wills ', ' living will ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Development Plans ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' preventative medicine ', ' tool ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' radius bone structure ', ' Radius Bone ', ' Radial Bone ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Tennessee ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' trauma centers ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Investigation ', ' Writing ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' skills training ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Touch ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' limb injury ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' County ', ' Walking ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic encephalopathy ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' minority subjects ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,K23,2008,129100,0.10651441037020815
"Occupational Injuries Among Immigrant Poultry Workers: Development & Progression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  U.S. poultry processing workers experience a disproportionate share of occupational injuries and illness compared to workers in other industries. Recent trends in this industry have resulted in a worker population that is poor, minority, and increasingly comprised of immigrants. Little research documents the onset of occupational injuries among immigrants in the poultry processing industry, the progression of these occupational injuries, or the occupational and personal characteristics associated with these occupational injuries. The overall goal of this research study is to document the nature and sources of occupational injuries among minority poultry processing workers. It follows several years of community participatory research by this team with workers in the target communities, in which a sampling frame has been developed. The specific aims are: (1) to compare the prevalence of selected musculoskeletal (MSDs) and skin disorders among Latino poultry processing workers and controls (non-poultry, Latino manual laborers), and assess the mediating and moderating effects of occupational (task, shift), structural (income, education, access to healthcare), and socio- cultural (ethnicity, beliefs, values, acculturation) factors on these disorders; (2) to document the development of selected MSDs and skin disorders and assess the mediating and moderating effects of occupational, structural, and socio-cultural factors on this development; (3) to delineate the impact of selected MSDs and skin disorders on workers' and controls' health-related quality of life, both cross-sectionally and over time; and (4) to determine the interpretation of occupational illness and injury symptomatology, self-care behaviors, and barriers to prevention, treatment seeking, and reporting among workers. These specific aims will be achieved using a linked cohort and ethnographic design, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods. 276 immigrant poultry workers with experience in processing line work </= 3 yr and 276 controls will be recruited. Data collected will include physical examination, nerve conduction, wrist ultrasound, and interview. 133 disease free new hires and 133 controls will be interviewed again at 6 months, and the complete examination at 12 months. 30 workers who have experienced progressive musculoskeletal injury or dermatological illness will be recruited for in-depth interviews based on an ""explanatory models of illness"" framework.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Poultry processing workers experience high rates of injuries, but good estimates of the number and types of injuries are unavailable. This study will provide such data, as well as information on the causes and consequences of these injuries. Such research will provide the basis of future efforts to reduce disparities in occupational injuries in the fastest growing segment of the meat processing industry through education and enforcement.           Project Narrative Relevance: Poultry processing workers experience high rates of injuries, but good estimates of the number and types of injuries are unavailable.

"Disparities in Pediatric Trauma Outcomes: Context, Access and Quality of Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Injury is the number one cause of death for children. Although it is known that underprivileged children have an increased trauma mortality, there is a significant gap in our knowledge about the role access to quality trauma care plays in disparate outcomes for injured children. Whether the higher mortality rate is caused by an increased incidence of severe injury or an increased death rate for a given injury (severity- adjusted mortality) is important because each require different healthcare delivery and policy interventions. If underprivileged children have higher severity of injury and more lethal mechanisms of injury this would call for programs focused on environmental and behavioral modification. However if children also die because of lack of access to quality trauma care, this implies the institutionalization of inequitable care. An under- standing of the forces that influence trauma access, as well as an assessment of the quality of care provided, are vital to improving outcomes for children with trauma and will allow providers and policy makers to target trauma prevention strategies and implement system changes that will improve overall outcomes. While it is known that specialized trauma care improves outcomes, a significant proportion of severely injured persons are cared for outside the trauma system, thus a population-based analysis is necessary. We will use 1990-2006 California Vital Statistics death certificate data, and California Office of Statewide Planning and Development Patient Discharge Database records to identify all injured children admitted to California hospitals or who died prior to hospitalization. We will first determine if socioeconomic status is associated with an increased rate of out of hospital death, increased hospitalization rate for a given injury (controlling for severity), or increased severity-adjusted mortality. We will develop a robust mortality prediction model for injured children using patient level variables which will allow us to assess the association of system level variables such as rural status, and hospital volume on risk adjusted mortality. We will also identify predictors of trauma care access for children. This research foundation will allow for exploratory analysis of county trauma registries to identify quality of care indicators for pediatric trauma care and to determine to what degree outcome disparities are associated with poorer quality of care. My long-term career goal is to translate my clinical experience into scientifically sound epidemiological studies that will directly benefit all children. In addition to completion of this research, this award will allow me to obtain an MPH and broaden my quantitative skills. After this award period, I will continue as an independent investigator to identify disparities in pediatric trauma outcomes, improve the quality of emergency medical care and design community, regional and state-wide system interventions to prevent pediatric trauma, reduce outcome disparities and improve the overall quality of care provided to injured children.           ","Disparities in Pediatric Trauma Outcomes: Context, Access and Quality of Care",7502743,K23HD051595,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Death Certificates ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Provider ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Purpose ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Planning ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' County Hospitals ', ' Rural Hospitals ', ' Depth ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Numbers ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Condition ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' trauma centers ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Severities ', ' Side ', ' Award ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Location ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' experience ', ' Risk Adjustment ', ' Calibration ', ' California ', ' skills ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Disease regression ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' childhood trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' injured ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' Trauma Research ', ' ']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2008,129991,0.12586673885973085
"A Community-Based Trial to Prevent Lead Poisoning and Injuries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The contribution of residential hazards to children's health is poorly defined, but it is clear that some of the most prevalent disease and disabilities among U.S. children - including injuries and lead poisoning - would decline if such hazards were eliminated. Residential hazards also contribute to social disparities in children's health. This revised community-based participatory research application - a partnership of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital and the National tenter for Healthy Housing - would extend the follow-up of an ongoing 402-person birth cohort (n=358 in the randomized trial) designed to test the efficacy of interventions to control residential hazards in children, from 2 years of age through 5 years. This extension is critical to fully evaluate the efficacy of reducing lead and injury hazards on children's intellectual abilities, behavioral problems and injuries during the peak vulnerability of early childhood. The central hypothesis of this application is that housing interventions will reduce the prevalence of lead toxicity and residential injuries in a racially diverse sample of children. The aims and hypotheses of this application are: 1.0 Determine the efficacy of lead hazard controls on children's blood lead levels and their risk for learning and behavioral problems. 1.1 Levels of lead in dust, soil and water will be significantly lower for housing units in the lead treatment arm compared with the injury control arm at 36, 48 and 60 month home visits. 1.2 Children who are assigned to the lead treatment arm will have lifetime blood lead levels that are >20% lower than children assigned to the injury treatment arm at 5 years. 1.3 Children in the lead treatment arm will have higher IQ scores at 5 years than children in the injury treatment arm. 1.4 Children in the lead treatment arm will have fewer behavioral problems at 5 years, especially measures related to ADHD, than children in the injury treatment arm. 1.5 Higher lead exposure, measured during pregnancy and early childhood using maternal blood, cord blood, meconium and children's blood, is inversely associated with IQ scores and directly associated with behavioral problems at 5 years in children with postnatal maximal blood lead levels < 5 /jg/dL 2.0 Determine the efficacy of comprehensive housing modifications on children's risk for injuries. 2.1 Children who are assigned to a multifactorial, housing intervention to prevent injuries will have 30% fewer unscheduled medical visits for housing injuries compared with children in the lead treatment arm. This is the first trial to test the efficacy of a multifactorial intervention for the primary prevention of two of the most prevalent causes of disease and disability in US children - lead toxicity and residential injuries. If efficacious, policy could be developed to reduce disease and disability linked with these hazards. It would also help resolve the ongoing controversy about the adverse consequences of low-level lead toxicity at blood lead levels previously thought to be safe. Our partnership with the National Center for Healthy Housing will enhance our ability to translate and disseminate the research results to affected communities locally and nationally.             ",A Community-Based Trial to Prevent Lead Poisoning and Injuries,7469574,R01ES014575,"['Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead Poisoning ', ' toxicity to lead ', ' toxic effect to lead ', ' plumbism ', ' lead toxicity ', ' lead toxic effect ', ' Pb2+ toxic effect ', ' Pb2+ poisoning ', ' Pb2+ lead toxicity ', ' Pb2+ Toxicity ', ' Pb toxic effect ', ' Pb poisoning ', ' Pb lead toxicity ', ' Learning ', ' African ', ' Policies ', ' Americas ', ' Meconium ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Collaborations ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Soil ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Attention ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Week ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' postnatal ', ' Upper arm ', ' Score ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' hazard ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Impulsivity ', ' blood lead ', ' blood Pb ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Home visitation ', ' home visit ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Childhood Injury ', ' injury in children ', ' lead exposure ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' blood Pb concentration ', ' blood lead concentration ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Prevalence ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Purpose ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' motor vehicle injury ', ' injury from motor vehicle accident ', ' injury from car accident ', ' injury due to car accident ', ' car injury ', ' car accident injury ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Dust ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Modification ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Family ', ' Umbilical Cord Blood ', ' fetal cord blood ', ' Cord Blood ', ' Affect ', ' Injury ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' criminal behavior ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' House Call ', ' Home Visits ', ' Housing ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Hazard Controls ', ' Link ', ' Language ', ' disability ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' ']",NIEHS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2008,586609,0.2034883002574588
"Cooperative Perinatal Studies and Interventions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes the Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC) plan for Phase Ill - NIH-DC Initiative (NIH-DCI) to Reduce Infant Mortality in Minority Populations. GUMC proposes two community based intervention projects to be conducted sequentially over the five year study period. Project 1 is a Teen Mothers Project to increase interpartum intervals. The specific aims for Project 1are to: 1) conduct a community based intervention for teen mothers aimed at increasing interpartum intervals; and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention as compared to controls in increasing interpartum intervals, and promoting healthy reproductive practices, healthy relationships, school attendance and employment. Project 2 is an Unintentional Injury Prevention Project for Children of Families at risk. The specific aims for Project 2 are to: 1) conduct three community-based interventions (home-based intervention, Child Safety Room, educational materials) aimed at reducing injuries among children under age 5 years; and 2) evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing unintentional injury, and increasing parental knowledge, self-efficacy and practice of safety strategies. The interdisciplinary research team draws from multiple divisions of GUMC and collaborators within the NIH-DCI (GWU, HUH, CNMC). The projects build on previously developed cooperative relationships with community health care sites within DC that serve minority populations. We also propose a new partnership with a public-private neighborhood collaborative. The GUMC team offers scientific expertise in perinatal health, adolescent medicine, child development, health risk behavior, injury prevention and public health interventions. Our team has an outstanding record of success in working together to advance knowledge of health disparities and improve outcomes for minority populations.

We seek to prevent injuries in East Baltimore by building on ongoing community work: a) Johns Hopkins CARES (Children ARE Safe) mobile resource center; b) Baltimore City Fire Department neighborhood sweeps; c) Center for Community Health community health worker outreach program; and d) Environmental Justice Board academic-community partnership. We will demonstrate the impact of neighborhood sweeps, the mobile safety center, and community health workers (CHWs) on safety and health. During sweeps, fire inspectors go door-to-door providing free smoke alarms, identifying fire and safety hazards in the home and in the neighborhood, and reporting hazards for remediation. We will enhance these sweeps by working with CHWs and making the CARES mobile safety center available. The center is a 40-foot vehicle with fun, interactive educational exhibits, which will offer families additional low cost safety products. We will compare communities receiving these enhanced sweeps to communities that receive the fire departments standard sweeps. The evaluation design includes surveying randomly selected households in the randomly assigned participating communities before the sweeps begin and after they conclude. We will also enroll cohorts of families at the time of the door-to-door sweeps to collect baseline and follow -up data. We will supplement self-reported data on safety knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors with observations of home and neighborhood fire and safety hazards and data on emergency department visits. We will use qualitative research methods to assess the roles and impacts of the partners on development of the study, implementation of the proposed interventions, and dissemination of results. Results will be widely disseminated by our community partner organizations and through the scholarly literature. Results will contribute new knowledge about reducing health disparities in injury and the utility of community partnerships for promoting home for children and families living in low income, urban environments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves a community partnership to promote fire and life safety among low income urban families. We will use door to door canvassing by fire department personnel and community health workers along with a mobile safety center. The evaluation will examine the impact of the program on safety knowledge, behaviors, and children's injury risk. We will also identify how best to work with community partners to implement child safety programs.                      ",Community Partnerships for Child Safety,7431178,R01HD059216,"['Counseling ', ' Data Reporting ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Commit ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' motor vehicle injury ', ' injury from motor vehicle accident ', ' injury from car accident ', ' injury due to car accident ', ' car injury ', ' car accident injury ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Advocacy ', ' injury prevention ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Rate ', ' Zip Code ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' foot ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Injury ', ' Motor Vehicles ', ' base ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' House Call ', ' Home Visits ', ' Household ', ' Medical ', ' Institutes ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Justice ', ' Leadership ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Maryland ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Collaborations ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Qualitative Evaluations ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Smoke ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urban Health ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Visit ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Reporting ', ' Charge ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' outreach program ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Education ', ' Community HealthTutoring ', ' Community Health Taining ', ' Community Education ', ' Community Services ', ' Community Workers ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Access to Information ', ' outreach to information ', ' Home visitation ', ' home visit ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' remediation ', ' community organizations ', ' ']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,654475,0.13895143317667266
"Child Safety Seat Intervention for Pacific Northwest Tribes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for American Indian (Al) children, proper use of age-appropriate child restraint systems can substantially reduce the number of fatal injuries, however, many Al children still ride completely unrestrained or improperly restrained when traveling. In a recent vehicle observation study in 6 Northwestern US tribes, the majority of Al children age 8 or under rode un- (41%) or improperly (30%) restrained. While adult drivers in these tribes were commonly unaware of laws regarding vehicle restraints for children, they were receptive to receiving more information and training on proper use of child safety seats. One of the Healthy People 2010 injury prevention goals promotes the widespread and consistent use of child safety seats. Tribes in the Northwest have prioritized injury prevention, in particular, reducing morbidity and mortality from motor vehicles crashes among their membership. It is in response to a resolution passed by the member tribes of the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board that this application was prepared and submitted.      Using a community based participatory research model, our team of partners from Northwest tribes, Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board and Harborview Injury Prevention Center at University of Washington, propose to plan, implement, and evaluate child safety interventions in 6 Northwestern tribal communities. We plan to conduct qualitative interviews and focus groups to determine barriers to appropriate restraint use, work with tribes to design and carry out culturally appropriate interventions, and conduct observational vehicle surveys at three time points over the five years. We propose to use a staggered intervention design, implementing interventions in three tribes at a time, and comparing child passenger restraint use in all six tribes before and after each intervention. Tribes will be involved in every facet of the research process, including interpretation and future planning based on results. We anticipate that well designed, tribe-implemented programs will eliminate barriers, increase knowledge, and result in a sustained increase in child safety seat use.            ",Child Safety Seat Intervention for Pacific Northwest Tribes,7493816,R24MD002763,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' motor vehicle injury ', ' injury from motor vehicle accident ', ' injury from car accident ', ' injury due to car accident ', ' car injury ', ' car accident injury ', ' Address ', ' injury prevention ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Reservations ', ' Resolution ', ' Community Trial ', ' Process ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' tribal member ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Injury ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' minority health ', ' Area ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Death Rate ', ' Infant ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' knowledge of results ', ' Laws ', ' Numbers ', ' Funding ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Collaborations ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Pacific Northwest ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' restraint ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Seat Belts ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Tribes ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Adopted ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Awareness ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Belief ', ' intervention program ', ' Secure ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Toddler ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Native Alaskan ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Reporting ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Police ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' injured ', ' community intervention ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' tribal community ', ' tribal communities ', ' Childhood Injury ', ' injury in children ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' 4 year old ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' Health behavior change ', ' National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities ', ' NCMHD ', ' northwest tribe ', ' community based participatory research ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWEST PORTLAND AREA INDIAN HLTH BD,R24,2008,576996,0.18572331784105459
"Trauma System Evaluation with Survival Time Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Proposed Objective and Approach: To determine and evaluate components of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and trauma systems that contribute to improved outcomes for acutely injured persons, using public data and survival-time statistical models. Importance: Injuries are a substantial cause of death and disability, some of which may be prevented by effective EMS and trauma systems. However, evaluation of these systems is complicated by the concentration of medical resources in urban areas, and possibly unavoidable delays in initiating therapy due to geographic disparities. To overcome this methodological problem, we propose using survival-time models that explicitly adjust for the length of time between injury, intervention, and death. Data sources are now available that allow us to apply these innovative methods to make appropriate comparisons among EMS systems, their specific components, and other potentially modifiable factors. Specific Aims and Hypotheses: 1) To construct survival curves for subjects after traffic crashes or intentional injuries, using public data and standard methods of survival-time analysis; 2) To determine the overall effects of EMS and hospital intervention on these curves and models; and 3) After controlling for identifiable fixed factors, to determine how much the effects of EMS and hospital intervention vary among specific trauma systems, and use this residual variability as a measure of individual system performance. Study Design: We will use survival-time modeling techniques to analyze existing data from fatal traffic crashes, homicides, and suicides. Data on time to death following injury will be obtained from the National Vital Statistics System (death certificates), National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Fatality Analysis Reporting System (NHTSA/FARS, a census of fatal crashes), and National Violent Death Reporting System (a census of homicides and suicides). Corresponding populations at risk for death following similar injuries will be identified using FARS (which includes the other persons involved in a fatal crash), the NHTSA State Data System (police crash reports), or State Inpatient Databases (hospitalizations). The onset of EMS or hospital treatment will each be added to standard proportional hazards survival-time models as a time-varying covariate (0 before, 1 after), and we expect to show a decrease in the hazard with EMS and a further decrease with hospital treatment. This will confirm the importance of minimizing response time and prehospital time, and help explain the observed association between rural location and mortality after injury. Finally, each state will be incorporated as a cofactor in the models, allowing us to estimate the residual effect of each specific trauma system, after accounting for the disparities in their geographic settings. These models will be further refined by including the known structure of EMS and trauma systems in the corresponding regions and estimating the effects of specific components. Setting and Participants: Our study population will include injured persons during the two most recently available years from the 25 states that have data in at least four of the five public databases cited above (or the National EMS Information System currently under development). Interventions: None. Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes are survival and time elapsed from injury to death. We will also estimate the effects of EMS and hospital treatment, general characteristics of EMS and trauma systems, and effects of specific regional systems, using coefficients derived from survival-time models.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       This project presents a new opportunity to assemble data already available and apply innovative statistical methods to evaluate trauma systems. This will enable us to distinguish between the impact of level of trauma system development and other factors affecting the disparity in rural and urban trauma mortality.              This project presents a new opportunity to assemble data already available and apply innovative statistical methods to evaluate trauma systems.

"Colorado Injury Control Research Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The purpose of the Colorado Injury Control Research Center (CICRC) is to participate with communities to reduce injuries, primarily in Public Health Service (PHS) Region VIII.  Core values that govern the activities at the CICRC are:  a primary focus on reducing disparities in the prevention and control of injuries; seeking collaborative relationships with communities; innovation in education/training, community programs and   research; and identification of evidence-based, efficient approaches to prevent of injuries.  The CICRC is located in PHS Region VIII. PHS Region VIII includes Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, Utah and North Dakota. In the region, 23.2% of the population is rural non-farm, and 2.3% are rural farm residents. The population density of each state in the region is significantly lower than the US as a whole; these population densities have important implications for the development of appropriate injury prevention and control strategies in the region.  Death rates from all injuries are higher than US rates in all the states except North Dakota; unintentional injury death rates are higher than US rates in all states except Utah; motor vehicle occupant death rates are higher than US rates in all states except Colorado and Utah; and suicide death rates are higher than US rates in all states in the region.        The specific aims of the CICRC are to: 1) maintain an organizational structure to ensure effective coordination of the CICRC; 2) promote training and education related to injuries and control of injuries; 3) expand existing community based activities in injury control and prevention; 4) utilize existing data to identify injury patterns; 5) increase and diversify funding sources for injury research, community-based programs, education and training; 6)   disseminate information about injury prevention and control; 7) conduct ongoing of the CICRC program; 8) promote the development of new investigators in injury prevention and control research; and 9) conduct high quality, innovative research in acute care, prevention/control, and rehabilitation of injuries.  Public Health Relevance:  The purpose of the center is to reduce the occurrence, severity, and adverse consequences of injuries through research, education, and service.  Emphasis is placed on reducing disparities in injury outcomes through focusing on community partnerships among underserved populations, such as Native Americans, Hispanics and rural residents.          ",Colorado Injury Control Research Center,7669242,R49CE001168,[''],NCIPC,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R49,2009,974403,0.24729928849146565
"Injury from Sexual Assault: Addressing Health Disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sexual assault is a silent, violent epidemic that physically injures an estimated 2.6 million females in the U.S. ach year; 800,000 females will receive some type of health care as a result of their injuries. This competing continuation application builds on the unexpected finding that significantly fewer ano-genital injuries occurred n Black/African American women than in White/Caucasian women following both consensual and non- consensual sexual intercourse. We believe these differences can be explained by variation in visibility of injury due to skin color. If differences in visibility lead to lower observed prevalence of injury in women with dark skin, they are at a disadvantage within the healthcare and legal systems because their injuries are not treated and prosecutors are less likely to file charges. The objectives include determining: 1) if women after non-consensual sexual assault have a significantly greater prevalence, frequency, and severity of intercourse-related ano-genital injuries than women after consensual sexual intercourse; 2) if intercourse- related injuries are less likely to be identified in women of race/ethnicities with darker skin color after adjusting for biometrically-derived measures of skin color; and 3) if there is a constellation of injury types (Tears, Ecchymoses, Abrasions, Redness, Swelling, or TEARS) and severities within specific anatomical locations that best discriminates victims of sexual assault from women who have had consensual intercourse; and to create 4) an injury map and genital injury severity scale (GISS) that are empirically- derived tools that can be used by clinicians to evaluate lack of consent. We will prospectively enroll 400 Consensual Control, ethnically/racially diverse participants who will undergo a forensic exam and digital imaging following consensual sex. Data derived from the exam will be compared to data from a retrospective review of forensic records and digital images from 400 matched Non-consensual Sexual Assault Survivors. Results of refined biometric imaging techniques will allow us to: 1) create a genital injury severity scale (GISS); 2) empirically test the association between skin colorimetric variables and ano-genital injury prevalence, frequency, and severity within each study group; 3) compare Consensual and Non-consensual Groups in terms of their injury-related characteristics, controlling for skin color variables; 4) predict or differentiate Consensual versus Non-consensual Group membership using modern classification statistics; and 5) construct a predictive Injury Map with clinical utility based on the results of classification analyses. Public Health Relevance: Violence against women is a silent epidemic. The forensic exam used to collect evidence after rape needs to be equally sensitive for females with dark skin as well as females with light skin.

"Cooperative Perinatal Studies and Interventions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes the Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC) plan for Phase Ill - NIH-DC Initiative (NIH-DCI) to Reduce Infant Mortality in Minority Populations. GUMC proposes two community based intervention projects to be conducted sequentially over the five year study period. Project 1 is a Teen Mothers Project to increase interpartum intervals. The specific aims for Project 1are to: 1) conduct a community based intervention for teen mothers aimed at increasing interpartum intervals; and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention as compared to controls in increasing interpartum intervals, and promoting healthy reproductive practices, healthy relationships, school attendance and employment. Project 2 is an Unintentional Injury Prevention Project for Children of Families at risk. The specific aims for Project 2 are to: 1) conduct three community-based interventions (home-based intervention, Child Safety Room, educational materials) aimed at reducing injuries among children under age 5 years; and 2) evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing unintentional injury, and increasing parental knowledge, self-efficacy and practice of safety strategies. The interdisciplinary research team draws from multiple divisions of GUMC and collaborators within the NIH-DCI (GWU, HUH, CNMC). The projects build on previously developed cooperative relationships with community health care sites within DC that serve minority populations. We also propose a new partnership with a public-private neighborhood collaborative. The GUMC team offers scientific expertise in perinatal health, adolescent medicine, child development, health risk behavior, injury prevention and public health interventions.

"Birth, Muscle Injury and Pelvic Floor Dysfunction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks to improve care for the women who suffer the priority health conditions of pelvic floor dysfunction; problems that arise due to women's unique role in giving birth. It addresses the sex disparities that exist in these problems. Each year 3 million women deliver babies and 300,000 women need surgery for pelvic floor dysfunction. A lack of basic understanding of the mechanisms of birth-related injury and recovery during reproductive years and mechanisms of prolapse later in life block efforts to prevent damage, improve recovery, or improve treatment. We seek continued support for a broadly interdisciplinary group of researchers from 4 schools and 2 institutes to that has expedited development of new knowledge needed to improve treatment and prevention. Project 1: ""Birth Biomechanics"" will test hypotheses concerning basic mechanisms of pelvic floor injury during vaginal birth; the single largest factor in causing pelvic floor dysfunction to identify specific situations may increase or decrease injury risk. Project 2: ""Injury Recovery"" will identify risk factors associated with levator injury, test the hypothesis that these injuries are, in fact, related to vaginal delivery and determine early predictors of eventual recovery.

"Disparities in Pediatric Trauma Outcomes: Context, Access and Quality of Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Injury is the number one cause of death for children. Although it is known that underprivileged children have an increased trauma mortality, there is a significant gap in our knowledge about the role access to quality trauma care plays in disparate outcomes for injured children. Whether the higher mortality rate is caused by an increased incidence of severe injury or an increased death rate for a given injury (severity- adjusted mortality) is important because each require different healthcare delivery and policy interventions. If underprivileged children have higher severity of injury and more lethal mechanisms of injury this would call for programs focused on environmental and behavioral modification. However if children also die because of lack of access to quality trauma care, this implies the institutionalization of inequitable care. An under- standing of the forces that influence trauma access, as well as an assessment of the quality of care provided, are vital to improving outcomes for children with trauma and will allow providers and policy makers to target trauma prevention strategies and implement system changes that will improve overall outcomes. While it is known that specialized trauma care improves outcomes, a significant proportion of severely injured persons are cared for outside the trauma system, thus a population-based analysis is necessary. We will use 1990-2006 California Vital Statistics death certificate data, and California Office of Statewide Planning and Development Patient Discharge Database records to identify all injured children admitted to California hospitals or who died prior to hospitalization. We will first determine if socioeconomic status is associated with an increased rate of out of hospital death, increased hospitalization rate for a given injury (controlling for severity), or increased severity-adjusted mortality. We will develop a robust mortality prediction model for injured children using patient level variables which will allow us to assess the association of system level variables such as rural status, and hospital volume on risk adjusted mortality. We will also identify predictors of trauma care access for children. This research foundation will allow for exploratory analysis of county trauma registries to identify quality of care indicators for pediatric trauma care and to determine to what degree outcome disparities are associated with poorer quality of care. My long-term career goal is to translate my clinical experience into scientifically sound epidemiological studies that will directly benefit all children. In addition to completion of this research, this award will allow me to obtain an MPH and broaden my quantitative skills.

"Birth, Muscle Injury and Pelvic Floor Dysfunction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks to improve care for the women who suffer the priority health conditions of pelvic floor dysfunction; problems that arise due to women's unique role in giving birth. It addresses the sex disparities that exist in these problems. Each year 3 million women deliver babies and 300,000 women need surgery for pelvic floor dysfunction. A lack of basic understanding of the mechanisms of birth-related injury and recovery during reproductive years and mechanisms of prolapse later in life block efforts to prevent damage, improve recovery, or improve treatment. We seek continued support for a broadly interdisciplinary group of researchers from 4 schools and 2 institutes to that has expedited development of new knowledge needed to improve treatment and prevention. Project 1: ""Birth Biomechanics"" will test hypotheses concerning basic mechanisms of pelvic floor injury during vaginal birth; the single largest factor in causing pelvic floor dysfunction to identify specific situations may increase or decrease injury risk. Project 2: ""Injury Recovery"" will identify risk factors associated with levator injury, test the hypothesis that these injuries are, in fact, related to vaginal delivery and determine early predictors of eventual recovery. Project 3, ""Mechanisms of Posterior Vaginal Prolapse"" will use advanced imaging and deformation analysis to test hypotheses concerning the basic disease mechanisms responsible for posterior vaginal wall prolapse, one of the most common and strongly birth-associated pelvic floor dysfunction.  Core A: Administrative / Human Subjects / Biostatistics core provides project support by recruiting subjects, compiling and analyzing data and protecting subject safety. In Core A, two study groups will be formed concerning 1) Gender Impact and 2) Basic Science Futures to discuss expanding the issues raised by this research. Core B: Measurement and Imaging core will provide technical support for the projects along with integrated analysis for 2 and 3 dimensional spatial data gathered across projects.

"A Community-Based Trial to Prevent Lead Poisoning and Injuries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The contribution of residential hazards to children's health is poorly defined, but it is clear that some of the most prevalent disease and disabilities among U.S. children - including injuries and lead poisoning - would decline if such hazards were eliminated. Residential hazards also contribute to social disparities in children's health. This revised community-based participatory research application - a partnership of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital and the National tenter for Healthy Housing - would extend the follow-up of an ongoing 402-person birth cohort (n=358 in the randomized trial) designed to test the efficacy of interventions to control residential hazards in children, from 2 years of age through 5 years. This extension is critical to fully evaluate the efficacy of reducing lead and injury hazards on children's intellectual abilities, behavioral problems and injuries during the peak vulnerability of early childhood. The central hypothesis of this application is that housing interventions will reduce the prevalence of lead toxicity and residential injuries in a racially diverse sample of children. The aims and hypotheses of this application are: 1.0 Determine the efficacy of lead hazard controls on children's blood lead levels and their risk for learning and behavioral problems. 1.1 Levels of lead in dust, soil and water will be significantly lower for housing units in the lead treatment arm compared with the injury control arm at 36, 48 and 60 month home visits. 1.2 Children who are assigned to the lead treatment arm will have lifetime blood lead levels that are >20% lower than children assigned to the injury treatment arm at 5 years. 1.3 Children in the lead treatment arm will have higher IQ scores at 5 years than children in the injury treatment arm. 1.4 Children in the lead treatment arm will have fewer behavioral problems at 5 years, especially measures related to ADHD, than children in the injury treatment arm. 1.5 Higher lead exposure, measured during pregnancy and early childhood using maternal blood, cord blood, meconium and children's blood, is inversely associated with IQ scores and directly associated with behavioral problems at 5 years in children with postnatal maximal blood lead levels < 5 /jg/dL 2.0 Determine the efficacy of comprehensive housing modifications on children's risk for injuries. 2.1 Children who are assigned to a multifactorial, housing intervention to prevent injuries will have 30% fewer unscheduled medical visits for housing injuries compared with children in the lead treatment arm. This is the first trial to test the efficacy of a multifactorial intervention for the primary prevention of two of the most prevalent causes of disease and disability in US children - lead toxicity and residential injuries. If efficacious, policy could be developed to reduce disease and disability linked with these hazards. It would also help resolve the ongoing controversy about the adverse consequences of low-level lead toxicity at blood lead levels previously thought to be safe. Our partnership with the National Center for Healthy Housing will enhance our ability to translate and disseminate the research results to affected communities locally and nationally.             ",A Community-Based Trial to Prevent Lead Poisoning and Injuries,7658278,R01ES014575,"['Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' motor vehicle injury ', ' injury from motor vehicle accident ', ' injury from car accident ', ' injury due to car accident ', ' car injury ', ' car accident injury ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Dust ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' trial design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Modification ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Family ', ' Umbilical Cord Blood ', ' fetal cord blood ', ' Cord Blood ', ' Affect ', ' Injury ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' criminal behavior ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' House Call ', ' Home Visits ', ' Housing ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Hazard Controls ', ' Link ', ' Language ', ' disability ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead Poisoning ', ' toxicity to lead ', ' toxic effect to lead ', ' plumbism ', ' lead toxicity ', ' lead toxic effect ', ' Pb2+ toxic effect ', ' Pb2+ poisoning ', ' Pb2+ lead toxicity ', ' Pb2+ Toxicity ', ' Pb toxic effect ', ' Pb poisoning ', ' Pb lead toxicity ', ' Learning ', ' African ', ' Policies ', ' Americas ', ' Meconium ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Collaborations ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Soil ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Attention ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' postnatal ', ' Upper arm ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' hazard ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Impulsivity ', ' blood lead ', ' blood Pb ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Home visitation ', ' home visit ', ' Childhood Injury ', ' injury in children ', ' lead exposure ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' blood Pb concentration ', ' blood lead concentration ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Prevalence ', ' 2 year old ', ' two year old ', ' age 2 years ', ' 5 year old ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' safety testing ', ' efficacy testing ', ' ']",NIEHS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2009,572254,0.2034883002574588
"Injury from Sexual Assault: Addressing Health Disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sexual assault is a silent, violent epidemic that physically injures an estimated 2.6 million females in the U.S. ach year; 800,000 females will receive some type of health care as a result of their injuries. This competing continuation application builds on the unexpected finding that significantly fewer ano-genital injuries occurred n Black/African American women than in White/Caucasian women following both consensual and non- consensual sexual intercourse. We believe these differences can be explained by variation in visibility of injury due to skin color. If differences in visibility lead to lower observed prevalence of injury in women with dark skin, they are at a disadvantage within the healthcare and legal systems because their injuries are not treated and prosecutors are less likely to file charges. The objectives include determining: 1) if women after non-consensual sexual assault have a significantly greater prevalence, frequency, and severity of intercourse-related ano-genital injuries than women after consensual sexual intercourse; 2) if intercourse- related injuries are less likely to be identified in women of race/ethnicities with darker skin color after adjusting for biometrically-derived measures of skin color; and 3) if there is a constellation of injury types (Tears, Ecchymoses, Abrasions, Redness, Swelling, or TEARS) and severities within specific anatomical locations that best discriminates victims of sexual assault from women who have had consensual intercourse; and to create 4) an injury map and genital injury severity scale (GISS) that are empirically- derived tools that can be used by clinicians to evaluate lack of consent. We will prospectively enroll 400 Consensual Control, ethnically/racially diverse participants who will undergo a forensic exam and digital imaging following consensual sex. Data derived from the exam will be compared to data from a retrospective review of forensic records and digital images from 400 matched Non-consensual Sexual Assault Survivors. Results of refined biometric imaging techniques will allow us to: 1) create a genital injury severity scale (GISS); 2) empirically test the association between skin colorimetric variables and ano-genital injury prevalence, frequency, and severity within each study group; 3) compare Consensual and Non-consensual Groups in terms of their injury-related characteristics, controlling for skin color variables; 4) predict or differentiate Consensual versus Non-consensual Group membership using modern classification statistics; and 5) construct a predictive Injury Map with clinical utility based on the results of classification analyses. Public Health Relevance: Violence against women is a silent epidemic. The forensic exam used to collect evidence after rape needs to be equally sensitive for females with dark skin as well as females with light skin.                    ",Injury from Sexual Assault: Addressing Health Disparity,7591808,R01NR005352,"['Crime ', ' Skin ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Legal ', ' Ecchymosis ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Female ', ' Forensic Medicine ', ' Forensics ', ' Future ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Healed ', ' Penetration ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' indexing ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Visual ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' sexual assault ', ' sexual attack ', ' assaulted sexually ', ' Measurement ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Maps ', ' Melanins ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Redness ', ' tool ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Forcible intercourse ', ' Rape ', ' instrument ', ' Records ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Victimization ', ' Spectrophotometry ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Swelling ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tolonium chloride ', ' Toluidine Blue O ', ' Toluidine Blue ', ' Phenothiazin-5-ium, 3-amino-7-(dimethylamino)-2-methyl-, chloride ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' Location ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' meetings ', ' Genital system ', ' urogenital system (genital part) ', ' Genital ', ' Genital injury ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Black race ', ' digital imaging ', ' computer imaging ', ' experience ', ' skin color ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Legal system ', ' social ', ' physical assault ', ' physical attack ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Charge ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Coercion ', ' Coitus ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Accounting ', ' Color ', ' Colposcopy ', ' healing ', ' injured ', ' violence against women ', ' digital ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' Confidence Intervals ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2009,557263,0.21213300996566356
"Cooperative Perinatal Studies and Interventions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes the Georgetown University Medical Center (GUMC) plan for Phase Ill - NIH-DC Initiative (NIH-DCI) to Reduce Infant Mortality in Minority Populations. GUMC proposes two community based intervention projects to be conducted sequentially over the five year study period. Project 1 is a Teen Mothers Project to increase interpartum intervals. The specific aims for Project 1are to: 1) conduct a community based intervention for teen mothers aimed at increasing interpartum intervals; and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention as compared to controls in increasing interpartum intervals, and promoting healthy reproductive practices, healthy relationships, school attendance and employment. Project 2 is an Unintentional Injury Prevention Project for Children of Families at risk. The specific aims for Project 2 are to: 1) conduct three community-based interventions (home-based intervention, Child Safety Room, educational materials) aimed at reducing injuries among children under age 5 years; and 2) evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing unintentional injury, and increasing parental knowledge, self-efficacy and practice of safety strategies. The interdisciplinary research team draws from multiple divisions of GUMC and collaborators within the NIH-DCI (GWU, HUH, CNMC). The projects build on previously developed cooperative relationships with community health care sites within DC that serve minority populations. We also propose a new partnership with a public-private neighborhood collaborative. The GUMC team offers scientific expertise in perinatal health, adolescent medicine, child development, health risk behavior, injury prevention and public health interventions. Our team has an outstanding record of success in working together to advance knowledge of health disparities and improve outcomes for minority populations. Members of GUMC will continue to disseminate research findings from Phase 2 and collaborate on BFY and Alcohol Assessment in Minority Women.

"Community Partnerships for Child Safety    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Providing healthy and safe homes and reducing injuries are included in our nation's public health objectives. Access to safety products and knowledge about injury prevention, as well as substandard neighborhood conditions are significant barriers to child safety faced by resource poor communities. This proposal is a revision of one submitted in May, 2006. We seek to prevent injuries in East Baltimore by building on ongoing community work: a) Johns Hopkins CARES (Children ARE Safe) mobile resource center; b) Baltimore City Fire Department neighborhood sweeps; c) Center for Community Health community health worker outreach program; and d) Environmental Justice Board academic-community partnership. We will demonstrate the impact of neighborhood sweeps, the mobile safety center, and community health workers (CHWs) on safety and health. During sweeps, fire inspectors go door-to-door providing free smoke alarms, identifying fire and safety hazards in the home and in the neighborhood, and reporting hazards for remediation. We will enhance these sweeps by working with CHWs and making the CARES mobile safety center available. The center is a 40-foot vehicle with fun, interactive educational exhibits, which will offer families additional low cost safety products. We will compare communities receiving these enhanced sweeps to communities that receive the fire departments standard sweeps. The evaluation design includes surveying randomly selected households in the randomly assigned participating communities before the sweeps begin and after they conclude. We will also enroll cohorts of families at the time of the door-to-door sweeps to collect baseline and follow -up data. We will supplement self-reported data on safety knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors with observations of home and neighborhood fire and safety hazards and data on emergency department visits. We will use qualitative research methods to assess the roles and impacts of the partners on development of the study, implementation of the proposed interventions, and dissemination of results. Results will be widely disseminated by our community partner organizations and through the scholarly literature. Results will contribute new knowledge about reducing health disparities in injury and the utility of community partnerships for promoting home for children and families living in low income, urban environments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves a community partnership to promote fire and life safety among low income urban families. We will use door to door canvassing by fire department personnel and community health workers along with a mobile safety center. The evaluation will examine the impact of the program on safety knowledge, behaviors, and children's injury risk. We will also identify how best to work with community partners to implement child safety programs.

"Injury in Latina Women after Sexual Assault:  Moving Toward Health Care Equity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Skin color plays a distinct role in the detection of and perhaps the protection from skin injury in sexual assault. We have found significant differences in ano-genital injury prevalence in Black and White females after consensual sexual intercourse and sexual assault that can be more fully explained by skin color than by race/ethnicity. Little is known about the generalizability of this phenomenon to the largest minority population in the US: Latinos. While major developments in the empirical basis of DNA and toxicology samples have occurred in the past 20 years, the development of empirically-based science in the context of sexual assault has not occurred with respect to injuries. We are proposing to study ano-genital injury prospectively through digital image analysis in 200 Latinas in the U.S. and Puerto Rico following consensual sexual intercourse, and compare their injuries to those documented in medical records of 200 Latinas following sexual assault. We will combine these data with a sample of predominantly Black and White women (n=800) and analyze approximately 36,000 digital images from consensual participants and records of sexual assault victims (N=1,200) to achieve the following aims: 1) determine prevalence, frequency, and severity of intercourse- related ano-genital injuries in consensual participants and sexual assault victims; 2) determine if sexual assault victims have more discrete digital image characteristics than women who have had consensual sexual intercourse (e.g., larger area of injury, better-defined shape, more localized location, texture more distinct from adjacent areas, more redness than adjacent areas); 3) determine if previously reported differences in the prevalence, frequency, and severity of intercourse-related ano-genital injury between racial/ethnic groups will be accounted for by quantification of skin color; 4) investigate if ano-genital injuries significantly vary as a function of skin mechanics (skin elasticity and skin hydration) and factors that could potentially determine the overall health of epidermal tissue (age, body mass index, sun exposure, and health status); 5) identify the constellation of ano-genital injury type and location, socio-demographic, and intercourse-related variables that most effectively differentiates those who experienced consensual intercourse versus sexual assault.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Forensic documentation of ano-genital injuries influences decision-making throughout the criminal justice process, especially at pivotal gate-keeping stages from victim reporting to sentencing.

"Sex differences in TNFR2 signaling mechanisms following acute surgical ischemia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myocardial inflammation occurs following cardiopulmonary bypass in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and plays a crucial role in myocardial dysfunction following ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Gender disparities exist in myocardial I/R injury (1), and recent studies suggest that females exhibit enhanced protection from I/R due to an inherent resistance in detrimental TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) signaling (2). Estrogen has been implicated as a mediator of TNFR1 signaling resistance, but it is likely that estrogen facilitates these beneficial effects through other signaling cascades, including the upregulation of angiogenic factors such as VEGF. The role that TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) may play in facilitating TNFR1 signaling resistance, however, has yet to be elucidated. We therefore hypothesize that: 1) TNFR2 mediates myocardial recovery after I/R, and has a greater impact on myocardial function, proinflammatory cytokine production, and apoptotic signaling in females as compared to males; 2) TNFR2 mediates increased myocardial protection in females through the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); and 3) ablation of both TNFR1 and TNFR2 will equalize gender differences seen after myocardial injury. Therefore, the specific aims of this study are to: 1. determine whether improved functional recovery after ischemia/reperfusion is mediated by TNFR2 signaling, and if so, whether TNFR2 ablation worsens myocardial recovery to a greater degree in females 2. Determine if TNFR2 ablation increases myocardial TNF, IL-1, and IL-6; decreases VEGF; increases MARK signaling (p38, ERK, MEK, JNK), and increases proapoptotic signaling to a greater degree in females 3. determine if simultaneous ablation of both TNF receptors 1 and 2 equalizes gender differences in function. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Females have better heart function after injury. Therefore, by understanding the signals that female heart cells use to improve their function after injury, we may be able to design new drugs and therapies to treat heart disease in both men and women.              ",Sex differences in TNFR2 signaling mechanisms following acute surgical ischemia,7672626,F32HL093987,"['CSBP1 ', ' MAPK8 gene ', ' PRKM8 ', ' MAPK8 ', ' MAP Kinase 8 Gene ', ' JNK21B1/2 ', ' JNK1A2 ', ' JNK1 ', ' JNK ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogenic Compounds ', ' Estrogenic Agents ', ' Apoptotic ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Myocardial ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Injury ', ' Growth Factor ', ' Proteins Growth Factors ', ' Growth Substances ', ' Growth Agents ', ' GFAC ', ' improved ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Surgery procedures ', ' heart surgery ', ' Heart Surgical Procedures ', ' Cardiac Surgical Procedures ', ' Cardiac Surgery ', ' Acute ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interleukin-1 ', ' lymphocyte activating factor ', ' T Helper Factor ', ' Macrophage Cell Factor ', ' Lymphocyte-Stimulating Hormone ', ' Interleukin I ', ' IL1 ', ' IL-1 ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 (B cell stimulating factor 2) ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Interleukin 6 (Interferon, Beta 2) ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' Ischemia ', ' heart function ', ' Recovery ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Angiogenic Factor ', ' Angiogenesis Factor ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Myocardial dysfunction ', ' Myocardial depression ', ' Reperfusion Therapy ', ' reperfusion ', ' Reperfusion Injury ', ' Reperfusion Damage ', ' Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Up-Regulation (Physiology) ', ' Upregulation ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' Woman ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Ablation ', ' Recovery of Function ', ' functional recovery ', ' Cardiopulmonary Bypass ', ' heart bypass ', ' Heart-Lung Bypass ', ' MEKs ', ' MAPK ERK Kinases ', ' MAP-ERK Kinase ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Family ', ' TNFR ', ' TNF Receptors ', ' TNF Receptor Superfamily ', ' TNF Receptor Family Protein ', ' Cachectin Receptors ', ' cytokine ', ' Gender ', ' TNF gene ', ' Tumor Necrosis Factor Gene ', ' TNFSF2 ', ' TNF A ', ' TNF ', ' DIF ', ' Mediating ', ' heart cell ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' public health relevance ', ' Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors ', ' Vegf ', ' VEGFs ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' MAPK14 gene ', ' p38Alpha ', ' p38 MAPK Gene ', ' p38 ', ' SAPK2A ', ' PRKM15 ', ' PRKM14 ', ' Mxi2 ', ' MAPK14 ', ' EXIP ', ' CSPB1 ', ' CSBP2 ', ' ']",NHLBI,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,F32,2009,50054,0.1005300415114631
"Occupational Injuries Among Immigrant Poultry Workers: Development & Progression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  U.S. poultry processing workers experience a disproportionate share of occupational injuries and illness compared to workers in other industries. Recent trends in this industry have resulted in a worker population that is poor, minority, and increasingly comprised of immigrants. Little research documents the onset of occupational injuries among immigrants in the poultry processing industry, the progression of these occupational injuries, or the occupational and personal characteristics associated with these occupational injuries. The overall goal of this research study is to document the nature and sources of occupational injuries among minority poultry processing workers. It follows several years of community participatory research by this team with workers in the target communities, in which a sampling frame has been developed. The specific aims are: (1) to compare the prevalence of selected musculoskeletal (MSDs) and skin disorders among Latino poultry processing workers and controls (non-poultry, Latino manual laborers), and assess the mediating and moderating effects of occupational (task, shift), structural (income, education, access to healthcare), and socio- cultural (ethnicity, beliefs, values, acculturation) factors on these disorders; (2) to document the development of selected MSDs and skin disorders and assess the mediating and moderating effects of occupational, structural, and socio-cultural factors on this development; (3) to delineate the impact of selected MSDs and skin disorders on workers' and controls' health-related quality of life, both cross-sectionally and over time; and (4) to determine the interpretation of occupational illness and injury symptomatology, self-care behaviors, and barriers to prevention, treatment seeking, and reporting among workers. These specific aims will be achieved using a linked cohort and ethnographic design, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods. 276 immigrant poultry workers with experience in processing line work </= 3 yr and 276 controls will be recruited. Data collected will include physical examination, nerve conduction, wrist ultrasound, and interview. 133 disease free new hires and 133 controls will be interviewed again at 6 months, and the complete examination at 12 months. 30 workers who have experienced progressive musculoskeletal injury or dermatological illness will be recruited for in-depth interviews based on an ""explanatory models of illness"" framework.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Poultry processing workers experience high rates of injuries, but good estimates of the number and types of injuries are unavailable. This study will provide such data, as well as information on the causes and consequences of these injuries. Such research will provide the basis of future efforts to reduce disparities in occupational injuries in the fastest growing segment of the meat processing industry through education and enforcement.           Project Narrative Relevance: Poultry processing workers experience high rates of injuries, but good estimates of the number and types of injuries are unavailable.

"Socioeconomic Status and Post-Injury Quality of Life and Functional Ability    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 award will allow the candidate to obtain the training and skills necessary to develop and lead patient-oriented research projects in the field of quality of life and functional outcomes after injury. The aims of the career development plan are for the candidate to acquire core knowledge, to gain further expertise in research methodology, data management and interpretation, and to strengthen his scientific writing, and academic leadership skills. To achieve the career development aims, the candidate will have an interdisciplinary mentor team, will have an in-depth didactic experience, will carry out a mentored research project and will develop future research protocols in his area of interest. The candidate's mentored research plan will utilize the resources of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and guidance of the candidate's mentors (Donna Hathaway, PhD, Andrew Bush, PhD, and Timothy Fabian, MD) to achieve the specific aims of the project. The specific aims are: (1) To determine the relationship between pre-injury socioeconomic status and functional ability following moderate to severe injury; (2) To investigate the association between pre-injury socioeconomic status and quality of life following moderate to severe injury. To address these aims 250 moderately to severely injured persons admitted to the only Level I Trauma Center for a 150-mile radius to Memphis, Tennessee will be followed for one year. Detailed information regarding participants' individual level socioeconomic status and pre-injury quality of life and functional ability will be obtained as close to the time of admission as possible. The specific census tract group in which the participant lives will be determined using geocoding. From this information specific neighborhood level socioeconomic indicators will be determined from Census Data. Over the follow-up period, determinations of functional ability and quality of life will be made. The relationship between pre-injury socioeconomic status on the individual and neighborhood level and post-injury functional ability and quality of life will be determined using hierarchical linear modeling. Because injury touches over 28 million Americans a year from all walks of life, understanding how socioeconomic status influences recovery after injury is critical. Once this relationship is understood, interventions can be designed to ensure that injured people from all walks of life will achieve the highest levels of functional ability and quality of life possible after injury.             ",Socioeconomic Status and Post-Injury Quality of Life and Functional Ability,7631442,K23GM084427,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' interest ', ' skills training ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Future ', ' Injury ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Area ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Phase ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Ensure ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Linear Models ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Literature ', ' Living Wills ', ' living will ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Development Plans ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' preventative medicine ', ' tool ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Tennessee ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' trauma centers ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Investigation ', ' Writing ', ' Radial ', ' Radius ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Participant ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Touch ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' limb injury ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' County ', ' Walking ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic encephalopathy ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' minority subjects ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' patient population ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,K23,2009,129807,0.10651441037020815
"Child Safety Seat Intervention for Pacific Northwest Tribes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for American Indian (Al) children, proper use of age-appropriate child restraint systems can substantially reduce the number of fatal injuries, however, many Al children still ride completely unrestrained or improperly restrained when traveling. In a recent vehicle observation study in 6 Northwestern US tribes, the majority of Al children age 8 or under rode un- (41%) or improperly (30%) restrained. While adult drivers in these tribes were commonly unaware of laws regarding vehicle restraints for children, they were receptive to receiving more information and training on proper use of child safety seats. One of the Healthy People 2010 injury prevention goals promotes the widespread and consistent use of child safety seats. Tribes in the Northwest have prioritized injury prevention, in particular, reducing morbidity and mortality from motor vehicles crashes among their membership. It is in response to a resolution passed by the member tribes of the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board that this application was prepared and submitted.      Using a community based participatory research model, our team of partners from Northwest tribes, Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board and Harborview Injury Prevention Center at University of Washington, propose to plan, implement, and evaluate child safety interventions in 6 Northwestern tribal communities. We plan to conduct qualitative interviews and focus groups to determine barriers to appropriate restraint use, work with tribes to design and carry out culturally appropriate interventions, and conduct observational vehicle surveys at three time points over the five years. We propose to use a staggered intervention design, implementing interventions in three tribes at a time, and comparing child passenger restraint use in all six tribes before and after each intervention. Tribes will be involved in every facet of the research process, including interpretation and future planning based on results. We anticipate that well designed, tribe-implemented programs will eliminate barriers, increase knowledge, and result in a sustained increase in child safety seat use.            ",Child Safety Seat Intervention for Pacific Northwest Tribes,7628532,R24MD002763,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' motor vehicle injury ', ' injury from motor vehicle accident ', ' injury from car accident ', ' injury due to car accident ', ' car injury ', ' car accident injury ', ' Address ', ' injury prevention ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Reservations ', ' Resolution ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' Community Trial ', ' Process ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' tribal member ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Injury ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' working group ', ' minority health ', ' Area ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Death Rate ', ' Infant ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' knowledge of results ', ' Laws ', ' Funding ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Collaborations ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Pacific Northwest ', ' Parents ', ' restraint ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Seat Belts ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Tribes ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Adopted ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Awareness ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Belief ', ' intervention program ', ' Secure ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Toddler ', ' Reporting ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' risk perception ', ' Police ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' injured ', ' community intervention ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' tribal community ', ' tribal communities ', ' Childhood Injury ', ' injury in children ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' 4 year old ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' 8 year old ', ' eight year old ', ' age 8 years ', ' Health behavior change ', ' National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities ', ' NCMHD ', ' northwest tribe ', ' community based participatory research ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWEST PORTLAND AREA INDIAN HLTH BD,R24,2009,566968,0.18572331784105459
"Community Partnerships for Child Safety    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Providing healthy and safe homes and reducing injuries are included in our nation's public health objectives. Access to safety products and knowledge about injury prevention, as well as substandard neighborhood conditions are significant barriers to child safety faced by resource poor communities. This proposal is a revision of one submitted in May, 2006. We seek to prevent injuries in East Baltimore by building on ongoing community work: a) Johns Hopkins CARES (Children ARE Safe) mobile resource center; b) Baltimore City Fire Department neighborhood sweeps; c) Center for Community Health community health worker outreach program; and d) Environmental Justice Board academic-community partnership. We will demonstrate the impact of neighborhood sweeps, the mobile safety center, and community health workers (CHWs) on safety and health. During sweeps, fire inspectors go door-to-door providing free smoke alarms, identifying fire and safety hazards in the home and in the neighborhood, and reporting hazards for remediation. We will enhance these sweeps by working with CHWs and making the CARES mobile safety center available. The center is a 40-foot vehicle with fun, interactive educational exhibits, which will offer families additional low cost safety products. We will compare communities receiving these enhanced sweeps to communities that receive the fire departments standard sweeps. The evaluation design includes surveying randomly selected households in the randomly assigned participating communities before the sweeps begin and after they conclude. We will also enroll cohorts of families at the time of the door-to-door sweeps to collect baseline and follow -up data. We will supplement self-reported data on safety knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors with observations of home and neighborhood fire and safety hazards and data on emergency department visits. We will use qualitative research methods to assess the roles and impacts of the partners on development of the study, implementation of the proposed interventions, and dissemination of results. Results will be widely disseminated by our community partner organizations and through the scholarly literature. Results will contribute new knowledge about reducing health disparities in injury and the utility of community partnerships for promoting home for children and families living in low income, urban environments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves a community partnership to promote fire and life safety among low income urban families. We will use door to door canvassing by fire department personnel and community health workers along with a mobile safety center. The evaluation will examine the impact of the program on safety knowledge, behaviors, and children's injury risk. We will also identify how best to work with community partners to implement child safety programs.                      ",Community Partnerships for Child Safety,7681735,R01HD059216,"['Counseling ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Commit ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' motor vehicle injury ', ' injury from motor vehicle accident ', ' injury from car accident ', ' injury due to car accident ', ' car injury ', ' car accident injury ', ' Low income ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Advocacy ', ' injury prevention ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' foot ', ' Injury ', ' Motor Vehicles ', ' base ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' NIEHS ', ' House Call ', ' Home Visits ', ' Household ', ' Medical ', ' Institutes ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Leadership ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Maryland ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Collaborations ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Qualitative Evaluations ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Smoke ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urban Health ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Reporting ', ' Charge ', ' Measures ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' outreach program ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Education ', ' Community HealthTutoring ', ' Community Health Taining ', ' Community Education ', ' Community Services ', ' Community Workers ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Access to Information ', ' outreach to information ', ' Home visitation ', ' home visit ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' remediation ', ' community organizations ', ' public health relevance ', ' environmental justice ', ' ']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,635360,0.13895143317667266
"Sex Hormones and Rat Anterior Cruciate Ligament Strength    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women are between 2 and 10 times more likely to injure their anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) than men participating in similar military and athletic activities. Annual costs for surgical repair and rehabilitation of ACL injuries are over $850 million in females, alone. These expenses do not include the long-term costs related to the premature osteoarthritis (OA) that often follows the initial trauma. Gender specific differences in the hormonal milieu and response to specific steroid sex hormones have been suggested as potential causes for the disparities in ACL strength and injury risk between males and females. Most ACL injuries result from high tensile loads applied to the ligament during cutting and jumping. Type-I alpha-1 (T1C) and Type - 3 collagen (T3C) are the crucial structural components that define the ligament's ability to withstand tensile loads. If sex hormones influence ACL strength in a gender specific manner they must do so by mediating the mRNA transcription that regulates the T1C and T3C protein content essential to the ligament's mechanical strength. The mechanism and time course for sex hormones to modulate the collagen content and strength of the ACL is unknown. We hypothesize that steroid sex hormones mediate gender specific differences in the Type I and Type III collagen content and the mechanical strength of the ACL. To test this hypothesis the studies proposed in these specific aims will use a hydraulic materials testing device and Western blot analysis to measure ACL mechanical strength and collagen protein content in skeletally mature male and female rats injected with testosterone, estradiol or a combination of these hormones for 15 days. In our first specific aim the tensile strength of the ACL will be tested to demonstrate that sex hormones mediate gender specific changes in the strength of the ACL. Our second specific aim will clarify the mechanism by which sex hormones mediate changes in ligament strength by using Western blot analysis to demonstrate that selected steroid sex hormones mediate gender specific differences in T1C and T3C protein in the rat ACL. Accomplishing these aims will improve our understanding of the mechanism by which sex hormones influence collagen content and ACL strength and further explain the gender disparities in ACL injury rate. These findings are important as they will help direct future studies to identify women at risk for ACL injury and develop novel strategies to prevent their occurrence. This project is designed to determine the influence of selected steroid sex hormones on the collagen content and strength of the rat anterior cruciate ligament.

"Community Partnerships for Child Safety    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Providing healthy and safe homes and reducing injuries are included in our nation's public health objectives. Access to safety products and knowledge about injury prevention, as well as substandard neighborhood conditions are significant barriers to child safety faced by resource poor communities. This proposal is a revision of one submitted in May, 2006. We seek to prevent injuries in East Baltimore by building on ongoing community work: a) Johns Hopkins CARES (Children ARE Safe) mobile resource center; b) Baltimore City Fire Department neighborhood sweeps; c) Center for Community Health community health worker outreach program; and d) Environmental Justice Board academic-community partnership. We will demonstrate the impact of neighborhood sweeps, the mobile safety center, and community health workers (CHWs) on safety and health. During sweeps, fire inspectors go door-to-door providing free smoke alarms, identifying fire and safety hazards in the home and in the neighborhood, and reporting hazards for remediation. We will enhance these sweeps by working with CHWs and making the CARES mobile safety center available. The center is a 40-foot vehicle with fun, interactive educational exhibits, which will offer families additional low cost safety products. We will compare communities receiving these enhanced sweeps to communities that receive the fire departments standard sweeps. The evaluation design includes surveying randomly selected households in the randomly assigned participating communities before the sweeps begin and after they conclude. We will also enroll cohorts of families at the time of the door-to-door sweeps to collect baseline and follow -up data. We will supplement self-reported data on safety knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors with observations of home and neighborhood fire and safety hazards and data on emergency department visits. We will use qualitative research methods to assess the roles and impacts of the partners on development of the study, implementation of the proposed interventions, and dissemination of results. Results will be widely disseminated by our community partner organizations and through the scholarly literature. Results will contribute new knowledge about reducing health disparities in injury and the utility of community partnerships for promoting home for children and families living in low income, urban environments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves a community partnership to promote fire and life safety among low income urban families. We will use door to door canvassing by fire department personnel and community health workers along with a mobile safety center. The evaluation will examine the impact of the program on safety knowledge, behaviors, and children's injury risk. We will also identify how best to work with community partners to implement child safety programs.

"Sex Hormones and Rat Anterior Cruciate Ligament Strength    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women are between 2 and 10 times more likely to injure their anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) than men participating in similar military and athletic activities. Annual costs for surgical repair and rehabilitation of ACL injuries are over $850 million in females, alone. These expenses do not include the long-term costs related to the premature osteoarthritis (OA) that often follows the initial trauma. Gender specific differences in the hormonal milieu and response to specific steroid sex hormones have been suggested as potential causes for the disparities in ACL strength and injury risk between males and females. Most ACL injuries result from high tensile loads applied to the ligament during cutting and jumping. Type-I alpha-1 (T1C) and Type - 3 collagen (T3C) are the crucial structural components that define the ligament's ability to withstand tensile loads. If sex hormones influence ACL strength in a gender specific manner they must do so by mediating the mRNA transcription that regulates the T1C and T3C protein content essential to the ligament's mechanical strength. The mechanism and time course for sex hormones to modulate the collagen content and strength of the ACL is unknown. We hypothesize that steroid sex hormones mediate gender specific differences in the Type I and Type III collagen content and the mechanical strength of the ACL. To test this hypothesis the studies proposed in these specific aims will use a hydraulic materials testing device and Western blot analysis to measure ACL mechanical strength and collagen protein content in skeletally mature male and female rats injected with testosterone, estradiol or a combination of these hormones for 15 days. In our first specific aim the tensile strength of the ACL will be tested to demonstrate that sex hormones mediate gender specific changes in the strength of the ACL. Our second specific aim will clarify the mechanism by which sex hormones mediate changes in ligament strength by using Western blot analysis to demonstrate that selected steroid sex hormones mediate gender specific differences in T1C and T3C protein in the rat ACL. Accomplishing these aims will improve our understanding of the mechanism by which sex hormones influence collagen content and ACL strength and further explain the gender disparities in ACL injury rate. These findings are important as they will help direct future studies to identify women at risk for ACL injury and develop novel strategies to prevent their occurrence. This project is designed to determine the influence of selected steroid sex hormones on the collagen content and strength of the rat anterior cruciate ligament. It combines Western Blot analysis and materials testing in an in-vivo model. The proposed studies will improve our understanding of the mechanism by which sex hormones influence collagen content and ACL strength and further explain the gender disparities in ACL injury rate.

"A Community-Based Trial to Prevent Lead Poisoning and Injuries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The contribution of residential hazards to children's health is poorly defined, but it is clear that some of the most prevalent disease and disabilities among U.S. children - including injuries and lead poisoning - would decline if such hazards were eliminated. Residential hazards also contribute to social disparities in children's health. This revised community-based participatory research application - a partnership of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital and the National tenter for Healthy Housing - would extend the follow-up of an ongoing 402-person birth cohort (n=358 in the randomized trial) designed to test the efficacy of interventions to control residential hazards in children, from 2 years of age through 5 years. This extension is critical to fully evaluate the efficacy of reducing lead and injury hazards on children's intellectual abilities, behavioral problems and injuries during the peak vulnerability of early childhood. The central hypothesis of this application is that housing interventions will reduce the prevalence of lead toxicity and residential injuries in a racially diverse sample of children. The aims and hypotheses of this application are: 1.0 Determine the efficacy of lead hazard controls on children's blood lead levels and their risk for learning and behavioral problems. 1.1 Levels of lead in dust, soil and water will be significantly lower for housing units in the lead treatment arm compared with the injury control arm at 36, 48 and 60 month home visits. 1.2 Children who are assigned to the lead treatment arm will have lifetime blood lead levels that are >20% lower than children assigned to the injury treatment arm at 5 years. 1.3 Children in the lead treatment arm will have higher IQ scores at 5 years than children in the injury treatment arm. 1.4 Children in the lead treatment arm will have fewer behavioral problems at 5 years, especially measures related to ADHD, than children in the injury treatment arm. 1.5 Higher lead exposure, measured during pregnancy and early childhood using maternal blood, cord blood, meconium and children's blood, is inversely associated with IQ scores and directly associated with behavioral problems at 5 years in children with postnatal maximal blood lead levels < 5 /jg/dL 2.0 Determine the efficacy of comprehensive housing modifications on children's risk for injuries. 2.1 Children who are assigned to a multifactorial, housing intervention to prevent injuries will have 30% fewer unscheduled medical visits for housing injuries compared with children in the lead treatment arm. This is the first trial to test the efficacy of a multifactorial intervention for the primary prevention of two of the most prevalent causes of disease and disability in US children - lead toxicity and residential injuries. If efficacious, policy could be developed to reduce disease and disability linked with these hazards. It would also help resolve the ongoing controversy about the adverse consequences of low-level lead toxicity at blood lead levels previously thought to be safe. Our partnership with the National Center for Healthy Housing will enhance our ability to translate and disseminate the research results to affected communities locally and nationally.             ",A Community-Based Trial to Prevent Lead Poisoning and Injuries,7813987,R01ES014575,"['Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' motor vehicle injury ', ' injury from motor vehicle accident ', ' injury from car accident ', ' injury due to car accident ', ' car injury ', ' car accident injury ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Dust ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' trial design ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Modification ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Family ', ' Umbilical Cord Blood ', ' fetal cord blood ', ' Cord Blood ', ' Affect ', ' Injury ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' criminal behavior ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' House Call ', ' Home Visits ', ' Housing ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Hazard Controls ', ' Link ', ' Language ', ' disability ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead Poisoning ', ' toxicity to lead ', ' toxic effect to lead ', ' plumbism ', ' lead toxicity ', ' lead toxic effect ', ' Pb2+ toxic effect ', ' Pb2+ poisoning ', ' Pb2+ lead toxicity ', ' Pb2+ Toxicity ', ' Pb toxic effect ', ' Pb poisoning ', ' Pb lead toxicity ', ' Learning ', ' African ', ' Policies ', ' Americas ', ' Meconium ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Collaborations ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Soil ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Attention ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' postnatal ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' hazard ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' Impulsivity ', ' blood lead ', ' blood Pb ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Home visitation ', ' home visit ', ' Childhood Injury ', ' injury in children ', ' lead exposure ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' blood Pb concentration ', ' blood lead concentration ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Prevalence ', ' 2 year old ', ' two year old ', ' age 2 years ', ' 5 year old ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' safety testing ', ' efficacy testing ', ' randomized trial ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' arm ', ' ']",NIEHS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2010,585015,0.2034883002574588
"Injury from Sexual Assault: Addressing Health Disparity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sexual assault is a silent, violent epidemic that physically injures an estimated 2.6 million females in the U.S. ach year; 800,000 females will receive some type of health care as a result of their injuries. This competing continuation application builds on the unexpected finding that significantly fewer ano-genital injuries occurred n Black/African American women than in White/Caucasian women following both consensual and non- consensual sexual intercourse. We believe these differences can be explained by variation in visibility of injury due to skin color. If differences in visibility lead to lower observed prevalence of injury in women with dark skin, they are at a disadvantage within the healthcare and legal systems because their injuries are not treated and prosecutors are less likely to file charges. The objectives include determining: 1) if women after non-consensual sexual assault have a significantly greater prevalence, frequency, and severity of intercourse-related ano-genital injuries than women after consensual sexual intercourse; 2) if intercourse- related injuries are less likely to be identified in women of race/ethnicities with darker skin color after adjusting for biometrically-derived measures of skin color; and 3) if there is a constellation of injury types (Tears, Ecchymoses, Abrasions, Redness, Swelling, or TEARS) and severities within specific anatomical locations that best discriminates victims of sexual assault from women who have had consensual intercourse; and to create 4) an injury map and genital injury severity scale (GISS) that are empirically- derived tools that can be used by clinicians to evaluate lack of consent. We will prospectively enroll 400 Consensual Control, ethnically/racially diverse participants who will undergo a forensic exam and digital imaging following consensual sex. Data derived from the exam will be compared to data from a retrospective review of forensic records and digital images from 400 matched Non-consensual Sexual Assault Survivors. Results of refined biometric imaging techniques will allow us to: 1) create a genital injury severity scale (GISS); 2) empirically test the association between skin colorimetric variables and ano-genital injury prevalence, frequency, and severity within each study group; 3) compare Consensual and Non-consensual Groups in terms of their injury-related characteristics, controlling for skin color variables; 4) predict or differentiate Consensual versus Non-consensual Group membership using modern classification statistics; and 5) construct a predictive Injury Map with clinical utility based on the results of classification analyses. Public Health Relevance: Violence against women is a silent epidemic.

"Injury in Latina Women after Sexual Assault:  Moving Toward Health Care Equity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Skin color plays a distinct role in the detection of and perhaps the protection from skin injury in sexual assault. We have found significant differences in ano-genital injury prevalence in Black and White females after consensual sexual intercourse and sexual assault that can be more fully explained by skin color than by race/ethnicity. Little is known about the generalizability of this phenomenon to the largest minority population in the US: Latinos. While major developments in the empirical basis of DNA and toxicology samples have occurred in the past 20 years, the development of empirically-based science in the context of sexual assault has not occurred with respect to injuries. We are proposing to study ano-genital injury prospectively through digital image analysis in 200 Latinas in the U.S. and Puerto Rico following consensual sexual intercourse, and compare their injuries to those documented in medical records of 200 Latinas following sexual assault. We will combine these data with a sample of predominantly Black and White women (n=800) and analyze approximately 36,000 digital images from consensual participants and records of sexual assault victims (N=1,200) to achieve the following aims: 1) determine prevalence, frequency, and severity of intercourse- related ano-genital injuries in consensual participants and sexual assault victims; 2) determine if sexual assault victims have more discrete digital image characteristics than women who have had consensual sexual intercourse (e.g., larger area of injury, better-defined shape, more localized location, texture more distinct from adjacent areas, more redness than adjacent areas); 3) determine if previously reported differences in the prevalence, frequency, and severity of intercourse-related ano-genital injury between racial/ethnic groups will be accounted for by quantification of skin color; 4) investigate if ano-genital injuries significantly vary as a function of skin mechanics (skin elasticity and skin hydration) and factors that could potentially determine the overall health of epidermal tissue (age, body mass index, sun exposure, and health status); 5) identify the constellation of ano-genital injury type and location, socio-demographic, and intercourse-related variables that most effectively differentiates those who experienced consensual intercourse versus sexual assault.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Forensic documentation of ano-genital injuries influences decision-making throughout the criminal justice process, especially at pivotal gate-keeping stages from victim reporting to sentencing.

"Occupational Injuries Among Immigrant Poultry Workers: Development & Progression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  U.S. poultry processing workers experience a disproportionate share of occupational injuries and illness compared to workers in other industries. Recent trends in this industry have resulted in a worker population that is poor, minority, and increasingly comprised of immigrants. Little research documents the onset of occupational injuries among immigrants in the poultry processing industry, the progression of these occupational injuries, or the occupational and personal characteristics associated with these occupational injuries. The overall goal of this research study is to document the nature and sources of occupational injuries among minority poultry processing workers. It follows several years of community participatory research by this team with workers in the target communities, in which a sampling frame has been developed. The specific aims are: (1) to compare the prevalence of selected musculoskeletal (MSDs) and skin disorders among Latino poultry processing workers and controls (non-poultry, Latino manual laborers), and assess the mediating and moderating effects of occupational (task, shift), structural (income, education, access to healthcare), and socio- cultural (ethnicity, beliefs, values, acculturation) factors on these disorders; (2) to document the development of selected MSDs and skin disorders and assess the mediating and moderating effects of occupational, structural, and socio-cultural factors on this development; (3) to delineate the impact of selected MSDs and skin disorders on workers' and controls' health-related quality of life, both cross-sectionally and over time; and (4) to determine the interpretation of occupational illness and injury symptomatology, self-care behaviors, and barriers to prevention, treatment seeking, and reporting among workers. These specific aims will be achieved using a linked cohort and ethnographic design, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods. 276 immigrant poultry workers with experience in processing line work </= 3 yr and 276 controls will be recruited. Data collected will include physical examination, nerve conduction, wrist ultrasound, and interview. 133 disease free new hires and 133 controls will be interviewed again at 6 months, and the complete examination at 12 months. 30 workers who have experienced progressive musculoskeletal injury or dermatological illness will be recruited for in-depth interviews based on an ""explanatory models of illness"" framework.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Poultry processing workers experience high rates of injuries, but good estimates of the number and types of injuries are unavailable.

"Colorado Injury Control Research Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The purpose of the Colorado Injury Control Research Center (CICRC) is to participate with communities to reduce injuries, primarily in Public Health Service (PHS) Region VIII.  Core values that govern the activities at the CICRC are:  a primary focus on reducing disparities in the prevention and control of injuries; seeking collaborative relationships with communities; innovation in education/training, community programs and   research; and identification of evidence-based, efficient approaches to prevent of injuries.  The CICRC is located in PHS Region VIII. PHS Region VIII includes Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, Utah and North Dakota. In the region, 23.2% of the population is rural non-farm, and 2.3% are rural farm residents. The population density of each state in the region is significantly lower than the US as a whole; these population densities have important implications for the development of appropriate injury prevention and control strategies in the region.  Death rates from all injuries are higher than US rates in all the states except North Dakota; unintentional injury death rates are higher than US rates in all states except Utah; motor vehicle occupant death rates are higher than US rates in all states except Colorado and Utah; and suicide death rates are higher than US rates in all states in the region.        The specific aims of the CICRC are to: 1) maintain an organizational structure to ensure effective coordination of the CICRC; 2) promote training and education related to injuries and control of injuries; 3) expand existing community based activities in injury control and prevention; 4) utilize existing data to identify injury patterns; 5) increase and diversify funding sources for injury research, community-based programs, education and training; 6)   disseminate information about injury prevention and control; 7) conduct ongoing of the CICRC program; 8) promote the development of new investigators in injury prevention and control research; and 9) conduct high quality, innovative research in acute care, prevention/control, and rehabilitation of injuries.  Public Health Relevance:  The purpose of the center is to reduce the occurrence, severity, and adverse consequences of injuries through research, education, and service.  Emphasis is placed on reducing disparities in injury outcomes through focusing on community partnerships among underserved populations, such as Native Americans, Hispanics and rural residents.          ",Colorado Injury Control Research Center,7904751,R49CE001168,[''],NCIPC,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R49,2010,936431,0.24729928849146565
"Injury in Latina Women after Sexual Assault:  Moving Toward Health Care Equity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Skin color plays a distinct role in the detection of and perhaps the protection from skin injury in sexual assault. We have found significant differences in ano-genital injury prevalence in Black and White females after consensual sexual intercourse and sexual assault that can be more fully explained by skin color than by race/ethnicity. Little is known about the generalizability of this phenomenon to the largest minority population in the US: Latinos. While major developments in the empirical basis of DNA and toxicology samples have occurred in the past 20 years, the development of empirically-based science in the context of sexual assault has not occurred with respect to injuries. We are proposing to study ano-genital injury prospectively through digital image analysis in 200 Latinas in the U.S. and Puerto Rico following consensual sexual intercourse, and compare their injuries to those documented in medical records of 200 Latinas following sexual assault. We will combine these data with a sample of predominantly Black and White women (n=800) and analyze approximately 36,000 digital images from consensual participants and records of sexual assault victims (N=1,200) to achieve the following aims: 1) determine prevalence, frequency, and severity of intercourse- related ano-genital injuries in consensual participants and sexual assault victims; 2) determine if sexual assault victims have more discrete digital image characteristics than women who have had consensual sexual intercourse (e.g., larger area of injury, better-defined shape, more localized location, texture more distinct from adjacent areas, more redness than adjacent areas); 3) determine if previously reported differences in the prevalence, frequency, and severity of intercourse-related ano-genital injury between racial/ethnic groups will be accounted for by quantification of skin color; 4) investigate if ano-genital injuries significantly vary as a function of skin mechanics (skin elasticity and skin hydration) and factors that could potentially determine the overall health of epidermal tissue (age, body mass index, sun exposure, and health status); 5) identify the constellation of ano-genital injury type and location, socio-demographic, and intercourse-related variables that most effectively differentiates those who experienced consensual intercourse versus sexual assault.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Forensic documentation of ano-genital injuries influences decision-making throughout the criminal justice process, especially at pivotal gate-keeping stages from victim reporting to sentencing. The forensic exam used to collect evidence after rape needs to be equally sensitive for females with dark skin as well as females with light skin.              Public Health Relevance: Forensic documentation of ano-genital injuries influences decision-making throughout the criminal justice process, especially at pivotal gate-keeping stages from victim reporting to sentencing.

"Secondary Injuries among U.S. Workers with Disabilities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are currently 40 to 50 million individuals living with disabilities in the U.S. and the number of adults with disabilities is expected to rise in the coming years. Although studies over the last decade have demonstrated that individuals with disabilities are at a significantly higher risk for nonfatal injuries, much remains to be learned about the risks and patterns of occupational and non-occupational injuries in workers with disabilities. The long-term goal of this project is to study associations between pre-existing disabilities and secondary injuries and to investigate the medical costs and methods of payments among U.S. workers with disabilities. The central hypotheses are (1) that workers with disabilities are at a significantly higher risk for occupational and non-occupational injuries than workers without disabilities, and (2) that the annual costs associated with medical care for these injuries are significantly higher in workers with disabilities. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the relationship between pre-existing disability and secondary injury and identifying injury patterns will allow for the development of better evidence-based policies and safety programs for U.S. workers with disabilities. Thus, the proposed research will help promote the NIOSH mission to address occupational safety and health disparities in special populations. Data from two large representative national surveys - the 1997-2004 National Health Interview Survey, and the 2002-2006 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, will be analyzed to pursue three specific aims: 1) To compare occupational injuries and non-occupational injuries among U.S. workers with and without disabilities; 2) To compare the medical service costs for treating occupational injuries and non- occupational injuries among U.S. workers with and without disabilities; and 3) To compare sources of payments and out-of-pocket expenditures for the medical treatment of occupational injuries and non- occupational injuries among U.S. workers with disabilities and without disabilities. Guided by our strong preliminary data, this study will use several innovative statistical approaches. Association between pre-existing disabilities and occupational injuries and non-occupational injuries will be studied using multivariable logistic regression and Poisson regression models controlling for demographic and socioeconomic injury risk factors. Medical costs of occupational injuries and non- occupational injuries will be compared between U.S. workers with and without disabilities using bootstrap methods and a two-part regression model. Findings from the proposed research could provide much-needed scientific evidence for informing important policy decisions relevant to occupational safety and injury prevention among U.S. workers with disabilities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Both Healthy People 2010 and the 2005 U.S. Surgeon General's Call to Action to Improve the Health and Wellness of Persons with Disabilities identified health promotion and the integration of individuals into the community as national priorities.

"Trauma System Evaluation with Survival Time Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Proposed Objective and Approach: To determine and evaluate components of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and trauma systems that contribute to improved outcomes for acutely injured persons, using public data and survival-time statistical models. Importance: Injuries are a substantial cause of death and disability, some of which may be prevented by effective EMS and trauma systems. However, evaluation of these systems is complicated by the concentration of medical resources in urban areas, and possibly unavoidable delays in initiating therapy due to geographic disparities. To overcome this methodological problem, we propose using survival-time models that explicitly adjust for the length of time between injury, intervention, and death. Data sources are now available that allow us to apply these innovative methods to make appropriate comparisons among EMS systems, their specific components, and other potentially modifiable factors. Specific Aims and Hypotheses: 1) To construct survival curves for subjects after traffic crashes or intentional injuries, using public data and standard methods of survival-time analysis; 2) To determine the overall effects of EMS and hospital intervention on these curves and models; and 3) After controlling for identifiable fixed factors, to determine how much the effects of EMS and hospital intervention vary among specific trauma systems, and use this residual variability as a measure of individual system performance. Study Design: We will use survival-time modeling techniques to analyze existing data from fatal traffic crashes, homicides, and suicides. Data on time to death following injury will be obtained from the National Vital Statistics System (death certificates), National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Fatality Analysis Reporting System (NHTSA/FARS, a census of fatal crashes), and National Violent Death Reporting System (a census of homicides and suicides). Corresponding populations at risk for death following similar injuries will be identified using FARS (which includes the other persons involved in a fatal crash), the NHTSA State Data System (police crash reports), or State Inpatient Databases (hospitalizations). The onset of EMS or hospital treatment will each be added to standard proportional hazards survival-time models as a time-varying covariate (0 before, 1 after), and we expect to show a decrease in the hazard with EMS and a further decrease with hospital treatment. This will confirm the importance of minimizing response time and prehospital time, and help explain the observed association between rural location and mortality after injury. Finally, each state will be incorporated as a cofactor in the models, allowing us to estimate the residual effect of each specific trauma system, after accounting for the disparities in their geographic settings. These models will be further refined by including the known structure of EMS and trauma systems in the corresponding regions and estimating the effects of specific components. Setting and Participants: Our study population will include injured persons during the two most recently available years from the 25 states that have data in at least four of the five public databases cited above (or the National EMS Information System currently under development). Interventions: None. Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes are survival and time elapsed from injury to death. We will also estimate the effects of EMS and hospital treatment, general characteristics of EMS and trauma systems, and effects of specific regional systems, using coefficients derived from survival-time models.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       This project presents a new opportunity to assemble data already available and apply innovative statistical methods to evaluate trauma systems. This will enable us to distinguish between the impact of level of trauma system development and other factors affecting the disparity in rural and urban trauma mortality.              This project presents a new opportunity to assemble data already available and apply innovative statistical methods to evaluate trauma systems.

"Community Partnerships for Child Safety    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Providing healthy and safe homes and reducing injuries are included in our nation's public health objectives. Access to safety products and knowledge about injury prevention, as well as substandard neighborhood conditions are significant barriers to child safety faced by resource poor communities. This proposal is a revision of one submitted in May, 2006. We seek to prevent injuries in East Baltimore by building on ongoing community work: a) Johns Hopkins CARES (Children ARE Safe) mobile resource center; b) Baltimore City Fire Department neighborhood sweeps; c) Center for Community Health community health worker outreach program; and d) Environmental Justice Board academic-community partnership. We will demonstrate the impact of neighborhood sweeps, the mobile safety center, and community health workers (CHWs) on safety and health. During sweeps, fire inspectors go door-to-door providing free smoke alarms, identifying fire and safety hazards in the home and in the neighborhood, and reporting hazards for remediation. We will enhance these sweeps by working with CHWs and making the CARES mobile safety center available. The center is a 40-foot vehicle with fun, interactive educational exhibits, which will offer families additional low cost safety products. We will compare communities receiving these enhanced sweeps to communities that receive the fire departments standard sweeps. The evaluation design includes surveying randomly selected households in the randomly assigned participating communities before the sweeps begin and after they conclude. We will also enroll cohorts of families at the time of the door-to-door sweeps to collect baseline and follow -up data. We will supplement self-reported data on safety knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors with observations of home and neighborhood fire and safety hazards and data on emergency department visits.

Project 3, ""Mechanisms of Posterior Vaginal Prolapse"" will use advanced imaging and deformation analysis  to test hypotheses concerning the basic disease mechanisms responsible for posterior vaginal wall prolapse,  one of the most common and strongly birth-associated pelvic floor dysfunction.  Core A: Administrative / Human Subjects / Biostatistics core provides project support by recruiting subjects,  compiling and analyzing data and protecting subject safety. In Core A, two study groups will be formed  concerning 1) Gender Impact and 2) Basic Science Futures to discuss expanding the issues raised by this  research.  Core B: Measurement and Imaging core will provide technical support for the projects along with integrated  analysis for 2 and 3 dimensional spatial data gathered across projects. This research will produce insights to  address the women's health problem of pelvic floor dysfunction.

"Disparities in Pediatric Trauma Outcomes: Context, Access and Quality of Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Injury is the number one cause of death for children. Although it is known that underprivileged children have an increased trauma mortality, there is a significant gap in our knowledge about the role access to quality trauma care plays in disparate outcomes for injured children. Whether the higher mortality rate is caused by an increased incidence of severe injury or an increased death rate for a given injury (severity- adjusted mortality) is important because each require different healthcare delivery and policy interventions. If underprivileged children have higher severity of injury and more lethal mechanisms of injury this would call for programs focused on environmental and behavioral modification. However if children also die because of lack of access to quality trauma care, this implies the institutionalization of inequitable care. An under- standing of the forces that influence trauma access, as well as an assessment of the quality of care provided, are vital to improving outcomes for children with trauma and will allow providers and policy makers to target trauma prevention strategies and implement system changes that will improve overall outcomes. While it is known that specialized trauma care improves outcomes, a significant proportion of severely injured persons are cared for outside the trauma system, thus a population-based analysis is necessary. We will use 1990-2006 California Vital Statistics death certificate data, and California Office of Statewide Planning and Development Patient Discharge Database records to identify all injured children admitted to California hospitals or who died prior to hospitalization. We will first determine if socioeconomic status is associated with an increased rate of out of hospital death, increased hospitalization rate for a given injury (controlling for severity), or increased severity-adjusted mortality. We will develop a robust mortality prediction model for injured children using patient level variables which will allow us to assess the association of system level variables such as rural status, and hospital volume on risk adjusted mortality. We will also identify predictors of trauma care access for children. This research foundation will allow for exploratory analysis of county trauma registries to identify quality of care indicators for pediatric trauma care and to determine to what degree outcome disparities are associated with poorer quality of care. My long-term career goal is to translate my clinical experience into scientifically sound epidemiological studies that will directly benefit all children. In addition to completion of this research, this award will allow me to obtain an MPH and broaden my quantitative skills. After this award period, I will continue as an independent investigator to identify disparities in pediatric trauma outcomes, improve the quality of emergency medical care and design community, regional and state-wide system interventions to prevent pediatric trauma, reduce outcome disparities and improve the overall quality of care provided to injured children.           ","Disparities in Pediatric Trauma Outcomes: Context, Access and Quality of Care",7907910,K23HD051595,"['Severities ', ' Side ', ' Award ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Location ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' experience ', ' Risk Adjustment ', ' Calibration ', ' California ', ' skills ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' childhood trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' injured ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Trauma ', ' Trauma Research ', ' population based ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Death Certificates ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Provider ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Planning ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' County Hospitals ', ' Rural Hospitals ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Policies ', ' Development Plans ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Records ', ' Registries ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' trauma centers ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' ']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2010,129991,0.12586673885973085
"Occupational Injuries Among Immigrant Poultry Workers: Development & Progression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  U.S. poultry processing workers experience a disproportionate share of occupational injuries and illness compared to workers in other industries. Recent trends in this industry have resulted in a worker population that is poor, minority, and increasingly comprised of immigrants. Little research documents the onset of occupational injuries among immigrants in the poultry processing industry, the progression of these occupational injuries, or the occupational and personal characteristics associated with these occupational injuries. The overall goal of this research study is to document the nature and sources of occupational injuries among minority poultry processing workers. It follows several years of community participatory research by this team with workers in the target communities, in which a sampling frame has been developed. The specific aims are: (1) to compare the prevalence of selected musculoskeletal (MSDs) and skin disorders among Latino poultry processing workers and controls (non-poultry, Latino manual laborers), and assess the mediating and moderating effects of occupational (task, shift), structural (income, education, access to healthcare), and socio- cultural (ethnicity, beliefs, values, acculturation) factors on these disorders; (2) to document the development of selected MSDs and skin disorders and assess the mediating and moderating effects of occupational, structural, and socio-cultural factors on this development; (3) to delineate the impact of selected MSDs and skin disorders on workers' and controls' health-related quality of life, both cross-sectionally and over time; and (4) to determine the interpretation of occupational illness and injury symptomatology, self-care behaviors, and barriers to prevention, treatment seeking, and reporting among workers. These specific aims will be achieved using a linked cohort and ethnographic design, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods. 276 immigrant poultry workers with experience in processing line work </= 3 yr and 276 controls will be recruited. Data collected will include physical examination, nerve conduction, wrist ultrasound, and interview. 133 disease free new hires and 133 controls will be interviewed again at 6 months, and the complete examination at 12 months. 30 workers who have experienced progressive musculoskeletal injury or dermatological illness will be recruited for in-depth interviews based on an ""explanatory models of illness"" framework.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Poultry processing workers experience high rates of injuries, but good estimates of the number and types of injuries are unavailable. This study will provide such data, as well as information on the causes and consequences of these injuries. Such research will provide the basis of future efforts to reduce disparities in occupational injuries in the fastest growing segment of the meat processing industry through education and enforcement.           Project Narrative Relevance: Poultry processing workers experience high rates of injuries, but good estimates of the number and types of injuries are unavailable.

"Child Safety Seat Intervention for Pacific Northwest Tribes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for American Indian (Al) children, proper use of age-appropriate child restraint systems can substantially reduce the number of fatal injuries, however, many Al children still ride completely unrestrained or improperly restrained when traveling. In a recent vehicle observation study in 6 Northwestern US tribes, the majority of Al children age 8 or under rode un- (41%) or improperly (30%) restrained. While adult drivers in these tribes were commonly unaware of laws regarding vehicle restraints for children, they were receptive to receiving more information and training on proper use of child safety seats. One of the Healthy People 2010 injury prevention goals promotes the widespread and consistent use of child safety seats. Tribes in the Northwest have prioritized injury prevention, in particular, reducing morbidity and mortality from motor vehicles crashes among their membership. It is in response to a resolution passed by the member tribes of the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board that this application was prepared and submitted.      Using a community based participatory research model, our team of partners from Northwest tribes, Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board and Harborview Injury Prevention Center at University of Washington, propose to plan, implement, and evaluate child safety interventions in 6 Northwestern tribal communities. We plan to conduct qualitative interviews and focus groups to determine barriers to appropriate restraint use, work with tribes to design and carry out culturally appropriate interventions, and conduct observational vehicle surveys at three time points over the five years. We propose to use a staggered intervention design, implementing interventions in three tribes at a time, and comparing child passenger restraint use in all six tribes before and after each intervention. Tribes will be involved in every facet of the research process, including interpretation and future planning based on results. We anticipate that well designed, tribe-implemented programs will eliminate barriers, increase knowledge, and result in a sustained increase in child safety seat use.            ",Child Safety Seat Intervention for Pacific Northwest Tribes,7802905,R24MD002763,"['conference ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' injured ', ' community intervention ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' tribal community ', ' tribal communities ', ' Childhood Injury ', ' injury in children ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' 4 year old ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' 8 year old ', ' eight year old ', ' age 8 years ', ' Health behavior change ', ' National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities ', ' NCMHD ', ' northwest tribe ', ' community based participatory research ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Secure ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' motor vehicle injury ', ' injury from motor vehicle accident ', ' injury from car accident ', ' injury due to car accident ', ' car injury ', ' car accident injury ', ' Address ', ' injury prevention ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Reservations ', ' Resolution ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' Community Trial ', ' Process ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' tribal member ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Injury ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' working group ', ' minority health ', ' Area ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Death Rate ', ' Infant ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' knowledge of results ', ' Laws ', ' Funding ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Collaborations ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Pacific Northwest ', ' Parents ', ' restraint ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Seat Belts ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Tribes ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Adopted ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Awareness ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Belief ', ' intervention program ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Toddler ', ' Reporting ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' risk perception ', ' Police ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' symposium ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWEST PORTLAND AREA INDIAN HLTH BD,R24,2010,561617,0.18572331784105459
"Socioeconomic Status and Post-Injury Quality of Life and Functional Ability    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 award will allow the candidate to obtain the training and skills necessary to develop and lead patient-oriented research projects in the field of quality of life and functional outcomes after injury. The aims of the career development plan are for the candidate to acquire core knowledge, to gain further expertise in research methodology, data management and interpretation, and to strengthen his scientific writing, and academic leadership skills. To achieve the career development aims, the candidate will have an interdisciplinary mentor team, will have an in-depth didactic experience, will carry out a mentored research project and will develop future research protocols in his area of interest. The candidate's mentored research plan will utilize the resources of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and guidance of the candidate's mentors (Donna Hathaway, PhD, Andrew Bush, PhD, and Timothy Fabian, MD) to achieve the specific aims of the project. The specific aims are: (1) To determine the relationship between pre-injury socioeconomic status and functional ability following moderate to severe injury; (2) To investigate the association between pre-injury socioeconomic status and quality of life following moderate to severe injury. To address these aims 250 moderately to severely injured persons admitted to the only Level I Trauma Center for a 150-mile radius to Memphis, Tennessee will be followed for one year. Detailed information regarding participants' individual level socioeconomic status and pre-injury quality of life and functional ability will be obtained as close to the time of admission as possible. The specific census tract group in which the participant lives will be determined using geocoding. From this information specific neighborhood level socioeconomic indicators will be determined from Census Data. Over the follow-up period, determinations of functional ability and quality of life will be made. The relationship between pre-injury socioeconomic status on the individual and neighborhood level and post-injury functional ability and quality of life will be determined using hierarchical linear modeling. Because injury touches over 28 million Americans a year from all walks of life, understanding how socioeconomic status influences recovery after injury is critical. Once this relationship is understood, interventions can be designed to ensure that injured people from all walks of life will achieve the highest levels of functional ability and quality of life possible after injury.             ",Socioeconomic Status and Post-Injury Quality of Life and Functional Ability,7847430,K23GM084427,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Future ', ' Injury ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Area ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Phase ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Ensure ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Linear Models ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Development Plans ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' preventative medicine ', ' tool ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Tennessee ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' trauma centers ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Investigation ', ' Writing ', ' Radial ', ' Radius ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' skills training ', ' Surgeon ', ' American ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Touch ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' limb injury ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' County ', ' Walking ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic encephalopathy ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' minority subjects ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' patient population ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,K23,2010,129807,0.10651441037020815
"Skin Elasticity and Skin Color: Understanding Health Disparity in Sexual Assault    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexual assault is a violent event that affects millions of females each year. Of the estimated 6.8 million rapes and physical assaults annually in the U.S., 2.6 million will result in an injury to a women and almost 800,000 will result in the survivor receiving some type of healthcare. Assessment of injuries to the skin resulting from sexual assault is known to play an important role in the health care and criminal justice systems. Recent published findings indicate that women with dark skin who have a forensic examination have a significantly lower genital injury prevalence as compared to women with light skin. These findings, which raise important questions about the relationship of skin elasticity and skin color, may indicate a spurious nature of the relationship between race/ethnicity and injury prevalence. They demonstrated that skin color rather than race/ethnicity is likely the important variable that predicts genital injury prevalence. If women with dark skin are less likely to have injuries detected than women with light skin, a health disparity exists. Little is known about the role of skin elasticity across the continuum of skin colors, and whether or not differences skin elasticity may also explain the findings that injury prevalence varies by skin color.      The overall objective of this pre-doctoral application is to determine if skin elasticity varies by skin color. The applicant proposes an innovative approach to answer the question: Can the previous findings that genital injury prevalence varies by skin color be better understood because skin elasticity varies by skin color? The applicant anticipates that variations in skin elasticity will also be explained by age, body mass index, sun exposure, and health status. The proposed clinical research study and training plan are integral to the applicant's long-term goals, which include elucidation of potential differences in skin physiology related to color and other variables, understanding the protective and injurious mechanisms of the skin, and dissemination of applicable findings to further skin science and reduce health disparities in vulnerable populations.      Results obtained during this study, to take place at the University of Pennsylvania, have potentially large scale public health benefits. Findings will provide information that will influence the procedure for forensic examinations after sexual assault and guidelines for evaluating injuries in a legal setting. If skin elasticity is indeed different in women with different skin colors, addressing these differences may improve techniques for the forensic examination and provide the impetus for increased reporting rates following sexual assault.          ",Skin Elasticity and Skin Color: Understanding Health Disparity in Sexual Assault,7740855,F31NR011106,"['Decubitus ulcer ', ' Pressure Ulcer ', ' Pressure Sore ', ' Bedsore ', ' Bed Sores ', ' Skin ', ' Childbirth ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Legal ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Elasticity ', ' Address ', ' Sun Exposure ', ' sunlight exposure ', ' solar exposure ', ' Detection ', ' Collection ', ' Female ', ' Guidelines ', ' Forearm ', ' Forensic Medicine ', ' Forensics ', ' Affect ', ' Injury ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Au element ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Image Analysis ', ' image evaluation ', ' Image Analyses ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Survivors ', ' Training ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' sexual assault ', ' sexual attack ', ' assaulted sexually ', ' Literature ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Skin tanning ', ' Tanning ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Play ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Forcible intercourse ', ' Rape ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' sacrum ', ' Sacral Bone ', ' Science ', ' Skin Physiology ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Thigh structure ', ' Thigh ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Location ', ' Genital injury ', ' digital imaging ', ' computer imaging ', ' skin color ', ' Agreement ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Reporting ', ' physical assault ', ' physical attack ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Documentation ', ' Coitus ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Color ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2010,41342,0.13669271490225676
"Secondary Injuries among U.S. Workers with Disabilities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are currently 40 to 50 million individuals living with disabilities in the U.S. and the number of adults with disabilities is expected to rise in the coming years. Although studies over the last decade have demonstrated that individuals with disabilities are at a significantly higher risk for nonfatal injuries, much remains to be learned about the risks and patterns of occupational and non-occupational injuries in workers with disabilities. The long-term goal of this project is to study associations between pre-existing disabilities and secondary injuries and to investigate the medical costs and methods of payments among U.S. workers with disabilities. The central hypotheses are (1) that workers with disabilities are at a significantly higher risk for occupational and non-occupational injuries than workers without disabilities, and (2) that the annual costs associated with medical care for these injuries are significantly higher in workers with disabilities. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the relationship between pre-existing disability and secondary injury and identifying injury patterns will allow for the development of better evidence-based policies and safety programs for U.S. workers with disabilities. Thus, the proposed research will help promote the NIOSH mission to address occupational safety and health disparities in special populations. Data from two large representative national surveys - the 1997-2004 National Health Interview Survey, and the 2002-2006 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, will be analyzed to pursue three specific aims: 1) To compare occupational injuries and non-occupational injuries among U.S. workers with and without disabilities; 2) To compare the medical service costs for treating occupational injuries and non- occupational injuries among U.S. workers with and without disabilities; and 3) To compare sources of payments and out-of-pocket expenditures for the medical treatment of occupational injuries and non- occupational injuries among U.S. workers with disabilities and without disabilities. Guided by our strong preliminary data, this study will use several innovative statistical approaches. Association between pre-existing disabilities and occupational injuries and non-occupational injuries will be studied using multivariable logistic regression and Poisson regression models controlling for demographic and socioeconomic injury risk factors. Medical costs of occupational injuries and non- occupational injuries will be compared between U.S. workers with and without disabilities using bootstrap methods and a two-part regression model. Findings from the proposed research could provide much-needed scientific evidence for informing important policy decisions relevant to occupational safety and injury prevention among U.S. workers with disabilities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Both Healthy People 2010 and the 2005 U.S. Surgeon General's Call to Action to Improve the Health and Wellness of Persons with Disabilities identified health promotion and the integration of individuals into the community as national priorities.

In a recent vehicle observation study in 6 Northwestern US tribes, the majority of Al children age 8 or under rode un- (41%) or improperly (30%) restrained. While adult drivers in these tribes were commonly unaware of laws regarding vehicle restraints for children, they were receptive to receiving more information and training on proper use of child safety seats. One of the Healthy People 2010 injury prevention goals promotes the widespread and consistent use of child safety seats. Tribes in the Northwest have prioritized injury prevention, in particular, reducing morbidity and mortality from motor vehicles crashes among their membership. It is in response to a resolution passed by the member tribes of the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board that this application was prepared and submitted.      Using a community based participatory research model, our team of partners from Northwest tribes, Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board and Harborview Injury Prevention Center at University of Washington, propose to plan, implement, and evaluate child safety interventions in 6 Northwestern tribal communities. We plan to conduct qualitative interviews and focus groups to determine barriers to appropriate restraint use, work with tribes to design and carry out culturally appropriate interventions, and conduct observational vehicle surveys at three time points over the five years. We propose to use a staggered intervention design, implementing interventions in three tribes at a time, and comparing child passenger restraint use in all six tribes before and after each intervention. Tribes will be involved in every facet of the research process, including interpretation and future planning based on results. We anticipate that well designed, tribe-implemented programs will eliminate barriers, increase knowledge, and result in a sustained increase in child safety seat use.            ",Child Safety Seat Intervention for Pacific Northwest Tribes,8052924,R24MD002763,"['Parents ', ' member ', ' Training ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Knowledge ', ' Future ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Collaborations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Accounting ', ' Washington ', ' Injury ', ' Area ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' United States ', ' Family ', ' Funding ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Grant ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Data ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' improved ', ' Resolution ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' injured ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' base ', ' Behavioral ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Process ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' knowledge of results ', ' Risk ', ' Research ', ' Age ', ' programs ', ' Health ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' Structure ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' Universities ', ' Reporting ', ' Safety ', ' Goals ', ' Work ', ' Communities ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' response ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Time ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Testing ', ' Childhood Injury ', ' injury in children ', ' Death Rate ', ' risk perception ', ' working group ', ' Pacific Northwest ', ' Toddler ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' community intervention ', ' Tribes ', ' Police ', ' Reservations ', ' northwest tribe ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities ', ' NCMHD ', ' injury prevention ', ' Community Trial ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Infant ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Secure ', ' tribal member ', ' 4 year old ', ' four year old ', ' age 4 years ', ' Adopted ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Travel ', ' community based participatory research ', ' 8 year old ', ' eight year old ', ' age 8 years ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Interview ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Laws ', ' Seat Belts ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Government ', ' minority health ', ' restraint ', ' Belief ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Focus Groups ', ' intervention program ', ' Awareness ', ' tribal community ', ' tribal communities ', ' motor vehicle injury ', ' injury from motor vehicle accident ', ' injury from car accident ', ' injury due to car accident ', ' car injury ', ' car accident injury ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWEST PORTLAND AREA INDIAN HLTH BD,R24,2011,556501,0.18572331784105459
"A Community-Based Trial to Prevent Lead Poisoning and Injuries    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The contribution of residential hazards to children's health is poorly defined, but it is clear that some of the most prevalent disease and disabilities among U.S. children - including injuries and lead poisoning - would decline if such hazards were eliminated. Residential hazards also contribute to social disparities in children's health. This revised community-based participatory research application - a partnership of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital and the National tenter for Healthy Housing - would extend the follow-up of an ongoing 402-person birth cohort (n=358 in the randomized trial) designed to test the efficacy of interventions to control residential hazards in children, from 2 years of age through 5 years. This extension is critical to fully evaluate the efficacy of reducing lead and injury hazards on children's intellectual abilities, behavioral problems and injuries during the peak vulnerability of early childhood. The central hypothesis of this application is that housing interventions will reduce the prevalence of lead toxicity and residential injuries in a racially diverse sample of children. The aims and hypotheses of this application are: 1.0 Determine the efficacy of lead hazard controls on children's blood lead levels and their risk for learning and behavioral problems. 1.1 Levels of lead in dust, soil and water will be significantly lower for housing units in the lead treatment arm compared with the injury control arm at 36, 48 and 60 month home visits. 1.2 Children who are assigned to the lead treatment arm will have lifetime blood lead levels that are >20% lower than children assigned to the injury treatment arm at 5 years. 1.3 Children in the lead treatment arm will have higher IQ scores at 5 years than children in the injury treatment arm. 1.4 Children in the lead treatment arm will have fewer behavioral problems at 5 years, especially measures related to ADHD, than children in the injury treatment arm. 1.5 Higher lead exposure, measured during pregnancy and early childhood using maternal blood, cord blood, meconium and children's blood, is inversely associated with IQ scores and directly associated with behavioral problems at 5 years in children with postnatal maximal blood lead levels < 5 /jg/dL 2.0 Determine the efficacy of comprehensive housing modifications on children's risk for injuries. 2.1 Children who are assigned to a multifactorial, housing intervention to prevent injuries will have 30% fewer unscheduled medical visits for housing injuries compared with children in the lead treatment arm. This is the first trial to test the efficacy of a multifactorial intervention for the primary prevention of two of the most prevalent causes of disease and disability in US children - lead toxicity and residential injuries. If efficacious, policy could be developed to reduce disease and disability linked with these hazards. It would also help resolve the ongoing controversy about the adverse consequences of low-level lead toxicity at blood lead levels previously thought to be safe. Our partnership with the National Center for Healthy Housing will enhance our ability to translate and disseminate the research results to affected communities locally and nationally.             ",A Community-Based Trial to Prevent Lead Poisoning and Injuries,8067852,R01ES014575,"['Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Policies ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Language ', ' postnatal ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Housing ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Schools ', ' Research Proposals ', ' early childhood ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' trial design ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Translating ', ' efficacy testing ', ' skills ', ' Injury ', ' Visit ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modification ', ' Childhood Injury ', ' injury in children ', ' Reading ', ' Americas ', ' African ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ', ' attention deficit hyperactive disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Hyperactivity Disorder ', ' Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type Attention-Deficit Disorder ', ' Hyperkinetic Syndrome ', ' Hyperactivity Disorder NOS ', ' ADHD ', ' AD/HD ', ' Persons ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' arm ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Link ', ' randomized trial ', ' Learning ', ' cohort ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Scientist ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Clinic ', ' high risk ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Attention ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' interest ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Research ', ' Prevalence ', ' base ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Accounting ', ' Age ', ' Outcome ', ' Sampling ', ' Affect ', ' Family ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Safety ', ' disability ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Measures ', ' Medical ', ' Cognitive ', ' Death Rate ', ' social disparities ', ' Data ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' improved ', ' Time ', ' Goals ', ' Collaborations ', ' lead exposure ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' 5 year old ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' House Call ', ' Home Visits ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' safety testing ', ' Home visitation ', ' home visit ', ' Lead Poisoning ', ' toxicity to lead ', ' toxic effect to lead ', ' plumbism ', ' lead toxicity ', ' lead toxic effect ', ' Pb2+ toxic effect ', ' Pb2+ poisoning ', ' Pb2+ lead toxicity ', ' Pb2+ Toxicity ', ' Pb toxic effect ', ' Pb poisoning ', ' Pb lead toxicity ', ' blood Pb concentration ', ' blood lead concentration ', ' Dust ', ' Meconium ', ' Umbilical Cord Blood ', ' fetal cord blood ', ' Cord Blood ', ' Hazard Controls ', ' 2 year old ', ' two year old ', ' age 2 years ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Soil ', ' blood lead ', ' blood Pb ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Health ', ' hazard ', ' motor vehicle injury ', ' injury from motor vehicle accident ', ' injury from car accident ', ' injury due to car accident ', ' car injury ', ' car accident injury ', ' ']",NIEHS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2011,560356,0.2034883002574588
"The UCLA South African Trauma Research Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The UCLA/South African Trauma Training Research (Phodiso) Program seeks five additional years of funding to prepare future investigators to conduct research on trauma exposure and injury prevention in the context of South Africa's high levels of interpersonal and community violence and intentional injuries. The Phodiso Program is an international collaboration between UCLA and the South African Research Consortium (SARC), which includes the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC), North-West University (NWU), and University of Cape Town (UCT) and is based on three NIH-funded projects: 1) The Eban Project, a randomized clinical trial testing a culturally congruent intervention for HIV serodiscordant African American couples (R01; 2001-2011); 2) The Aftermath of Rape Among South African Women (The Fulufhelo Project), a study examining the short and long-term psychosocial sequelae of rape among South African women (R03; 2009-2012); and 3) The HIV/AIDS Translational Training Program (HATT) for racial and ethnic minority postdoctoral Scholars and early career investigators interested in studying HIV/AIDS, mental health and substance abuse and associated co-morbid disparities (R25; 2009-2011). Guided by ecological and social learning theories, the focus of the Phodiso Scholar's research will be to minimize the negative health and mental health effects of trauma exposure, specifically depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in South Africa. Developed over the past five years, our multidisciplinary training program proposes to expand to investigate and train on biologic and genetic markers and mediators of stress and thus, to be a more comprehensive biobehavioral trauma training program. During the initial funding period, eight scholars were trained and will now compose the Technical Advisory Group (TAG). For this renewal, the UCLA and SARC core faculty and TAG will conduct a countrywide application process to select one early career research candidates per year for a two-year postdoctoral fellowship. Scholars will receive research mentorship including a quarter of study (i.e., a 3-month period) at UCLA, one selection and planning meeting and one short-term trauma workshop each year in South Africa. Scholars will conduct their own research projects in South Africa as a basis for future studies in this field, as well as work closely with their SARC host university and TAG mentors. The Phodiso Trauma Training program and the research careers of the scholars will be tracked over time. Specifically, the sustainability of the training program and integration into academic, private, and government-supported agencies and the Scholar's ability to establish and sustain independent research careers will be evaluated and documented. Future goals will include encouraging the South African government to support, endorse and adopt the Phodiso program as a successful and replicable model of cross-cultural trauma research training.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The UCLA/South African Trauma Training Research (Phodiso) Program seeks five additional years of funding to prepare future investigators to conduct research on trauma and injury exposure in the context of South Africa's high levels of interpersonal and community violence and intentional injuries.

"Socioeconomic Status and Post-Injury Quality of Life and Functional Ability    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 award will allow the candidate to obtain the training and skills necessary to develop and lead patient-oriented research projects in the field of quality of life and functional outcomes after injury. The aims of the career development plan are for the candidate to acquire core knowledge, to gain further expertise in research methodology, data management and interpretation, and to strengthen his scientific writing, and academic leadership skills. To achieve the career development aims, the candidate will have an interdisciplinary mentor team, will have an in-depth didactic experience, will carry out a mentored research project and will develop future research protocols in his area of interest. The candidate's mentored research plan will utilize the resources of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and guidance of the candidate's mentors (Donna Hathaway, PhD, Andrew Bush, PhD, and Timothy Fabian, MD) to achieve the specific aims of the project. The specific aims are: (1) To determine the relationship between pre-injury socioeconomic status and functional ability following moderate to severe injury; (2) To investigate the association between pre-injury socioeconomic status and quality of life following moderate to severe injury. To address these aims 250 moderately to severely injured persons admitted to the only Level I Trauma Center for a 150-mile radius to Memphis, Tennessee will be followed for one year. Detailed information regarding participants' individual level socioeconomic status and pre-injury quality of life and functional ability will be obtained as close to the time of admission as possible. The specific census tract group in which the participant lives will be determined using geocoding. From this information specific neighborhood level socioeconomic indicators will be determined from Census Data. Over the follow-up period, determinations of functional ability and quality of life will be made. The relationship between pre-injury socioeconomic status on the individual and neighborhood level and post-injury functional ability and quality of life will be determined using hierarchical linear modeling. Because injury touches over 28 million Americans a year from all walks of life, understanding how socioeconomic status influences recovery after injury is critical. Once this relationship is understood, interventions can be designed to ensure that injured people from all walks of life will achieve the highest levels of functional ability and quality of life possible after injury.             ",Socioeconomic Status and Post-Injury Quality of Life and Functional Ability,8124883,K23GM084427,"['Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Tennessee ', ' Censuses ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' data management ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Radial ', ' Radius ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' skills training ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic encephalopathy ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' Participant ', ' Persons ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Future ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Knowledge ', ' American ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Cities ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Walking ', ' injured ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Linear Models ', ' Economics ', ' Leadership ', ' County ', ' functional outcomes ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' United States ', ' skills ', ' Writing ', ' Recovery ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Country ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Literature ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Mentors ', ' base ', ' social ', ' Goals ', ' Outcome ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Phase ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' patient population ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' interest ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Life ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' improved ', ' Patients ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Ensure ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' career development ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Population ', ' Data ', ' Research ', ' cost ', ' Caring ', ' Area ', ' Age ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' novel ', ' Techniques ', ' Trauma ', ' Universities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Individual ', ' Injury ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' tool ', ' Play ', ' Development Plans ', ' Time ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' trauma centers ', ' limb injury ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' preventative medicine ', ' minority subjects ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,K23,2011,127454,0.10651441037020815
"Colorado Injury Control Research Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The purpose of the Colorado Injury Control Research Center (CICRC) is to participate with communities to reduce injuries, primarily in Public Health Service (PHS) Region VIII.  Core values that govern the activities at the CICRC are:  a primary focus on reducing disparities in the prevention and control of injuries; seeking collaborative relationships with communities; innovation in education/training, community programs and   research; and identification of evidence-based, efficient approaches to prevent of injuries.  The CICRC is located in PHS Region VIII. PHS Region VIII includes Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, Utah and North Dakota. In the region, 23.2% of the population is rural non-farm, and 2.3% are rural farm residents. The population density of each state in the region is significantly lower than the US as a whole; these population densities have important implications for the development of appropriate injury prevention and control strategies in the region.  Death rates from all injuries are higher than US rates in all the states except North Dakota; unintentional injury death rates are higher than US rates in all states except Utah; motor vehicle occupant death rates are higher than US rates in all states except Colorado and Utah; and suicide death rates are higher than US rates in all states in the region.        The specific aims of the CICRC are to: 1) maintain an organizational structure to ensure effective coordination of the CICRC; 2) promote training and education related to injuries and control of injuries; 3) expand existing community based activities in injury control and prevention; 4) utilize existing data to identify injury patterns; 5) increase and diversify funding sources for injury research, community-based programs, education and training; 6)   disseminate information about injury prevention and control; 7) conduct ongoing of the CICRC program; 8) promote the development of new investigators in injury prevention and control research; and 9) conduct high quality, innovative research in acute care, prevention/control, and rehabilitation of injuries.  Public Health Relevance:  The purpose of the center is to reduce the occurrence, severity, and adverse consequences of injuries through research, education, and service.  Emphasis is placed on reducing disparities in injury outcomes through focusing on community partnerships among underserved populations, such as Native Americans, Hispanics and rural residents.          ",Colorado Injury Control Research Center,8123225,R49CE001168,[''],NCIPC,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R49,2011,900618,0.24729928849146565
"Trauma System Evaluation with Survival Time Models    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Proposed Objective and Approach: To determine and evaluate components of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and trauma systems that contribute to improved outcomes for acutely injured persons, using public data and survival-time statistical models. Importance: Injuries are a substantial cause of death and disability, some of which may be prevented by effective EMS and trauma systems. However, evaluation of these systems is complicated by the concentration of medical resources in urban areas, and possibly unavoidable delays in initiating therapy due to geographic disparities. To overcome this methodological problem, we propose using survival-time models that explicitly adjust for the length of time between injury, intervention, and death. Data sources are now available that allow us to apply these innovative methods to make appropriate comparisons among EMS systems, their specific components, and other potentially modifiable factors. Specific Aims and Hypotheses: 1) To construct survival curves for subjects after traffic crashes or intentional injuries, using public data and standard methods of survival-time analysis; 2) To determine the overall effects of EMS and hospital intervention on these curves and models; and 3) After controlling for identifiable fixed factors, to determine how much the effects of EMS and hospital intervention vary among specific trauma systems, and use this residual variability as a measure of individual system performance. Study Design: We will use survival-time modeling techniques to analyze existing data from fatal traffic crashes, homicides, and suicides. Data on time to death following injury will be obtained from the National Vital Statistics System (death certificates), National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Fatality Analysis Reporting System (NHTSA/FARS, a census of fatal crashes), and National Violent Death Reporting System (a census of homicides and suicides). Corresponding populations at risk for death following similar injuries will be identified using FARS (which includes the other persons involved in a fatal crash), the NHTSA State Data System (police crash reports), or State Inpatient Databases (hospitalizations). The onset of EMS or hospital treatment will each be added to standard proportional hazards survival-time models as a time-varying covariate (0 before, 1 after), and we expect to show a decrease in the hazard with EMS and a further decrease with hospital treatment. This will confirm the importance of minimizing response time and prehospital time, and help explain the observed association between rural location and mortality after injury. Finally, each state will be incorporated as a cofactor in the models, allowing us to estimate the residual effect of each specific trauma system, after accounting for the disparities in their geographic settings. These models will be further refined by including the known structure of EMS and trauma systems in the corresponding regions and estimating the effects of specific components. Setting and Participants: Our study population will include injured persons during the two most recently available years from the 25 states that have data in at least four of the five public databases cited above (or the National EMS Information System currently under development). Interventions: None. Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes are survival and time elapsed from injury to death. We will also estimate the effects of EMS and hospital treatment, general characteristics of EMS and trauma systems, and effects of specific regional systems, using coefficients derived from survival-time models.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       This project presents a new opportunity to assemble data already available and apply innovative statistical methods to evaluate trauma systems. This will enable us to distinguish between the impact of level of trauma system development and other factors affecting the disparity in rural and urban trauma mortality.              This project presents a new opportunity to assemble data already available and apply innovative statistical methods to evaluate trauma systems.

"Injury in Latina Women after Sexual Assault:  Moving Toward Health Care Equity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Skin color plays a distinct role in the detection of and perhaps the protection from skin injury in sexual assault. We have found significant differences in ano-genital injury prevalence in Black and White females after consensual sexual intercourse and sexual assault that can be more fully explained by skin color than by race/ethnicity. Little is known about the generalizability of this phenomenon to the largest minority population in the US: Latinos. While major developments in the empirical basis of DNA and toxicology samples have occurred in the past 20 years, the development of empirically-based science in the context of sexual assault has not occurred with respect to injuries. We are proposing to study ano-genital injury prospectively through digital image analysis in 200 Latinas in the U.S. and Puerto Rico following consensual sexual intercourse, and compare their injuries to those documented in medical records of 200 Latinas following sexual assault.

"PBEF Neutralizing Humanized Monoclonal Antibodies As Novel Therapeutic Approaches    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 40-60% of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) require mechanical ventilation with acute lung injury (ALI) a common diagnosis which mandates intubation and placement on the ventilator. It is now well recognized that the development of VILI directly contributes to the unacceptably high mortality rate associated with ALI and despite the advances in ventilation strategies, VILI remains a major problem in ICU. VILI and ALI have common pathological features such as marked pulmonary capillary leakage, increased inflammatory cell influx and enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Currently, the only remedial procedure in place is the use of low tidal volume ventilation, a practice not universally embraced and insufficient to completely prevent VILI. Our previous work has identified PBEF, an inflammatory cytokine that accumulates in the lung fluid as one of the major underlying factors that mediated the damage seen in ALI/VILI. We also carried out proof-of-principle studies to demonstrate that neutralizing polyclonal antibodies against PBEF when administered intratracheally and also intravenously has significant reduction in mouse model of ALI/VILI. We therefore propose to generate humanized ant-PBEF monoclonal antibodies (P- BEFizumab) that can be used as both prophylactic and therapeutic agents in patients with ALI/VILI. Once the credibility of these antibodies in treating patients with ALI/VILI is established, we believe that these antibodies will also be useful in other lung disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders and also in field situations such as the war front and biothreat situations like chemical or neurotoxin poisoning.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute lung injury is an extremely debilitating disease with a high mortality rate (35-40%) and with significant disparities as the elderly, African-descent and Latino patients are particularly susceptible to the ravages of this disease. Patients require mechanical ventilation to overcome severe hypoxia and respiratory failure and unfortunately, it can exacerbate the lung injury. We have shown PBEF as a major contributing factor, and propose to generate therapeutic humanized neutralizing anti-PBEF monoclonal antibodies to treat patients with acute lung injury.          Acute lung injury is an extremely debilitating disease with a high mortality rate (35-40%) and with significant disparities as the elderly, African-descent and Latino patients are particularly susceptible to the ravages of this disease.

"Birth, Muscle Injury and Pelvic Floor Dysfunction This proposal seeks to improve care for the women who suffer the priority health conditions of pelvic floor dysfunction; problems that arise due to women's unique role in giving birth. It addresses the sex disparities that exist in these problems. Each year 3 million women deliver babies and 300,000 women need surgery for pelvic floor dysfunction. A lack of basic understanding of the mechanisms of birth-related injury and recovery during reproductive years and mechanisms of prolapse later in life block efforts to prevent damage, improve recovery, or improve treatment. We seek continued support for a broadly interdisciplinary group of researchers from 4 schools and 2 institutes to that has expedited development of new knowledge needed to improve treatment and prevention.   Project 1: ""Birth Biomechanics"" will test hypotheses concerning basic mechanisms of pelvic floor injury during vaginal birth; the single largest factor in causing pelvic floor dysfunction to identify specific situations may increase or decrease injury risk.   Project 2: ""Injury Recovery"" will identify risk factors associated with levator injury, test the hypothesis that these injuries are, in fact, related to vaginal delivery and determine early predictors of eventual recovery.   Project 3, ""Mechanisms of Posterior Vaginal Prolapse"" will use advanced imaging and deformation analysis to test hypotheses concerning the basic disease mechanisms responsible for posterior vaginal wall prolapse, one of the most common and strongly birth-associated pelvic floor dysfunction.    Core A: Administrative / Human Subjects / Biostatistics core provides project support by recruiting subjects, compiling and analyzing data and protecting subject safety.

"Experiences of Black Trauma Patients: Why are there disparate racial outcomes?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite comparable severity of injury and burden of comorbidities, minority patients experience poorer outcomes from traumatic injuries when compared to their White peers with the same injury, health characteristics, and insurance status. There is evidence of inequities both in injury mortality and in the experiences of survivors. Patients belonging to racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to die after traumatic injury in America's hospitals. Those that survive are less likely to be discharged to comprehensive rehabilitation facilities and describe uncertainty, distrust, and feelings of vulnerability when reflecting upon interaction with trauma care providers. There is a dearth of research that investigates the way that interactional phenomenon (bias, stereotyping, and uncertainty in race-discordant patient-clinician interactions) contributes to the development of these health disparities. Focused descriptive inquiry on the experience of minority trauma patients cared for in America's hospitals is needed to fill this gap. The purpose of this proposed research is to describe the experiences of Black urban trauma patients to understand how and why care practices and clinician-patient interactions might manifest in poorer outcomes among minority patients. A qualitative inquiry, using participant observation and embedded interview, inclusive of both patient and clinician perspectives, will be used to explore these interactional processes throughout the hospitalization experience - from emergency department to hospital discharge. Black trauma patients are selected as the population of interest because they comprise a disproportionately high percentage of minority patients presenting to hospitals for injury treatment. Citing this research in an urban trauma center is ideal because these institutions are often situated in areas of racial and ethnic diversity, designated as centers equipped to treat a large spectrum of injury type and severity, and typically have a higher census of injured patients than smaller non-urban medical centers. With an enhanced understanding of the experiences of Black patients in the urban trauma care system, we will be able to alter processes of care to improve outcomes and test health-promoting interventions designed to: reduce disparities in injury outcomes, prevent re-injury and build positive connections to other health services essential in facilitating an optimal recovery. This research will build the foundation for the applicant's the long term goal of developing a program of research to explore the social, economic and environmental determinants of inequities in injury risk and outcomes, in order to inform interventions aimed at building greater equity in access to and provision of care for the traumatically injured. The goals of this project are well aligned with NINR's priority to reduce an eliminate health disparities.    Despite comparable severity of injury and burden of comorbidities, minority patients experience poorer outcomes from traumatic injuries when compared to their White peers with the same injury, health characteristics, and insurance status. It is essential that the social aspects of trauma care that may contribute to poorer outcomes, including in-hospital processes, are better understood. With an enhanced understanding of the experiences of Black patients in the trauma care system, we will be better positioned to alter processes of care to improve outcomes and test appropriate health-promoting interventions designed to reduce health disparities.",Experiences of Black Trauma Patients: Why are there disparate racial outcomes?,8311376,F31NR013599,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Americas ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' Behavior ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Communication ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' Interview ', ' Judgment ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Societies ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' trauma centers ', ' United States ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Survivors ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Research Activity ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Inferior ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' recidivism ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' American College of Surgeons ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' health literacy ', ' injured ', ' care systems ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' burden of injury ', ' trauma care ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2012,42232,0.2153779977646442
"Socioeconomic Status and Post-Injury Quality of Life and Functional Ability    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K23 award will allow the candidate to obtain the training and skills necessary to develop and lead patient-oriented research projects in the field of quality of life and functional outcomes after injury. The aims of the career development plan are for the candidate to acquire core knowledge, to gain further expertise in research methodology, data management and interpretation, and to strengthen his scientific writing, and academic leadership skills. To achieve the career development aims, the candidate will have an interdisciplinary mentor team, will have an in-depth didactic experience, will carry out a mentored research project and will develop future research protocols in his area of interest. The candidate's mentored research plan will utilize the resources of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and guidance of the candidate's mentors (Donna Hathaway, PhD, Andrew Bush, PhD, and Timothy Fabian, MD) to achieve the specific aims of the project. The specific aims are: (1) To determine the relationship between pre-injury socioeconomic status and functional ability following moderate to severe injury; (2) To investigate the association between pre-injury socioeconomic status and quality of life following moderate to severe injury. To address these aims 250 moderately to severely injured persons admitted to the only Level I Trauma Center for a 150-mile radius to Memphis, Tennessee will be followed for one year. Detailed information regarding participants' individual level socioeconomic status and pre-injury quality of life and functional ability will be obtained as close to the time of admission as possible. The specific census tract group in which the participant lives will be determined using geocoding. From this information specific neighborhood level socioeconomic indicators will be determined from Census Data. Over the follow-up period, determinations of functional ability and quality of life will be made. The relationship between pre-injury socioeconomic status on the individual and neighborhood level and post-injury functional ability and quality of life will be determined using hierarchical linear modeling. Because injury touches over 28 million Americans a year from all walks of life, understanding how socioeconomic status influences recovery after injury is critical. Once this relationship is understood, interventions can be designed to ensure that injured people from all walks of life will achieve the highest levels of functional ability and quality of life possible after injury.

"Injury in Latina Women after Sexual Assault:  Moving Toward Health Care Equity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Skin color plays a distinct role in the detection of and perhaps the protection from skin injury in sexual assault. We have found significant differences in ano-genital injury prevalence in Black and White females after consensual sexual intercourse and sexual assault that can be more fully explained by skin color than by race/ethnicity. Little is known about the generalizability of this phenomenon to the largest minority population in the US: Latinos. While major developments in the empirical basis of DNA and toxicology samples have occurred in the past 20 years, the development of empirically-based science in the context of sexual assault has not occurred with respect to injuries. We are proposing to study ano-genital injury prospectively through digital image analysis in 200 Latinas in the U.S. and Puerto Rico following consensual sexual intercourse, and compare their injuries to those documented in medical records of 200 Latinas following sexual assault. We will combine these data with a sample of predominantly Black and White women (n=800) and analyze approximately 36,000 digital images from consensual participants and records of sexual assault victims (N=1,200) to achieve the following aims: 1) determine prevalence, frequency, and severity of intercourse- related ano-genital injuries in consensual participants and sexual assault victims; 2) determine if sexual assault victims have more discrete digital image characteristics than women who have had consensual sexual intercourse (e.g., larger area of injury, better-defined shape, more localized location, texture more distinct from adjacent areas, more redness than adjacent areas); 3) determine if previously reported differences in the prevalence, frequency, and severity of intercourse-related ano-genital injury between racial/ethnic groups will be accounted for by quantification of skin color; 4) investigate if ano-genital injuries significantly vary as a function of skin mechanics (skin elasticity and skin hydration) and factors that could potentially determine the overall health of epidermal tissue (age, body mass index, sun exposure, and health status); 5) identify the constellation of ano-genital injury type and location, socio-demographic, and intercourse-related variables that most effectively differentiates those who experienced consensual intercourse versus sexual assault.

"Secondary Injuries among U.S. Workers with Disabilities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are currently 40 to 50 million individuals living with disabilities in the U.S. and the number of adults with disabilities is expected to rise in the coming years. Although studies over the last decade have demonstrated that individuals with disabilities are at a significantly higher risk for nonfatal injuries, much remains to be learned about the risks and patterns of occupational and non-occupational injuries in workers with disabilities. The long-term goal of this project is to study associations between pre-existing disabilities and secondary injuries and to investigate the medical costs and methods of payments among U.S. workers with disabilities. The central hypotheses are (1) that workers with disabilities are at a significantly higher risk for occupational and non-occupational injuries than workers without disabilities, and (2) that the annual costs associated with medical care for these injuries are significantly higher in workers with disabilities. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the relationship between pre-existing disability and secondary injury and identifying injury patterns will allow for the development of better evidence-based policies and safety programs for U.S. workers with disabilities. Thus, the proposed research will help promote the NIOSH mission to address occupational safety and health disparities in special populations. Data from two large representative national surveys - the 1997-2004 National Health Interview Survey, and the 2002-2006 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, will be analyzed to pursue three specific aims: 1) To compare occupational injuries and non-occupational injuries among U.S. workers with and without disabilities; 2) To compare the medical service costs for treating occupational injuries and non- occupational injuries among U.S. workers with and without disabilities; and 3) To compare sources of payments and out-of-pocket expenditures for the medical treatment of occupational injuries and non- occupational injuries among U.S. workers with disabilities and without disabilities. Guided by our strong preliminary data, this study will use several innovative statistical approaches.

"Evaluating a Web-based Child Passenger Safety Program:  Safety in Seconds v 2.0    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is a revision of 1RO1HD069221. We are addressing the need for innovative research on prevention in the context of emergency medical services, specifically evaluation of behavior change interventions using computer technology. We propose to test a web based, theory driven, computer-tailored intervention for child passenger safety in two Pediatric Emergency Departments (PEDs) and a Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Service (PTS) that serve diverse populations. The focus of this proposal is on parents' use of child restraint devices (CRDs) -- Car Safety Seats (CSS) and Belt-Positioning Booster Seats (BPBS) -- for their children ages 8 years and younger. These safety behaviors were chosen because they are effective countermeasures known to help prevent motor vehicle occupant injuries, the leading cause of child mortality in the United States. Although CSS use with younger children is common, there are disparities across populations, BPBS use for older children is low, and misuse of CRDs is widespread.  Our previous work, including the NICHD-funded study of Safety in Seconds (SIS) and that of others, has demonstrated that computer-tailored interventions can be feasible and effective in clinical settings, including PEDs. However, our work is the only research to our knowledge applying this technology to the specific issues of CSS and BPBS and the first to use it with Spanish speaking families. The original SIS was a kiosk-based, computer tailored program that demonstrated some success in a low income, urban, and predominantly African-American population in a single PED. This proposal will test an enhanced web-based program, Safety in Seconds v 2.0 (SIS v2.0), with English and Spanish speaking families from Baltimore, MD and Little Rock, AR. We will also extend our prior work by adding several elements never previously considered: testing the program in a PTS; testing a Spanish language version; and adding text messaging reminders and a web portal that can be accessed multiple times to reinforce the educational messages. Evaluating the program's cost benefit and determining barriers and facilitators to program adoption and implementation are also innovative aspects of the proposed work that will contribute to future dissemination.  The specific aims of the study are to: 1) evaluate the impact of a web-based, tailored program on English and Spanish speaking parents' child passenger safety knowledge, prevention beliefs, and the proper and consistent use of CSS and BPBS for their children ages 0-8; 2) evaluate the cost benefit ratio of the program for parents' utilization of BPBS for their children; and 3) determine the barriers and facilitators to program adoption and implementation in both PED and PTS settings. This 5-year study will take place in the Johns Hopkins PED (JH-PED) and the Johns Hopkins PTS (JH-PTS) as well as in the Arkansas Children's Hospital PED (AR-PED). Methods include: a) a modification of the existing Safety in Seconds program to convert it to a web-based platform and incorporate additional video, audio, texting reminders and repeat visit capabilities; b) a randomized controlled trial with 1,650 parents (600 JH-PED, 450 JH-PTS, 600 AR-PED), including baseline and 6-month follow up assessments and CSS observations; c) a cost benefit analysis of the program's expected financial benefit from the perspective of a third party payer of medical claims; and d) an in-depth examination of program adoption and implementation in all three study settings using qualitative data collected from key informant interviews, direct observations of the clinic environments, and document review.  With the ever-growing access to computers, results of this work will have widespread utility for disseminating effective CSS and BPBS behavior change programs to a broad audience, and we will advance the application of computer tailoring theories and methods in a new area.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will evaluate an innovative web-based program -- Safety in Seconds v 2.0 - to increase the proper and consistent use of Car Safety Seats and Belt-Positioning Booster Seats for children ages 8 years and younger. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for children and child restraint devices are proven to reduce the risk of death and injury. The program will be evaluated in pediatric emergency departments and a pediatric trauma center with both English and Spanish speaking families. We will also complete a cost benefit analysis of the program and a study of how to implement the program in other settings.           This proposal will evaluate an innovative web-based program -- Safety in Seconds v 2.0 - to increase the proper and consistent use of Car Safety Seats and Belt-Positioning Booster Seats for children ages 8 years and younger.

"The UCLA South African Trauma Research Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The UCLA/South African Trauma Training Research (Phodiso) Program seeks five additional years of funding to prepare future investigators to conduct research on trauma exposure and injury prevention in the context of South Africa's high levels of interpersonal and community violence and intentional injuries. The Phodiso Program is an international collaboration between UCLA and the South African Research Consortium (SARC), which includes the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC), North-West University (NWU), and University of Cape Town (UCT) and is based on three NIH-funded projects: 1) The Eban Project, a randomized clinical trial testing a culturally congruent intervention for HIV serodiscordant African American couples (R01; 2001-2011); 2) The Aftermath of Rape Among South African Women (The Fulufhelo Project), a study examining the short and long-term psychosocial sequelae of rape among South African women (R03; 2009-2012); and 3) The HIV/AIDS Translational Training Program (HATT) for racial and ethnic minority postdoctoral Scholars and early career investigators interested in studying HIV/AIDS, mental health and substance abuse and associated co-morbid disparities (R25; 2009-2011). Guided by ecological and social learning theories, the focus of the Phodiso Scholar's research will be to minimize the negative health and mental health effects of trauma exposure, specifically depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in South Africa. Developed over the past five years, our multidisciplinary training program proposes to expand to investigate and train on biologic and genetic markers and mediators of stress and thus, to be a more comprehensive biobehavioral trauma training program. During the initial funding period, eight scholars were trained and will now compose the Technical Advisory Group (TAG). For this renewal, the UCLA and SARC core faculty and TAG will conduct a countrywide application process to select one early career research candidates per year for a two-year postdoctoral fellowship. Scholars will receive research mentorship including a quarter of study (i.e., a 3-month period) at UCLA, one selection and planning meeting and one short-term trauma workshop each year in South Africa. Scholars will conduct their own research projects in South Africa as a basis for future studies in this field, as well as work closely with their SARC host university and TAG mentors. The Phodiso Trauma Training program and the research careers of the scholars will be tracked over time. Specifically, the sustainability of the training program and integration into academic, private, and government-supported agencies and the Scholar's ability to establish and sustain independent research careers will be evaluated and documented. Future goals will include encouraging the South African government to support, endorse and adopt the Phodiso program as a successful and replicable model of cross-cultural trauma research training.

"Child Safety Seat Intervention for Pacific Northwest Tribes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for American Indian (Al) children, proper use of age-appropriate child restraint systems can substantially reduce the number of fatal injuries, however, many Al children still ride completely unrestrained or improperly restrained when traveling. In a recent vehicle observation study in 6 Northwestern US tribes, the majority of Al children age 8 or under rode un- (41%) or improperly (30%) restrained. While adult drivers in these tribes were commonly unaware of laws regarding vehicle restraints for children, they were receptive to receiving more information and training on proper use of child safety seats. One of the Healthy People 2010 injury prevention goals promotes the widespread and consistent use of child safety seats. Tribes in the Northwest have prioritized injury prevention, in particular, reducing morbidity and mortality from motor vehicles crashes among their membership. It is in response to a resolution passed by the member tribes of the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board that this application was prepared and submitted.      Using a community based participatory research model, our team of partners from Northwest tribes, Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board and Harborview Injury Prevention Center at University of Washington, propose to plan, implement, and evaluate child safety interventions in 6 Northwestern tribal communities. We plan to conduct qualitative interviews and focus groups to determine barriers to appropriate restraint use, work with tribes to design and carry out culturally appropriate interventions, and conduct observational vehicle surveys at three time points over the five years. We propose to use a staggered intervention design, implementing interventions in three tribes at a time, and comparing child passenger restraint use in all six tribes before and after each intervention. Tribes will be involved in every facet of the research process, including interpretation and future planning based on results. We anticipate that well designed, tribe-implemented programs will eliminate barriers, increase knowledge, and result in a sustained increase in child safety seat use.

"Community Partnerships for Child Safety    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Providing healthy and safe homes and reducing injuries are included in our nation's public health objectives. Access to safety products and knowledge about injury prevention, as well as substandard neighborhood conditions are significant barriers to child safety faced by resource poor communities. This proposal is a revision of one submitted in May, 2006. We seek to prevent injuries in East Baltimore by building on ongoing community work: a) Johns Hopkins CARES (Children ARE Safe) mobile resource center; b) Baltimore City Fire Department neighborhood sweeps; c) Center for Community Health community health worker outreach program; and d) Environmental Justice Board academic-community partnership. We will demonstrate the impact of neighborhood sweeps, the mobile safety center, and community health workers (CHWs) on safety and health. During sweeps, fire inspectors go door-to-door providing free smoke alarms, identifying fire and safety hazards in the home and in the neighborhood, and reporting hazards for remediation. We will enhance these sweeps by working with CHWs and making the CARES mobile safety center available. The center is a 40-foot vehicle with fun, interactive educational exhibits, which will offer families additional low cost safety products. We will compare communities receiving these enhanced sweeps to communities that receive the fire departments standard sweeps. The evaluation design includes surveying randomly selected households in the randomly assigned participating communities before the sweeps begin and after they conclude. We will also enroll cohorts of families at the time of the door-to-door sweeps to collect baseline and follow -up data. We will supplement self-reported data on safety knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors with observations of home and neighborhood fire and safety hazards and data on emergency department visits. We will use qualitative research methods to assess the roles and impacts of the partners on development of the study, implementation of the proposed interventions, and dissemination of results. Results will be widely disseminated by our community partner organizations and through the scholarly literature. Results will contribute new knowledge about reducing health disparities in injury and the utility of community partnerships for promoting home for children and families living in low income, urban environments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project involves a community partnership to promote fire and life safety among low income urban families. We will use door to door canvassing by fire department personnel and community health workers along with a mobile safety center.

"Psychological Effects of Injuries in Urban Black Men: A Disparate Health Issue     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application responds to PA-10-236: Health Promotion in Ethnic and Racial Minority Men with a focus on injury as a flashpoint from which interventions can be introduced to improve health and reduce disparity in urban black men. Although an acute event, injury is a known portal to significant long-term health problems.  The risk of sustaining a recurrent injury is as high as 40 percent, and being black itself is an independent risk factor for recidivism. The psychological effects of injury are substantial and often unrecognized: 20-56 percent develops depression and 20 percent develop post-traumatic stress (PTS) and they exacerbate the risk of injury recidivism. To improve the ability to recognize post-injury depression and PTS in black men, a comprehensive conceptual framework guides this investigation to understand the risk and protective factors that are borne by the intersection of class, race, and location. To this end, this study will innovatively assess lifetime accumulation of risk and protective factors at the personal and institutional levels, incorporate environmental data using geographic information systems, and will link these rich data to acute peri-traumatic subjective experiences.  Doing so will enable more accurate identification of black men who will develop post-injury depression or PTS, and thereby capitalize on injury as a point of intervention to mitigate negative health outcomes. Given that black men have high exposure to stressors, are more likely to be hospitalized for injury in urban settings, are more likely to have psychological consequences, but are less likely to have psychiatric disorders diagnosed than whites, steps must be taken to address this health disparity. Symptoms typically surface after discharge, making it imperative to develop an empirically based risk stratification system to focus limited resources on black men most likely to need follow-up care. In response, the goals of this study are to a) create a risk profile for the emergence of post-injury depression or persistence of PTS by having accurately measured the unique contributions of personal, institutional, environmental risk and protective factors, and peri-traumatic subjective experiences, and 2) complement those findings with participants' expressions of their personal experiences.  This will be accomplished by enrolling a cohort of 900 urban black men who are hospitalized for injury and followed for 3 months post-discharge to measure the primary outcomes: depression and PTS. The specific  aims of this mixed-methods study are to: 1) evaluate and refine a model elucidating the interplay among peri- traumatic subjective experiences, risk factors, and protective factors that best predicts depression and PTS in  black men after traumatic injury~ 2) evaluate the predictive ability of two established, short clinical screeners to  predict the future development of post-injury depression and PTS and examine whether predictive  performance could be improved by including the novel risk and protective factors this study will obtain~ and 3)  gain a richer understanding of black men's experiences, to elucidate strategies used that enhance or detract  from their emotional recovery and their attitudes towards seeking help for psychological symptoms after injury.                            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Black men in urban areas are at high risk for injury and to develop depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms after injury.

"Prevention Program to Reduce Injury Disparities Among Latino Day Laborers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latino day laborers (LDL) experience a disproportionately high rate of on-the-job injuries and fatalities compared with other workers in the U.S. The typical LDL is male, foreign-born, living below the poverty level and Spanish monolingual. In Texas, where most construction workers are LDL, 89 construction workers died on the job in 2010 - a rate of one death every 4 days. Some studies suggest that their injury rate may in fact be 3 to 4 times higher. Safety programs recommended for LDL have had limited success increasing their safety at work, partly because they do not consider the pressing needs confronted by these workers. These programs may have missed a critical component of injury prevention by failing to address psychosocial stressors that emerge from harsh living conditions and economic inequalities which amplify LDL risk for injury at work. Until safety programs are created to help LDL negotiate the hazards they face at work in the context of the psychosocial factors that amplify their risk, it will not be possible to effectively reduce the unacceptably hig risk LDL face of being injured or dying on the job. We are joining forces with our community partners to form a Community Advisory Board (CAB) consisting of day labor leaders, university-based researchers, and community-based and employer organizations to address this question: How can LDL increase their ability to effectively cope with the psychosocial factors that put them at increased risk of unintended injury at work? This study has the following aims: (1) Identify intervention priorities using a corner-based needs assessment to document occupational and psychosocial risk and protective factors that increase LDL risk for injury. (2) With the CAB, jointly design a culturally responsive and context appropriate OSHA 10-based safety intervention that also addresses psychosocial risks to reduce LDL injuries. (3) Collaboratively pilot a corner-level intervention and conduct an evaluation to assess the safety program's feasibility and acceptability as determined by the extent to which we can recruit, retain and follow-up LDL over the course of the study. Mitigating safety risks among LDL is an urgent public health priority to reduce unintended injuries, an area of research interest at the national Institute of Minority Health Disparities.         RELEVANCE (See instructions): This study will develop an intervention to increase safety practices among Latino day laborers. A needs assessment survey with this population will lead to modifications of the OSHA10 (a program recommended for Latino workers) based on priorities to target psychosocial factors that amplify risky conditions at work.

"The impact of pediatric trauma centers on the outcome of injured children in Ohio     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic injury is a significant threat to our nation's children, having a higher mortality rate than all other causes of death combined. The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma states that injured children have special needs that ""may be optimally provided [for] in the environment of a children's hospital with a demonstrated commitment to trauma care."" However, only a small proportion of acute care hospitals are characterized as trauma centers (TC), and even fewer are pediatric trauma centers (PTC). The large number of injured children, compared to the relative scarcity of PTCs, dictates that injured children will be cared for in a variety of hospital settings. Large TCs, including PTCs, are generally located in urban settings with a high population density. This creates a health disparity, leaving children in rural settings at a disadvantage and more vulnerable to poor outcomes from severe trauma. We cannot fully understand the magnitude and scope of pediatric trauma by state, region or nationally until we begin to analyze data collected from non-trauma centers as part of a statewide system. Because most injured children are treated in centers that lack trauma center designation and do not consistently, if at all, report trauma-related data, there is a significant gap in knowledge about this health disparity regarding the volume, treatments, and outcomes of injured children. The proposed project takes a critical step to address this current gap in research by analyzing data from the Ohio Trauma Registry, which captures data from approximately 87% of Ohio hospitals, as required by law, including 138 non-trauma centers (NTC). A total of 19,187 pediatric patients, over a 5-year period, will be analyzed to evaluate in-hospital mortality, length of stay, operations and complications by relevant covariates. Patients transferred from scene to an NTC, in the state of Ohio will be compared to those transferred directly from scene to a designated TC. This will provide valuable information about statewide pediatric injury rates, based on population density and where they are initially transported (via EMS or self- transport). Importantly, 58% of the traumatically injured pediatric patients in the Ohio trauma registry in the year 2010 were transferred from a hospital emergency department to another hospital. The outcomes of transferred patients may be confounded, as the patients may be more severely injured and have longer delays to appropriate specialized care. Therefore, we will analyze this group separately and include a calculated variable describing time since injury. Maps of injury burden, resources and access will be generated. We will estimate both distance traveled and time elapsed between injury and admission to the final point of care to characterize the relationship between rurality and treatment of pediatric trauma. At the end of the project, we expect to have a more thorough understanding of the magnitude of pediatric trauma and health disparities, especially in rural areas. Maps of injury burden, resources and access will be generated. The results of the analysis will reflect a statewide representation of where children are injured, where they first receive care and a characterization of patients who require inter-facility transport. This study wil provide a statewide perspective on the magnitude of the pediatric rural health disparity, and inform a future in-depth, prospective national study.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Traumatic injury is a significant threat to our nation's children, having a higher mortality rate than all other causes of death combined.

"Evaluating a Web-based Child Passenger Safety Program:  Safety in Seconds v 2.0    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is a revision of 1RO1HD069221. We are addressing the need for innovative research on prevention in the context of emergency medical services, specifically evaluation of behavior change interventions using computer technology. We propose to test a web based, theory driven, computer-tailored intervention for child passenger safety in two Pediatric Emergency Departments (PEDs) and a Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Service (PTS) that serve diverse populations. The focus of this proposal is on parents' use of child restraint devices (CRDs) -- Car Safety Seats (CSS) and Belt-Positioning Booster Seats (BPBS) -- for their children ages 8 years and younger. These safety behaviors were chosen because they are effective countermeasures known to help prevent motor vehicle occupant injuries, the leading cause of child mortality in the United States. Although CSS use with younger children is common, there are disparities across populations, BPBS use for older children is low, and misuse of CRDs is widespread.  Our previous work, including the NICHD-funded study of Safety in Seconds (SIS) and that of others, has demonstrated that computer-tailored interventions can be feasible and effective in clinical settings, including PEDs. However, our work is the only research to our knowledge applying this technology to the specific issues of CSS and BPBS and the first to use it with Spanish speaking families. The original SIS was a kiosk-based, computer tailored program that demonstrated some success in a low income, urban, and predominantly African-American population in a single PED. This proposal will test an enhanced web-based program, Safety in Seconds v 2.0 (SIS v2.0), with English and Spanish speaking families from Baltimore, MD and Little Rock, AR. We will also extend our prior work by adding several elements never previously considered: testing the program in a PTS; testing a Spanish language version; and adding text messaging reminders and a web portal that can be accessed multiple times to reinforce the educational messages. Evaluating the program's cost benefit and determining barriers and facilitators to program adoption and implementation are also innovative aspects of the proposed work that will contribute to future dissemination.  The specific aims of the study are to: 1) evaluate the impact of a web-based, tailored program on English and Spanish speaking parents' child passenger safety knowledge, prevention beliefs, and the proper and consistent use of CSS and BPBS for their children ages 0-8; 2) evaluate the cost benefit ratio of the program for parents' utilization of BPBS for their children; and 3) determine the barriers and facilitators to program adoption and implementation in both PED and PTS settings. This 5-year study will take place in the Johns Hopkins PED (JH-PED) and the Johns Hopkins PTS (JH-PTS) as well as in the Arkansas Children's Hospital PED (AR-PED). Methods include: a) a modification of the existing Safety in Seconds program to convert it to a web-based platform and incorporate additional video, audio, texting reminders and repeat visit capabilities; b) a randomized controlled trial with 1,650 parents (600 JH-PED, 450 JH-PTS, 600 AR-PED), including baseline and 6-month follow up assessments and CSS observations; c) a cost benefit analysis of the program's expected financial benefit from the perspective of a third party payer of medical claims; and d) an in-depth examination of program adoption and implementation in all three study settings using qualitative data collected from key informant interviews, direct observations of the clinic environments, and document review.  With the ever-growing access to computers, results of this work will have widespread utility for disseminating effective CSS and BPBS behavior change programs to a broad audience, and we will advance the application of computer tailoring theories and methods in a new area.        This proposal will evaluate an innovative web-based program -- Safety in Seconds v 2.0 - to increase the proper and consistent use of Car Safety Seats and Belt-Positioning Booster Seats for children ages 8 years and younger. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for children and child restraint devices are proven to reduce the risk of death and injury.

"Expressive Writing Intervention for PTSD Prevention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R34 pilot intervention application seeks funds to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of a novel intervention aimed at preventing the development of posttraumatic stress disorder in adult survivors of serious physical injury. The intervention, which involves written self-disclosure, is derived from basic social psychological laboratory research, and will be translated for use as an applied tool in the context of post- trauma hospitalization aftercare. The planned evaluation will recruit patients drawn from a large trauma center that provides services to a predominantly Hispanic and low SES community. The scientific literature suggests that this community may have particular need for novel interventions directed at preventing the development of trauma-related psychopathology. Study participants (N = 106) at risk for developing PTSD would be recruited during hospitalization for treatment of physical injury, and randomly assigned to participate in one of two writing conditions: written emotional disclosure (N = 53) or a control condition in which participants write about mundane topics (N = 53).  The overarching objective of the planned research is to collect information needed to determine the feasibility and potential merit of mounting a full-scale study of writing interventions as strategies to prevent the development of PTSD in physical trauma survivors.  The specific aims of this study are: (1) to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, acceptability, and safety of the writing interventions; (2) to provide a preliminary evaluation as to whether the writing intervention possesses promise as  strategy for preventing the development of PTSD in physical trauma survivors; (3) to assess the importance of age, education, reading level, and acculturation as possible moderators  of the impact of the intervention on mental health outcomes; and (4) to examine possible mechanisms by which the writing interventions may exert their impact on mental  health outcomes.  If the results of this pilot study and the subsequent full-scale intervention prove successful, then trauma center service providers would have a versatile, low cost, and easily accessible tool to offer to physical injury survivors at risk for trauma-related psychopathology. This tool may be particularly useful for economically- disadvantaged Hispanic survivors who may choose not to avail themselves of formal mental health services. Knowledge derived from this randomized controlled trial regarding possible moderators and mediators of treatment efficacy can contribute to the development of more efficacious interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of a self-administrable and short writing intervention aimed at preventing the development of posttraumatic stress disorder in adult survivors of serious physical injury. Survivors of serious injury are at risk for PTSD in the weeks and months following injury, yet few seek mental health services. The writing interventions are not intended to replace proven approaches to treating or preventing mental health problems but their low cost and easy accessibility may address documented barriers to receiving more formal mental health services.                ",Expressive Writing Intervention for PTSD Prevention,8582020,R34MH099237,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Age ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Literature ', ' Medical Records ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Physiological Monitoring ', ' Physiologic Monitoring ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Reading ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Self Disclosure ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Translating ', ' trauma centers ', ' Caucasians ', ' Writing ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Survivors ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Severities ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Physical Sufferings ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' expressive writing therapy ', ' expressive writing ', ' self-disclosure ', ' emotional disclosure ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Trauma ', ' public health relevance ', ' health inequalities ', ' ']",NIMH,RAND CORPORATION,R34,2013,312852,0.05063344190871937
"The UCLA South African Trauma Research Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The UCLA/South African Trauma Training Research (Phodiso) Program seeks five additional years of funding to prepare future investigators to conduct research on trauma exposure and injury prevention in the context of South Africa's high levels of interpersonal and community violence and intentional injuries. The Phodiso Program is an international collaboration between UCLA and the South African Research Consortium (SARC), which includes the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC), North-West University (NWU), and University of Cape Town (UCT) and is based on three NIH-funded projects: 1) The Eban Project, a randomized clinical trial testing a culturally congruent intervention for HIV serodiscordant African American couples (R01; 2001-2011); 2) The Aftermath of Rape Among South African Women (The Fulufhelo Project), a study examining the short and long-term psychosocial sequelae of rape among South African women (R03; 2009-2012); and 3) The HIV/AIDS Translational Training Program (HATT) for racial and ethnic minority postdoctoral Scholars and early career investigators interested in studying HIV/AIDS, mental health and substance abuse and associated co-morbid disparities (R25; 2009-2011). Guided by ecological and social learning theories, the focus of the Phodiso Scholar's research will be to minimize the negative health and mental health effects of trauma exposure, specifically depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in South Africa. Developed over the past five years, our multidisciplinary training program proposes to expand to investigate and train on biologic and genetic markers and mediators of stress and thus, to be a more comprehensive biobehavioral trauma training program. During the initial funding period, eight scholars were trained and will now compose the Technical Advisory Group (TAG). For this renewal, the UCLA and SARC core faculty and TAG will conduct a countrywide application process to select one early career research candidates per year for a two-year postdoctoral fellowship. Scholars will receive research mentorship including a quarter of study (i.e., a 3-month period) at UCLA, one selection and planning meeting and one short-term trauma workshop each year in South Africa. Scholars will conduct their own research projects in South Africa as a basis for future studies in this field, as well as work closely with their SARC host university and TAG mentors. The Phodiso Trauma Training program and the research careers of the scholars will be tracked over time. Specifically, the sustainability of the training program and integration into academic, private, and government-supported agencies and the Scholar's ability to establish and sustain independent research careers will be evaluated and documented. Future goals will include encouraging the South African government to support, endorse and adopt the Phodiso program as a successful and replicable model of cross-cultural trauma research training.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The UCLA/South African Trauma Training Research (Phodiso) Program seeks five additional years of funding to prepare future investigators to conduct research on trauma and injury exposure in the context of South Africa's high levels of interpersonal and community violence and intentional injuries. As an international collaboration between UCLA and the South African Research Consortium (SARC), which includes the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC), North-West University (NWU), and University of Cape Town (UCT), Phodiso's public health mission is to: 1) Increase the number of well-trained South African trauma researchers; 2) Translate research findings to culturally congruent trauma and injury prevention and treatment programs and; 3) Facilitate building of community capacity and infrastructure that benefit the people of South Africa.

"Injury in Latina Women after Sexual Assault:  Moving Toward Health Care Equity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Skin color plays a distinct role in the detection of and perhaps the protection from skin injury in sexual assault. We have found significant differences in ano-genital injury prevalence in Black and White females after consensual sexual intercourse and sexual assault that can be more fully explained by skin color than by race/ethnicity. Little is known about the generalizability of this phenomenon to the largest minority population in the US: Latinos. While major developments in the empirical basis of DNA and toxicology samples have occurred in the past 20 years, the development of empirically-based science in the context of sexual assault has not occurred with respect to injuries. We are proposing to study ano-genital injury prospectively through digital image analysis in 200 Latinas in the U.S. and Puerto Rico following consensual sexual intercourse, and compare their injuries to those documented in medical records of 200 Latinas following sexual assault. We will combine these data with a sample of predominantly Black and White women (n=800) and analyze approximately 36,000 digital images from consensual participants and records of sexual assault victims (N=1,200) to achieve the following aims: 1) determine prevalence, frequency, and severity of intercourse- related ano-genital injuries in consensual participants and sexual assault victims; 2) determine if sexual assault victims have more discrete digital image characteristics than women who have had consensual sexual intercourse (e.g., larger area of injury, better-defined shape, more localized location, texture more distinct from adjacent areas, more redness than adjacent areas); 3) determine if previously reported differences in the prevalence, frequency, and severity of intercourse-related ano-genital injury between racial/ethnic groups will be accounted for by quantification of skin color; 4) investigate if ano-genital injuries significantly vary as a function of skin mechanics (skin elasticity and skin hydration) and factors that could potentially determine the overall health of epidermal tissue (age, body mass index, sun exposure, and health status); 5) identify the constellation of ano-genital injury type and location, socio-demographic, and intercourse-related variables that most effectively differentiates those who experienced consensual intercourse versus sexual assault.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Forensic documentation of ano-genital injuries influences decision-making throughout the criminal justice process, especially at pivotal gate-keeping stages from victim reporting to sentencing. The forensic exam used to collect evidence after rape needs to be equally sensitive for females with dark skin as well as females with light skin.

"Experiences of Black Trauma Patients: Why are there disparate racial outcomes?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite comparable severity of injury and burden of comorbidities, minority patients experience poorer outcomes from traumatic injuries when compared to their White peers with the same injury, health characteristics, and insurance status. There is evidence of inequities both in injury mortality and in the experiences of survivors. Patients belonging to racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to die after traumatic injury in America's hospitals. Those that survive are less likely to be discharged to comprehensive rehabilitation facilities and describe uncertainty, distrust, and feelings of vulnerability when reflecting upon interaction with trauma care providers. There is a dearth of research that investigates the way that interactional phenomenon (bias, stereotyping, and uncertainty in race-discordant patient-clinician interactions) contributes to the development of these health disparities. Focused descriptive inquiry on the experience of minority trauma patients cared for in America's hospitals is needed to fill this gap. The purpose of this proposed research is to describe the experiences of Black urban trauma patients to understand how and why care practices and clinician-patient interactions might manifest in poorer outcomes among minority patients. A qualitative inquiry, using participant observation and embedded interview, inclusive of both patient and clinician perspectives, will be used to explore these interactional processes throughout the hospitalization experience - from emergency department to hospital discharge. Black trauma patients are selected as the population of interest because they comprise a disproportionately high percentage of minority patients presenting to hospitals for injury treatment. Citing this research in an urban trauma center is ideal because these institutions are often situated in areas of racial and ethnic diversity, designated as centers equipped to treat a large spectrum of injury type and severity, and typically have a higher census of injured patients than smaller non-urban medical centers. With an enhanced understanding of the experiences of Black patients in the urban trauma care system, we will be able to alter processes of care to improve outcomes and test health-promoting interventions designed to: reduce disparities in injury outcomes, prevent re-injury and build positive connections to other health services essential in facilitating an optimal recovery. This research will build the foundation for the applicant's the long term goal of developing a program of research to explore the social, economic and environmental determinants of inequities in injury risk and outcomes, in order to inform interventions aimed at building greater equity in access to and provision of care for the traumatically injured. The goals of this project are well aligned with NINR's priority to reduce an eliminate health disparities.    Despite comparable severity of injury and burden of comorbidities, minority patients experience poorer outcomes from traumatic injuries when compared to their White peers with the same injury, health characteristics, and insurance status. It is essential that the social aspects of trauma care that may contribute to poorer outcomes, including in-hospital processes, are better understood. With an enhanced understanding of the experiences of Black patients in the trauma care system, we will be better positioned to alter processes of care to improve outcomes and test appropriate health-promoting interventions designed to reduce health disparities.",Experiences of Black Trauma Patients: Why are there disparate racial outcomes?,8472358,F31NR013599,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Americas ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' Behavior ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Communication ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' Interview ', ' Judgment ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Societies ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' trauma centers ', ' United States ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Survivors ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Research Activity ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Inferior ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' recidivism ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' American College of Surgeons ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' health literacy ', ' injured ', ' care systems ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' burden of injury ', ' trauma care ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2013,42232,0.2153779977646442
"Racial Disparities in the Economic Outcomes of Work-Related Disabilities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been considerable public effort to identify, understand and eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in health and economic opportunities in the United States. A body of work has demonstrated the presence of wide disparities in population health across different subsets of the population, with racial and ethnic minorities subject to significantly higher morbidity and mortality from chronic disease on average. In addition to disparities in health, there is also widespread evidence documenting disparities in economic opportunity, with racial and ethnic minorities consistently earning lower pay for comparable work.  While there are well-established disparities in health and earnings in minority populations, it is less understood how different sections of the population are affected by accidents in the workplace. Work-related injuries and disabilities impose large costs on society, and often have significant and lasting impacts on labor market outcomes for injured workers. Past studies have considered how the frequency and severity of occupational injuries differs across different racial and ethnic groups, but with relatively few definitive conclusions. In particular, it is largely unknown how the economic outcomes of injuries differ according to race. Conceptually, this is a difficult question to answer. On the one hand, the fact that most minorities have fewer employment opportunities means that they are less likely to work and thus face less exposure to workplace injury risk. However, when they do work they tend to work in riskier jobs, increasing their potential risk. Moreover, the effect of injuries on economic outcomes is complicated by their baseline disparities in employment and health. More work is needed to understand racial differences in economic outcomes after a workplace injury.  Our study would address this issue and provide new evidence about racial and ethnic disparities in employment and earnings after a work-related disability. We will use data from a large, national survey with detailed information on employment, earnings, demographic characteristics and disability. We will use instrumental variables to estimate racial disparities in the frequency and severity of injuries independent of measurement error or selection bias. Finally, we will conduct statistical tests to identify how much of these disparities can be explained by observed characteristics and how much is unexplained and due to other factors such as discrimination.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This goal of this study is to provide new evidence about racial and ethnic disparities in employment and earnings after a work-related disability. We will use data from a large, national survey with detailed information on employment, earnings, demographic characteristics and disability, and use instrumental variable methods to estimate racial disparities in the frequency and severity of injuries independent of measurement error or selection bias.

"Farm Theater: A Novel Safety Strategy Approach for Agricultural Communities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excessive worker injury rates continue in agriculture. Adult and senior farmers in the Southern U.S. region experience the highest occurrence of agricultural occupational injury and mortality in the nation. In this community-based, translationa intervention effectiveness research study, we will work with established farm community organizations in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi, to develop and test a novel intervention: didactic reader's theater, with 450 adult and senior farmers, and their family members, to positively change farm work culture and safety behavior. A comparison group (n=450) will allow rigorous analysis of the effect of the intervention. In the final year we will pilot test the intervention's effect with younger farmers (n=80), plus a comparison group, (n=80). Together with the farm organizations, we will establish mechanisms to sustain the intervention in farm communities. We expect, given our pilot data, that this intervention will have a substantial impact on decreasing injury risk in the target states and other southern states, with generalizability to multiple rural areas in the United States.

"Prevention Program to Reduce Injury Disparities Among Latino Day Laborers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latino day laborers (LDL) experience a disproportionately high rate of on-the-job injuries and fatalities compared with other workers in the U.S. The typical LDL is male, foreign-born, living below the poverty level and Spanish monolingual. In Texas, where most construction workers are LDL, 89 construction workers died on the job in 2010 - a rate of one death every 4 days. Some studies suggest that their injury rate may in fact be 3 to 4 times higher. Safety programs recommended for LDL have had limited success increasing their safety at work, partly because they do not consider the pressing needs confronted by these workers. These programs may have missed a critical component of injury prevention by failing to address psychosocial stressors that emerge from harsh living conditions and economic inequalities which amplify LDL risk for injury at work. Until safety programs are created to help LDL negotiate the hazards they face at work in the context of the psychosocial factors that amplify their risk, it will not be possible to effectively reduce the unacceptably hig risk LDL face of being injured or dying on the job. We are joining forces with our community partners to form a Community Advisory Board (CAB) consisting of day labor leaders, university-based researchers, and community-based and employer organizations to address this question: How can LDL increase their ability to effectively cope with the psychosocial factors that put them at increased risk of unintended injury at work? This study has the following aims: (1) Identify intervention priorities using a corner-based needs assessment to document occupational and psychosocial risk and protective factors that increase LDL risk for injury. (2) With the CAB, jointly design a culturally responsive and context appropriate OSHA 10-based safety intervention that also addresses psychosocial risks to reduce LDL injuries. (3) Collaboratively pilot a corner-level intervention and conduct an evaluation to assess the safety program's feasibility and acceptability as determined by the extent to which we can recruit, retain and follow-up LDL over the course of the study.

"Psychological Effects of Injuries in Urban Black Men: A Disparate Health Issue DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application responds to PA-10-236: Health Promotion in Ethnic and Racial Minority Men with a focus on injury as a flashpoint from which interventions can be introduced to improve health and reduce disparity in urban black men. Although an acute event, injury is a known portal to significant long-term health problems.  The risk of sustaining a recurrent injury is as high as 40 percent, and being black itself is an independent risk factor for recidivism. The psychological effects of injury are substantial and often unrecognized: 20-56 percent develops depression and 20 percent develop post-traumatic stress (PTS) and they exacerbate the risk of injury recidivism. To improve the ability to recognize post-injury depression and PTS in black men, a comprehensive conceptual framework guides this investigation to understand the risk and protective factors that are borne by the intersection of class, race, and location. To this end, this study will innovatively assess lifetime accumulation of risk and protective factors at the personal and institutional levels, incorporate environmental data using geographic information systems, and will link these rich data to acute peri-traumatic subjective experiences.  Doing so will enable more accurate identification of black men who will develop post-injury depression or PTS, and thereby capitalize on injury as a point of intervention to mitigate negative health outcomes. Given that black men have high exposure to stressors, are more likely to be hospitalized for injury in urban settings, are more likely to have psychological consequences, but are less likely to have psychiatric disorders diagnosed than whites, steps must be taken to address this health disparity. Symptoms typically surface after discharge, making it imperative to develop an empirically based risk stratification system to focus limited resources on black men most likely to need follow-up care. In response, the goals of this study are to a) create a risk profile for the emergence of post-injury depression or persistence of PTS by having accurately measured the unique contributions of personal, institutional, environmental risk and protective factors, and peri-traumatic subjective experiences, and 2) complement those findings with participants' expressions of their personal experiences.  This will be accomplished by enrolling a cohort of 900 urban black men who are hospitalized for injury and followed for 3 months post-discharge to measure the primary outcomes: depression and PTS. The specific  aims of this mixed-methods study are to: 1) evaluate and refine a model elucidating the interplay among peri- traumatic subjective experiences, risk factors, and protective factors that best predicts depression and PTS in  black men after traumatic injury~ 2) evaluate the predictive ability of two established, short clinical screeners to  predict the future development of post-injury depression and PTS and examine whether predictive  performance could be improved by including the novel risk and protective factors this study will obtain~ and 3)  gain a richer understanding of black men's experiences, to elucidate strategies used that enhance or detract  from their emotional recovery and their attitudes towards seeking help for psychological symptoms after injury. Black men in urban areas are at high risk for injury and to develop depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms after injury. Although black men have high exposure to stressors, are more likely to be hospitalized  for injury in urban settings, and are more likely to have psychological consequences but less likely to have  psychiatric disorders diagnosed than whites, steps must be taken to address this health disparity. The purpose is to examine the contribution of personal, institutional, environmental risk and protective factors and peri- traumatic subjective experiences to the emergence of post-injury depression or persistence of post-traumatic stress.",Psychological Effects of Injuries in Urban Black Men: A Disparate Health Issue,8821313,R01NR013503,"['Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Complement 2 ', ' Crime ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Hospitals ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Names ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Productivity ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Self Medication ', ' statistics ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' trauma centers ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Glean ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Surface ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Recovery ', ' Inequality ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' care seeking ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' recidivism ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' land use ', ' geospatial information system ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' social stress ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Stratification ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' community based participatory research ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2014,4931,0.06572743406446623
"The Penn Violence and Injury Control Research Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose the Penn Violence and Injury Control Research Center (PVICRC) as a developmental ICRC whose focus is the reduction of violence and injuries among low-resourced populations through the highest caliber science, education, and outreach. The proposed Center will bring together university, community, and government partners around injury and violence intervention programs with the highest potential for impact. These high impact programs will typically have three cardinal features; they will: make structural changes (for example, to places), be scalable to cover large populations, and be sustainable over long periods of time. Injury prevention among low-resourced populations faces unique issues of poverty, poor community engagement, eroding physical and service infrastructures, growing health disparities, and structural stressors in the surrounding environment that have, heretofore, been under-studied by violence and injury prevention researchers. While not ignoring the importance of rural injuries, a primary focus of the proposed Center would be to build more effective and efficient approaches to reduce violence and injury in an urban context by focusing on the intersections of environment, biology and behavior. In doing so, this developmental ICRC will build the infrastructure and capacity for a sustained, comprehensive injury center that will use research, education and outreach to prevent injuries more broadly for vulnerable, low-resourced communities. The Center's current academic and clinical environment is rich in resources for injury science, education and outreach, but has historically lacked a centralized structure dedicated to the development and maintenance of high caliber injury research scientists, training, translation, and outreach. The goal of this developmental Center is to promote and perform the highest quality research, training and translation of scientific discoveries into practice and policy, in order to reduce injuries, violence and their impact nationwide, particularly among vulnerable urban populations. The proposed developmental Center is organized around two cores, the Administrative Core and the Training, Education and Outreach (TEO) Core, a Planning Board, and a Centerpiece Research Project, a 3-arm randomized community intervention trial of actual changes to vacant and abandoned spaces in Philadelphia to scientifically assess the impact of these changes on violence. Led by the Administrative Core, the TEO Core, a Planning Board, and a Centerpiece Research Project will collaborate to complete important research, training and translation activities while, at the same time, engaging the Penn community, as well as local and national stakeholders, in the planning, implementation, and advancement of a fully funded and sustainable comprehensive ICRC.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose the Penn Violence and Injury Control Research Center (PVICRC) as a developmental ICRC whose focus is the reduction of violence and injuries among low-resourced populations through the highest caliber science and education.

"The impact of pediatric trauma centers on the outcome of injured children in Ohio     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic injury is a significant threat to our nation's children, having a higher mortality rate than all other causes of death combined. The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma states that injured children have special needs that ""may be optimally provided [for] in the environment of a children's hospital with a demonstrated commitment to trauma care."" However, only a small proportion of acute care hospitals are characterized as trauma centers (TC), and even fewer are pediatric trauma centers (PTC). The large number of injured children, compared to the relative scarcity of PTCs, dictates that injured children will be cared for in a variety of hospital settings. Large TCs, including PTCs, are generally located in urban settings with a high population density. This creates a health disparity, leaving children in rural settings at a disadvantage and more vulnerable to poor outcomes from severe trauma. We cannot fully understand the magnitude and scope of pediatric trauma by state, region or nationally until we begin to analyze data collected from non-trauma centers as part of a statewide system. Because most injured children are treated in centers that lack trauma center designation and do not consistently, if at all, report trauma-related data, there is a significant gap in knowledge about this health disparity regarding the volume, treatments, and outcomes of injured children. The proposed project takes a critical step to address this current gap in research by analyzing data from the Ohio Trauma Registry, which captures data from approximately 87% of Ohio hospitals, as required by law, including 138 non-trauma centers (NTC). A total of 19,187 pediatric patients, over a 5-year period, will be analyzed to evaluate in-hospital mortality, length of stay, operations and complications by relevant covariates. Patients transferred from scene to an NTC, in the state of Ohio will be compared to those transferred directly from scene to a designated TC. This will provide valuable information about statewide pediatric injury rates, based on population density and where they are initially transported (via EMS or self- transport). Importantly, 58% of the traumatically injured pediatric patients in the Ohio trauma registry in the year 2010 were transferred from a hospital emergency department to another hospital. The outcomes of transferred patients may be confounded, as the patients may be more severely injured and have longer delays to appropriate specialized care. Therefore, we will analyze this group separately and include a calculated variable describing time since injury. Maps of injury burden, resources and access will be generated. We will estimate both distance traveled and time elapsed between injury and admission to the final point of care to characterize the relationship between rurality and treatment of pediatric trauma. At the end of the project, we expect to have a more thorough understanding of the magnitude of pediatric trauma and health disparities, especially in rural areas. Maps of injury burden, resources and access will be generated. The results of the analysis will reflect a statewide representation of where children are injured, where they first receive care and a characterization of patients who require inter-facility transport. This study wil provide a statewide perspective on the magnitude of the pediatric rural health disparity, and inform a future in-depth, prospective national study.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Traumatic injury is a significant threat to our nation's children, having a higher mortality rate than all other causes of death combined. Children in rural settings are at a disadvantage and more vulnerable to poor outcomes from severe trauma because they do not have access to trauma centers.

"Disparities in Disability after Traumatic Brain Injury for Hispanic Children     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability for children in the U.S. Disability after TBI is higher among children with no or government insurance, poor family functioning and lower levels of parental education. In a preliminary study, we documented disparities in long term disability after TBI for Hispanic children; Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) children experience significantly larger reductions in health related quality of life, participation in activities, and ability to communicate and care for themselves 3 years after injury. It is unclear if use of rehabilitation services and/or cultural and language barriers contributed to the documented differences. We propose a three-phase research plan to compare patterns and determinants of utilization of rehabilitation services and its association with disability outcomes between Hispanic, NHW and non-Hispanic Black (NHB) children. We will also develop and pilot-test the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally tailored intervention to reduce barriers for use of rehabilitation services by Hispanic children with TBI. The long term goal of this K23 award is for the candidate to develop as an independent researcher in the area of patient outcomes in vulnerable populations and pediatric trauma disparities research. The K23 candidate is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at the University of Washington. The candidate proposes a five-year training plan with the support of faculty mentors who have expertise in injury outcomes research, community based participatory research, qualitative methods, and intervention trials in minority communities. The University of Washington, Seattle Children's Hospital, and Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center provide excellent institutional support and resources for this award. The research involves three studies. Study 1 will compare use of inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services between Hispanic, NHB and NHW pediatric patients with TBI, and its association with disability. Study 2 will compare predisposing enabling and need factors for use of outpatient rehabilitation services between the three ethnic groups. Study 3 will develop and pilot-test a culturally tailored intervention to reduce barriers fr use of rehabilitation services by Hispanic children with TBI. These studies will expand our understanding of the potential reasons for disparities in the provision of care for children with TBI. It will clarify the role of Hispanic ethnicity in the receipt of rehabilitation care and highe risk of disability after TBI, independent of socioeconomic and minority status. It will lay the groundwork for a multicenter study to evaluate a culturally tailored intervention to reduce barriers for use of rehabilitation services by Hispanic families, which can also serve as a model for other vulnerable populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Significant disparities in long term disability after traumatic brain injury (TBI) exist for Hispanic children. Identifying patterns and determinants for use of rehabilitation services after TBI will reveal risk factors that can allow intervention strategies t be targeted more effectively to Hispanic Children and other vulnerable populations.

"Evaluating a Web-based Child Passenger Safety Program:  Safety in Seconds v 2.0    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is a revision of 1RO1HD069221. We are addressing the need for innovative research on prevention in the context of emergency medical services, specifically evaluation of behavior change interventions using computer technology. We propose to test a web based, theory driven, computer-tailored intervention for child passenger safety in two Pediatric Emergency Departments (PEDs) and a Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Service (PTS) that serve diverse populations. The focus of this proposal is on parents' use of child restraint devices (CRDs) -- Car Safety Seats (CSS) and Belt-Positioning Booster Seats (BPBS) -- for their children ages 8 years and younger. These safety behaviors were chosen because they are effective countermeasures known to help prevent motor vehicle occupant injuries, the leading cause of child mortality in the United States. Although CSS use with younger children is common, there are disparities across populations, BPBS use for older children is low, and misuse of CRDs is widespread.  Our previous work, including the NICHD-funded study of Safety in Seconds (SIS) and that of others, has demonstrated that computer-tailored interventions can be feasible and effective in clinical settings, including PEDs. However, our work is the only research to our knowledge applying this technology to the specific issues of CSS and BPBS and the first to use it with Spanish speaking families. The original SIS was a kiosk-based, computer tailored program that demonstrated some success in a low income, urban, and predominantly African-American population in a single PED. This proposal will test an enhanced web-based program, Safety in Seconds v 2.0 (SIS v2.0), with English and Spanish speaking families from Baltimore, MD and Little Rock, AR. We will also extend our prior work by adding several elements never previously considered: testing the program in a PTS; testing a Spanish language version; and adding text messaging reminders and a web portal that can be accessed multiple times to reinforce the educational messages. Evaluating the program's cost benefit and determining barriers and facilitators to program adoption and implementation are also innovative aspects of the proposed work that will contribute to future dissemination.  The specific aims of the study are to: 1) evaluate the impact of a web-based, tailored program on English and Spanish speaking parents' child passenger safety knowledge, prevention beliefs, and the proper and consistent use of CSS and BPBS for their children ages 0-8; 2) evaluate the cost benefit ratio of the program for parents' utilization of BPBS for their children; and 3) determine the barriers and facilitators to program adoption and implementation in both PED and PTS settings. This 5-year study will take place in the Johns Hopkins PED (JH-PED) and the Johns Hopkins PTS (JH-PTS) as well as in the Arkansas Children's Hospital PED (AR-PED). Methods include: a) a modification of the existing Safety in Seconds program to convert it to a web-based platform and incorporate additional video, audio, texting reminders and repeat visit capabilities; b) a randomized controlled trial with 1,650 parents (600 JH-PED, 450 JH-PTS, 600 AR-PED), including baseline and 6-month follow up assessments and CSS observations; c) a cost benefit analysis of the program's expected financial benefit from the perspective of a third party payer of medical claims; and d) an in-depth examination of program adoption and implementation in all three study settings using qualitative data collected from key informant interviews, direct observations of the clinic environments, and document review.  With the ever-growing access to computers, results of this work will have widespread utility for disseminating effective CSS and BPBS behavior change programs to a broad audience, and we will advance the application of computer tailoring theories and methods in a new area.        This proposal will evaluate an innovative web-based program -- Safety in Seconds v 2.0 - to increase the proper and consistent use of Car Safety Seats and Belt-Positioning Booster Seats for children ages 8 years and younger. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for children and child restraint devices are proven to reduce the risk of death and injury. The program will be evaluated in pediatric emergency departments and a pediatric trauma center with both English and Spanish speaking families. We will also complete a cost benefit analysis of the program and a study of how to implement the program in other settings.

"Expressive Writing Intervention for PTSD Prevention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R34 pilot intervention application seeks funds to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of a novel intervention aimed at preventing the development of posttraumatic stress disorder in adult survivors of serious physical injury. The intervention, which involves written self-disclosure, is derived from basic social psychological laboratory research, and will be translated for use as an applied tool in the context of post- trauma hospitalization aftercare. The planned evaluation will recruit patients drawn from a large trauma center that provides services to a predominantly Hispanic and low SES community. The scientific literature suggests that this community may have particular need for novel interventions directed at preventing the development of trauma-related psychopathology. Study participants (N = 106) at risk for developing PTSD would be recruited during hospitalization for treatment of physical injury, and randomly assigned to participate in one of two writing conditions: written emotional disclosure (N = 53) or a control condition in which participants write about mundane topics (N = 53).  The overarching objective of the planned research is to collect information needed to determine the feasibility and potential merit of mounting a full-scale study of writing interventions as strategies to prevent the development of PTSD in physical trauma survivors.  The specific aims of this study are: (1) to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, acceptability, and safety of the writing interventions; (2) to provide a preliminary evaluation as to whether the writing intervention possesses promise as  strategy for preventing the development of PTSD in physical trauma survivors; (3) to assess the importance of age, education, reading level, and acculturation as possible moderators  of the impact of the intervention on mental health outcomes; and (4) to examine possible mechanisms by which the writing interventions may exert their impact on mental  health outcomes.  If the results of this pilot study and the subsequent full-scale intervention prove successful, then trauma center service providers would have a versatile, low cost, and easily accessible tool to offer to physical injury survivors at risk for trauma-related psychopathology. This tool may be particularly useful for economically- disadvantaged Hispanic survivors who may choose not to avail themselves of formal mental health services. Knowledge derived from this randomized controlled trial regarding possible moderators and mediators of treatment efficacy can contribute to the development of more efficacious interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of a self-administrable and short writing intervention aimed at preventing the development of posttraumatic stress disorder in adult survivors of serious physical injury. Survivors of serious injury are at risk for PTSD in the weeks and months following injury, yet few seek mental health services. The writing interventions are not intended to replace proven approaches to treating or preventing mental health problems but their low cost and easy accessibility may address documented barriers to receiving more formal mental health services.

"The UCLA South African Trauma Research Training Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The UCLA/South African Trauma Training Research (Phodiso) Program seeks five additional years of funding to prepare future investigators to conduct research on trauma exposure and injury prevention in the context of South Africa's high levels of interpersonal and community violence and intentional injuries. The Phodiso Program is an international collaboration between UCLA and the South African Research Consortium (SARC), which includes the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC), North-West University (NWU), and University of Cape Town (UCT) and is based on three NIH-funded projects: 1) The Eban Project, a randomized clinical trial testing a culturally congruent intervention for HIV serodiscordant African American couples (R01; 2001-2011); 2) The Aftermath of Rape Among South African Women (The Fulufhelo Project), a study examining the short and long-term psychosocial sequelae of rape among South African women (R03; 2009-2012); and 3) The HIV/AIDS Translational Training Program (HATT) for racial and ethnic minority postdoctoral Scholars and early career investigators interested in studying HIV/AIDS, mental health and substance abuse and associated co-morbid disparities (R25; 2009-2011). Guided by ecological and social learning theories, the focus of the Phodiso Scholar's research will be to minimize the negative health and mental health effects of trauma exposure, specifically depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in South Africa. Developed over the past five years, our multidisciplinary training program proposes to expand to investigate and train on biologic and genetic markers and mediators of stress and thus, to be a more comprehensive biobehavioral trauma training program. During the initial funding period, eight scholars were trained and will now compose the Technical Advisory Group (TAG). For this renewal, the UCLA and SARC core faculty and TAG will conduct a countrywide application process to select one early career research candidates per year for a two-year postdoctoral fellowship. Scholars will receive research mentorship including a quarter of study (i.e., a 3-month period) at UCLA, one selection and planning meeting and one short-term trauma workshop each year in South Africa. Scholars will conduct their own research projects in South Africa as a basis for future studies in this field, as well as work closely with their SARC host university and TAG mentors. The Phodiso Trauma Training program and the research careers of the scholars will be tracked over time. Specifically, the sustainability of the training program and integration into academic, private, and government-supported agencies and the Scholar's ability to establish and sustain independent research careers will be evaluated and documented. Future goals will include encouraging the South African government to support, endorse and adopt the Phodiso program as a successful and replicable model of cross-cultural trauma research training.

"Experiences of Black Trauma Patients: Why are there disparate racial outcomes?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite comparable severity of injury and burden of comorbidities, minority patients experience poorer outcomes from traumatic injuries when compared to their White peers with the same injury, health characteristics, and insurance status. There is evidence of inequities both in injury mortality and in the experiences of survivors. Patients belonging to racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to die after traumatic injury in America's hospitals. Those that survive are less likely to be discharged to comprehensive rehabilitation facilities and describe uncertainty, distrust, and feelings of vulnerability when reflecting upon interaction with trauma care providers. There is a dearth of research that investigates the way that interactional phenomenon (bias, stereotyping, and uncertainty in race-discordant patient-clinician interactions) contributes to the development of these health disparities. Focused descriptive inquiry on the experience of minority trauma patients cared for in America's hospitals is needed to fill this gap. The purpose of this proposed research is to describe the experiences of Black urban trauma patients to understand how and why care practices and clinician-patient interactions might manifest in poorer outcomes among minority patients. A qualitative inquiry, using participant observation and embedded interview, inclusive of both patient and clinician perspectives, will be used to explore these interactional processes throughout the hospitalization experience - from emergency department to hospital discharge. Black trauma patients are selected as the population of interest because they comprise a disproportionately high percentage of minority patients presenting to hospitals for injury treatment. Citing this research in an urban trauma center is ideal because these institutions are often situated in areas of racial and ethnic diversity, designated as centers equipped to treat a large spectrum of injury type and severity, and typically have a higher census of injured patients than smaller non-urban medical centers. With an enhanced understanding of the experiences of Black patients in the urban trauma care system, we will be able to alter processes of care to improve outcomes and test health-promoting interventions designed to: reduce disparities in injury outcomes, prevent re-injury and build positive connections to other health services essential in facilitating an optimal recovery. This research will build the foundation for the applicant's the long term goal of developing a program of research to explore the social, economic and environmental determinants of inequities in injury risk and outcomes, in order to inform interventions aimed at building greater equity in access to and provision of care for the traumatically injured. The goals of this project are well aligned with NINR's priority to reduce an eliminate health disparities.    Despite comparable severity of injury and burden of comorbidities, minority patients experience poorer outcomes from traumatic injuries when compared to their White peers with the same injury, health characteristics, and insurance status. It is essential that the social aspects of trauma care that may contribute to poorer outcomes, including in-hospital processes, are better understood. With an enhanced understanding of the experiences of Black patients in the trauma care system, we will be better positioned to alter processes of care to improve outcomes and test appropriate health-promoting interventions designed to reduce health disparities.",Experiences of Black Trauma Patients: Why are there disparate racial outcomes?,8661583,F31NR013599,"['Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Americas ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' Behavior ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Censuses ', ' Communication ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' Interview ', ' Judgment ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Societies ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Testing ', ' trauma centers ', ' United States ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Survivors ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Research Activity ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Inferior ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' recidivism ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' American College of Surgeons ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' health literacy ', ' injured ', ' care systems ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' blind ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' burden of injury ', ' trauma care ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2014,42676,0.2153779977646442
"Chemokine-related acute lung injury pathogenesis in African-American patients DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Kirsten Kangelaris, a hospitalist at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Kangelaris is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented clinical research in acute lung injury (ALI), with a focus on understanding biologic and genetic factors that impact susceptibility to and prognosis in acute lung injury among African-American patients. This K23 award will provide Dr. Kangelaris with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert patient-oriented clinical and translational researcher in acute lung injury; (2) to elucidate genetic and biologic mechanisms of acute lung injury combining innovative approaches including genetics, protein markers and functional genomics; (3) to implement advanced biostatistical techniques in clinical studies, including advanced regression and bioinformatics; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Kangelaris has assembled a multidisciplinary team comprised of a primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, who has extensive experience in translational, pathogenesis-oriented ALI research, and in mentoring junior faculty to independent investigators, and two co-mentors: Dr. Elad Ziv, an expert in genetic mapping in admixed populations, and Dr. Bradley Aouizerat, a leader in genomics and molecular epidemiology. Additionally, Dr. Kangelaris will benefit from the expertise of several scientific advisors. Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common cause of acute respiratory failure in hospitalized patients, and African Americans suffer the highest ALI incidence and mortality rates. Dr. Kangelaris' research plan builds on her preliminary data to examine chemokine-dependent pathways of ALI pathogenesis in African-American patients. She will study the role of a functional polymorphism in the Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines gene (Darc -46C/C, rs2814778), prevalent in individuals of African descent, that has been associated with worse ALI outcomes in her preliminary work, possibly via an increase in circulating interleukin (IL)-8. Dr. Kangelaris will test the extent to which this so-called ""Dufy null"" genotype is associated with susceptibility to acute lung injury (Aim 1), determine whether the Duffy null genotype is associated with differences in Duffy- binding chemokine levels (e.g., IL-8) and biomarkers of injury among patients with acute lung injury (Aim 2), and to use whole blood gene expression to identify chemokine-related pathways of acute lung injury pathogenesis in African-American patients (Aim 3). This research plan makes use of the existing infrastructure of Dr. Carolyn Calfee's Early Assessment of Renal and Lung Injury (EARLI) cohort at UCSF and Dr. Lorraine Ware's Validation of biomarkers in Acute Lung Injury Diagnosis (VALID) cohort at Vanderbilt University. This research will form the basis for an R01-level application to study the association between chemokine-related genomic and protein markers and acute lung injury susceptibility and outcomes in African-American patients. Public Health Relevance Identification of genetic and biologic factors that contribute to acute lung injury pathogenesis among African American patients is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to personalized risk assessment, improved early management and targeted treatments for these patients. Additionally, identification of novel mechanisms of disease in a high risk population will expand our basic understanding of the pathogenesis of acute lung injury relevant in other

"Farm Theater: A Novel Safety Strategy Approach for Agricultural Communities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excessive worker injury rates continue in agriculture. Adult and senior farmers in the Southern U.S. region experience the highest occurrence of agricultural occupational injury and mortality in the nation. In this community-based, translationa intervention effectiveness research study, we will work with established farm community organizations in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi, to develop and test a novel intervention: didactic reader's theater, with 450 adult and senior farmers, and their family members, to positively change farm work culture and safety behavior. A comparison group (n=450) will allow rigorous analysis of the effect of the intervention. In the final year we will pilot test the intervention's effect with younger farmers (n=80), plus a comparison group, (n=80). Together with the farm organizations, we will establish mechanisms to sustain the intervention in farm communities. We expect, given our pilot data, that this intervention will have a substantial impact on decreasing injury risk in the target states and other southern states, with generalizability to multiple rural areas in the United States. This proposal addresses HP 2020 Occupational Safety and Health through the NORA Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing (AgFF) Sector Council's Strategic Goal #2 - Vulnerable workers (subset older farmers), Action step 2.43: ""Facilitate the development and evaluation of high quality and appropriate materials where gaps exist""; Goal #3: ""Move proven health and safety strategies into agricultural, forestry and fishing workplaces through the development of partnerships and collaborative efforts""; Goal #4: ""Reduce the number, rate, and severity of traumatic injuries and deaths involving hazards of production agriculture and support activities"", and Goal #5: ""Improve the health and well-being of agricultural workers by reducing occupational causes or contributing factors to acute and chronic illness and disease"". It also addresses the cross sectors of work organization, health disparities, traumatic injury, and stress-related disorders. The specific aims are to: 1. Develop and deliver, in cooperation with the farm community, a translational intervention, didactic readers  theater, to reduce injury and enhance the health of adult and senior farmers, and their families; 2. Test the efficacy of the agricultural health/safety didactic readers theater in changig farm work behavior of  adult and senior farmers and their families; 3. Strengthen the local capacity of agricultural communities and organizations to develop and deliver effective  health and safety interventions through theater and other approaches, over time (sustainability). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Agriculture has excessive worker injury rates. Senior farmers and adult farmers in the South experience some of the highest occupational injury and mortality in the nation. In this community-based intervention project, we will work with established farm community organizations to develop and test a didactic reader's theater intervention to positively change farm work culture and safety behavior.

"Psychological Effects of Injuries in Urban Black Men: A Disparate Health Issue     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application responds to PA-10-236: Health Promotion in Ethnic and Racial Minority Men with a focus on injury as a flashpoint from which interventions can be introduced to improve health and reduce disparity in urban black men. Although an acute event, injury is a known portal to significant long-term health problems.  The risk of sustaining a recurrent injury is as high as 40 percent, and being black itself is an independent risk factor for recidivism. The psychological effects of injury are substantial and often unrecognized: 20-56 percent develops depression and 20 percent develop post-traumatic stress (PTS) and they exacerbate the risk of injury recidivism. To improve the ability to recognize post-injury depression and PTS in black men, a comprehensive conceptual framework guides this investigation to understand the risk and protective factors that are borne by the intersection of class, race, and location. To this end, this study will innovatively assess lifetime accumulation of risk and protective factors at the personal and institutional levels, incorporate environmental data using geographic information systems, and will link these rich data to acute peri-traumatic subjective experiences.  Doing so will enable more accurate identification of black men who will develop post-injury depression or PTS, and thereby capitalize on injury as a point of intervention to mitigate negative health outcomes. Given that black men have high exposure to stressors, are more likely to be hospitalized for injury in urban settings, are more likely to have psychological consequences, but are less likely to have psychiatric disorders diagnosed than whites, steps must be taken to address this health disparity. Symptoms typically surface after discharge, making it imperative to develop an empirically based risk stratification system to focus limited resources on black men most likely to need follow-up care. In response, the goals of this study are to a) create a risk profile for the emergence of post-injury depression or persistence of PTS by having accurately measured the unique contributions of personal, institutional, environmental risk and protective factors, and peri-traumatic subjective experiences, and 2) complement those findings with participants' expressions of their personal experiences.  This will be accomplished by enrolling a cohort of 900 urban black men who are hospitalized for injury and followed for 3 months post-discharge to measure the primary outcomes: depression and PTS. The specific  aims of this mixed-methods study are to: 1) evaluate and refine a model elucidating the interplay among peri- traumatic subjective experiences, risk factors, and protective factors that best predicts depression and PTS in  black men after traumatic injury~ 2) evaluate the predictive ability of two established, short clinical screeners to  predict the future development of post-injury depression and PTS and examine whether predictive  performance could be improved by including the novel risk and protective factors this study will obtain~ and 3)  gain a richer understanding of black men's experiences, to elucidate strategies used that enhance or detract  from their emotional recovery and their attitudes towards seeking help for psychological symptoms after injury.                              Black men in urban areas are at high risk for injury and to develop depression and posttraumatic stress symptoms after injury. Although black men have high exposure to stressors, are more likely to be hospitalized  for injury in urban settings, and are more likely to have psychological consequences but less likely to have  psychiatric disorders diagnosed than whites, steps must be taken to address this health disparity. The purpose is to examine the contribution of personal, institutional, environmental risk and protective factors and peri- traumatic subjective experiences to the emergence of post-injury depression or persistence of post-traumatic stress.

"Challenging Treatment Paradigms for Achilles Tendon Ruptures in an Animal Model ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Achilles tendon ruptures result in significant pain, disability, and healthcare costs. Although both men and women show no difference in mean age or activity in sport at the time of rupture, gender disparity is prevalent with 75% and 25% of ruptures occurring in men and women, respectively. Differences in hormone physiology between sexes may be a factor influencing tendon health. These gender specific mechanisms may be protective of injury in women and could encourage more targeted rehabilitation. Unfortunately, current rehabilitation and treatment protocols are not gender specific. This is of particular importance since the current standard of care for male and female injuries rests on the assumption that Achilles tendons for otherwise healthy individuals should be treated synonymously. The overall goal of this competitive revision is to define the tissue-level properties of healing Achilles tendon, in a dose-dependent estrogen response. This will be completed in a set of clinically-relevant treatment paradigms to establish the mechanical mechanisms of successful, and potentially differential, tissue repair response between sexes. We propose that the healing tendon environment is governed by specific structural and biologic properties that are influenced by hormonal mechanisms. These hormonal mechanisms may optimize tendon loading to promote improved fatigue mechanical parameters, which in turn, govern successful rehabilitation progression. In addition, hormone levels may reduce the maximum stress generation of muscles and therefore the risk of tendon elongation, which has been correlated with poor clinical outcomes. We will determine Achilles tendon properties in both genders, as well as functional performance and passive joint mechanics following tendon injury in an animal model. Importantly, muscle will be evaluated as well. An animal model will be used to control the injury and treatment strategies, analyze tissue properties, and, through methods developed for the parent grant, determine clinically relevant measures that define tissue healing. Our overall hypothesis is that Achilles tendons from females are capable of accelerated rehabilitation and quicker return to activity due to decreased gastrocnemius and soleus muscle strength potential. The following specific aims are designed to directly challenge the absence of gender specific rehabilitation programs for Achilles tendon injuries. Aim 1: To determine whether uninjured control Achilles tendons and muscle in OVX, female, or male rats have superior mechanical, structural and biological properties. Aim 2: To determine whether repaired Achilles tendons and musculature in male, female, or OVX rats have superior mechanical, structural, and histological properties in a set of clinically relevant conditions. Thi study has high impact by increasing sex differences research in understanding the mechanisms of Achilles tendon injury risk and healing. This approach to study tissue level properties post-surgery as a function of estrogen levels may indicate that women could have accelerated rehabilitation protocols. Such findings could reduce high healthcare burdens due to excessive lost work days.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although both men and women show no difference in mean age or activity in sport at the time of Achilles tendon rupture, gender disparity is prevalent with 75% and 25% of ruptures occurring in men and women, respectively.

"Evaluating a Web-based Child Passenger Safety Program:  Safety in Seconds v 2.0 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is a revision of 1RO1HD069221. We are addressing the need for innovative research on prevention in the context of emergency medical services, specifically evaluation of behavior change interventions using computer technology. We propose to test a web based, theory driven, computer-tailored intervention for child passenger safety in two Pediatric Emergency Departments (PEDs) and a Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Service (PTS) that serve diverse populations. The focus of this proposal is on parents' use of child restraint devices (CRDs) -- Car Safety Seats (CSS) and Belt-Positioning Booster Seats (BPBS) -- for their children ages 8 years and younger. These safety behaviors were chosen because they are effective countermeasures known to help prevent motor vehicle occupant injuries, the leading cause of child mortality in the United States. Although CSS use with younger children is common, there are disparities across populations, BPBS use for older children is low, and misuse of CRDs is widespread.  Our previous work, including the NICHD-funded study of Safety in Seconds (SIS) and that of others, has demonstrated that computer-tailored interventions can be feasible and effective in clinical settings, including PEDs. However, our work is the only research to our knowledge applying this technology to the specific issues of CSS and BPBS and the first to use it with Spanish speaking families. The original SIS was a kiosk-based, computer tailored program that demonstrated some success in a low income, urban, and predominantly African-American population in a single PED. This proposal will test an enhanced web-based program, Safety in Seconds v 2.0 (SIS v2.0), with English and Spanish speaking families from Baltimore, MD and Little Rock, AR. We will also extend our prior work by adding several elements never previously considered: testing the program in a PTS; testing a Spanish language version; and adding text messaging reminders and a web portal that can be accessed multiple times to reinforce the educational messages. Evaluating the program's cost benefit and determining barriers and facilitators to program adoption and implementation are also innovative aspects of the proposed work that will contribute to future dissemination.  The specific aims of the study are to: 1) evaluate the impact of a web-based, tailored program on English and Spanish speaking parents' child passenger safety knowledge, prevention beliefs, and the proper and consistent use of CSS and BPBS for their children ages 0-8; 2) evaluate the cost benefit ratio of the program for parents' utilization of BPBS for their children; and 3) determine the barriers and facilitators to program adoption and implementation in both PED and PTS settings. This 5-year study will take place in the Johns Hopkins PED (JH-PED) and the Johns Hopkins PTS (JH-PTS) as well as in the Arkansas Children's Hospital PED (AR-PED). Methods include: a) a modification of the existing Safety in Seconds program to convert it to a web-based platform and incorporate additional video, audio, texting reminders and repeat visit capabilities; b) a randomized controlled trial with 1,650 parents (600 JH-PED, 450 JH-PTS, 600 AR-PED), including baseline and 6-month follow up assessments and CSS observations; c) a cost benefit analysis of the program's expected financial benefit from the perspective of a third party payer of medical claims; and d) an in-depth examination of program adoption and implementation in all three study settings using qualitative data collected from key informant interviews, direct observations of the clinic environments, and document review.  With the ever-growing access to computers, results of this work will have widespread utility for disseminating effective CSS and BPBS behavior change programs to a broad audience, and we will advance the application of computer tailoring theories and methods in a new area. This proposal will evaluate an innovative web-based program -- Safety in Seconds v 2.0 - to increase the proper and consistent use of Car Safety Seats and Belt-Positioning Booster Seats for children ages 8 years and younger. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for children and child restraint devices are proven to reduce the risk of death and injury. The program will be evaluated in pediatric emergency departments and a pediatric trauma center with both English and Spanish speaking families.

"The UCLA South African Trauma Research Training Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The UCLA/South African Trauma Training Research (Phodiso) Program seeks five additional years of funding to prepare future investigators to conduct research on trauma exposure and injury prevention in the context of South Africa's high levels of interpersonal and community violence and intentional injuries. The Phodiso Program is an international collaboration between UCLA and the South African Research Consortium (SARC), which includes the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC), North-West University (NWU), and University of Cape Town (UCT) and is based on three NIH-funded projects: 1) The Eban Project, a randomized clinical trial testing a culturally congruent intervention for HIV serodiscordant African American couples (R01; 2001-2011); 2) The Aftermath of Rape Among South African Women (The Fulufhelo Project), a study examining the short and long-term psychosocial sequelae of rape among South African women (R03; 2009-2012); and 3) The HIV/AIDS Translational Training Program (HATT) for racial and ethnic minority postdoctoral Scholars and early career investigators interested in studying HIV/AIDS, mental health and substance abuse and associated co-morbid disparities (R25; 2009-2011). Guided by ecological and social learning theories, the focus of the Phodiso Scholar's research will be to minimize the negative health and mental health effects of trauma exposure, specifically depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in South Africa. Developed over the past five years, our multidisciplinary training program proposes to expand to investigate and train on biologic and genetic markers and mediators of stress and thus, to be a more comprehensive biobehavioral trauma training program. During the initial funding period, eight scholars were trained and will now compose the Technical Advisory Group (TAG). For this renewal, the UCLA and SARC core faculty and TAG will conduct a countrywide application process to select one early career research candidates per year for a two-year postdoctoral fellowship. Scholars will receive research mentorship including a quarter of study (i.e., a 3-month period) at UCLA, one selection and planning meeting and one short-term trauma workshop each year in South Africa. Scholars will conduct their own research projects in South Africa as a basis for future studies in this field, as well as work closely with their SARC host university and TAG mentors. The Phodiso Trauma Training program and the research careers of the scholars will be tracked over time. Specifically, the sustainability of the training program and integration into academic, private, and government-supported agencies and the Scholar's ability to establish and sustain independent research careers will be evaluated and documented. Future goals will include encouraging the South African government to support, endorse and adopt the Phodiso program as a successful and replicable model of cross-cultural trauma research training.

"Functional Characterization of ALI-Associated MYLK SNPs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute lung injury (ALI) is a disorder affecting over 200,000 U.S. patients per year and has an unacceptably high mortality of 30-35%. The pathophysiology of ALI centers on inflammation-induced disruption of the endothelial cell (EC) barrier lining the pulmonary vasculature, causing leakage of fluid, protein, and cells into the airspaces. Pulmonary endothelial barrier maintenance and recovery from injury is dependent on EC cytoskeletal dynamics. Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) is a multi-functional cytoskeletal effector protein that is a key regulator of barrier function and has been a focus of the Garcia lab for over 20 years. This work has clearly established that barrier-disrupting edemagenic agonists produce spatially localized MLC phosphorylation within cytoplasmic contractile stress fibers, resulting in actomyosin contraction, tension, and formation of paracellular gaps. In contrast, barrier-protective agonists induce nmMLCK translocation to cortical actin networks and into lamellipodial membrane protrusions designed to close paracellular gaps and restore barrier integrity. Additionally, nmMLCK regulates lung trafficking of inflammatory cells and is robustly activated by biophysical forces such as excessive mechanical stress, which underlies its implications in ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). Furthermore, levels of nmMLCK expression and enzymatic activity contribute to risk and severity of ALI and VILI in preclinical models and human samples. Previously, the Garcia lab has identified a haplotype of three coding SNPs (Pro21His, Ser147Pro, Val261Ala, ""3XSNP"") in the nmMLCK gene (MYLK) that is highly associated with increased ALI susceptibility and severe asthma.  This three SNP haplotype is significantly more common in individuals of African descent (AD) and likely contributes to the significant health disparities in ALI incidence and mortality. We hypothesize that these ALI-associated MYLK SNPs alter the structure of nmMLCK and that these structural changes impair lamellipodial activity and paracellular gap closure in response to inflammatory injury. We plan to perform functional studies of known MYLK SNPs using sophisticated biophysical and ultrastructural techniques including trans-endothelial resistance (TER) measurement, confocal microscopy and co-localization, kymography and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Subsequently, we plan to validate the clinical relevance of these SNPs in established preclinical models of ALI and VILI and clarify nmMLCK antagonism as a novel ALI therapeutic strategy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute lung injury (ALI), a complex disorder with an unacceptably high mortality rate of 35%, is characterized by inflammation-induced disruption of the endothelial cell barrier that lines the pulmonary vasculature, resulting in leakage of fluid, protein, and cells into the airspaces of the lung. Myosin light chain kinase is a cytoskeletal regulatory protein that is critically involved in endothelial barrier regulation. The proposed research aims to functionally characterize ALI-associated polymorphisms (SNPs) in the myosin light chain kinase gene (MYLK) at the cellular level and validate these findings in established preclinical models of ALI and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).            ",Functional Characterization of ALI-Associated MYLK SNPs,8968757,F30HL121982,"['Actins ', ' Actomyosin ', ' Affect ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Cells ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Endothelium ', ' Spillage ', ' Leakage ', ' Extravasation ', ' Genes ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kymography ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase ', ' Myosin light chain kinase 2, skeletal/cardiac muscle ', ' Myosin Regulatory Light-Chain Kinase ', ' Myosin Light Polypeptide Kinase ', ' Myosin Light Chain Kinase, Smooth Muscle and Non-Muscle Isozymes ', ' Myosin LCK ', ' Myosin Kinase ', ' MYLK2 ', ' EC 2.7.1.117 ', ' Myosin Light Chain Kinase ', ' Patients ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' gene product ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stress ', ' Mechanical Stress ', ' Work ', ' Ventilator ', ' Injury ', ' Acute ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' African ', ' Measurement ', ' Acute Pulmonary Injury ', ' Lung Injury, Acute ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Agonist ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Equus asinus ', ' Donkey ', ' Asses ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' restoration ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' FRET ', ' Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer ', ' trafficking ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' regulatory gene product ', ' Regulatory Protein ', ' genetic regulatory protein ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Focal Contacts ', ' Cell-Matrix Adherens Junctions ', ' Adhesion Plaques ', ' Focal Adhesions ', ' Stress Fibers ', ' prolylserine ', ' Pro-Ser ', ' prolyl-serine ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Vegf ', ' VEGFs ', ' Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' in vivo ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Ventilator-induced lung injury ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,F30,2015,48120,0.0294428189465011
"Disparities in Disability after Traumatic Brain Injury for Hispanic Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability for children in the U.S. Disability after TBI is higher among children with no or government insurance, poor family functioning and lower levels of parental education. In a preliminary study, we documented disparities in long term disability after TBI for Hispanic children; Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) children experience significantly larger reductions in health related quality of life, participation in activities, and ability to communicate and care for themselves 3 years after injury. It is unclear if use of rehabilitation services and/or cultural and language barriers contributed to the documented differences. We propose a three-phase research plan to compare patterns and determinants of utilization of rehabilitation services and its association with disability outcomes between Hispanic, NHW and non-Hispanic Black (NHB) children. We will also develop and pilot-test the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally tailored intervention to reduce barriers for use of rehabilitation services by Hispanic children with TBI. The long term goal of this K23 award is for the candidate to develop as an independent researcher in the area of patient outcomes in vulnerable populations and pediatric trauma disparities research. The K23 candidate is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at the University of Washington. The candidate proposes a five-year training plan with the support of faculty mentors who have expertise in injury outcomes research, community based participatory research, qualitative methods, and intervention trials in minority communities. The University of Washington, Seattle Children's Hospital, and Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center provide excellent institutional support and resources for this award. The research involves three studies. Study 1 will compare use of inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services between Hispanic, NHB and NHW pediatric patients with TBI, and its association with disability. Study 2 will compare predisposing enabling and need factors for use of outpatient rehabilitation services between the three ethnic groups. Study 3 will develop and pilot-test a culturally tailored intervention to reduce barriers fr use of rehabilitation services by Hispanic children with TBI. These studies will expand our understanding of the potential reasons for disparities in the provision of care for children with TBI. It will clarify the role of Hispanic ethnicity in the receipt of rehabilitation care and highe risk of disability after TBI, independent of socioeconomic and minority status. It will lay the groundwork for a multicenter study to evaluate a culturally tailored intervention to reduce barriers for use of rehabilitation services by Hispanic families, which can also serve as a model for other vulnerable populations.

"Investigating Failures of Notification and Monitoring in Outpatient Care: the Safety Promotion Action Research and Knowledge (SPARK) Network ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ensuring patient safety remains a critical issue for health care systems. In particular, ambulatory (outpatient) health care settings are vulnerable to patient safety concerns. The majority of health care is delivered in ambulatory settings, with 1.2 billion outpatient visits annually in the United States (U.S.). Between failures of monitoring, and missed and delayed diagnosis, there is significant morbidity and mortality from patient safety problems in outpatient care. Although strides have been made in recognizing and preventing adverse events, little is known about the epidemiology of patient safety in ambulatory care settings and factors that contribute to these disparities. The overall goals of this proposal are t examine the epidemiology of patient safety in ambulatory care settings that care for diverse, low-income populations as follows; (1) to characterize the incidence and prevalence of specific safety gaps, by race/ ethnicity and language proficiency; (2) to gather in- depth, qualitative evidence about strategies that can improve safety and characterize disparities in patient safety; (3) to pilot-test patient safety monitoring methodologies in a diverse sample of five safety net health care systems; and (4) to develop a measurement and error investigation toolkit for dissemination amongst safety-net health care systems. Specifically, we will identify the extent of missed notification for actionable test results and extent of missed monitoring for high-risk populations. These two process gaps, periodic monitoring of high-risk conditions and notification of actionable abnormal test results, both lead to preventable patient harm. While these care gaps are documented, the extent of disparities in harm and the populations at highest risk remain unclear. To further deepen this knowledge, we will elucidate underlying causes for these safety gaps, focusing on disparities we identify in the data. Finally, we aim to give safety-net health systems participating in this study the methodological tools to conduct measurement of these safety gaps and perform event investigation, in order to set the stage for future improvement and innovation work to close gaps in disparities. We propose a collaborative Safety Promotion Action Research and Knowledge Network (SPARK Network) to achieve the following specific aims: 1) to develop feasible, timely, and accurate electronic measures of patient safety notification and monitoring gaps in an ambulatory care setting for high-risk sub- populations and characterize the extent of disparities in patient safety; 2) to conduct a root cause analysis of patient safety notification/ monitoring gaps in five public ambulatory care settings to identify factors contributing to these disparities; and 3) to evaluate the pilot implementation of patient safety monitoring methodologies developed from Aims 1 and 2 across five diverse ambulatory health care settings. We envision that pilot findings from this project wil result in a measurement and root cause analysis toolkit of patient safety monitoring methodologies that can be widely disseminated across health care systems that care for diverse populations.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term goal of this research is to reduce adverse events and errors in outpatient health care. This project is focused on approaches to measure and characterize adverse events in result notification and ongoing monitoring for high risk health conditions in safety net health care systems that care for diverse patient populations, including low-income and race/ ethnic minority groups. We aim to measure the extent of disparities in patient safety in ambulatory care settings and ways to understand underlying reasons for these disparities.            ",Investigating Failures of Notification and Monitoring in Outpatient Care: the Safety Promotion Action Research and Knowledge (SPARK) Network,9060041,R01HS024426,[''],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2015,482368,0.093501868934983
"ASPIRE: Advancing Safety Process Innovation in Rheumatology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite widespread recognition of pervasive patient safety problems in the U.S. health care system, research to develop feasible, scalable solutions has lagged, particularly in the ambulatory setting. The need for new approaches to improve safety is especially pressing in the care of ambulatory patients using high-risk immunosuppressive medications, as reports of preventable adverse events among this category of drugs have increased. To date, no studies have carefully defined the epidemiology of these safety risks. The proposed Advancing Safety Process Innovation Using Registries (ASPIRE) project will use advanced electronic health record (EHR) data analytics to define the magnitude of ambulatory patient safety errors and adverse events for patients receiving high risk medications (Aim 1). We will also characterize disparities in these risks across race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and medical complexity. Three categories of patient safety processes will be examined: 1) preventive practices that reduce adverse medication events, 2) safety monitoring for patients using high-risk immunosuppressive medications, and 3) management of abnormal results from medication toxicity monitoring. These findings will be used to inform the development of eMeasures, a new approach to quality measurement that uses automatically extracted EHR information to give clinicians and health systems information regarding specific patient safety problems (Aim 2). We will use eMeasurement standards, including the Quality Data Model (QDM), Health Quality Measures Format (HQMF) and other structured coded terminologies to develop, specify and test system-wide prototype eMeasures. HIT-solutions such as eMeasures that can be applied across EHR data repositories serve as a foundation for a continuous learning health care system, as envisioned by the Institute of Medicine. The work proposed here builds the groundwork for further testing and nationwide dissemination of eMeasures to monitor and improve safety for those using high-risk medications in the ambulatory setting.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ASPIRE project will use novel ways of analyzing data from electronic health records to study ambulatory patient safety errors and adverse events for patients receiving high-risk immunosuppressive medications. This information will be used to develop quality measures that are tailored to electronic health records (eMeasures) to monitor and reduce patient safety risks.            ",ASPIRE: Advancing Safety Process Innovation in Rheumatology,9059925,R01HS024412,[''],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2015,458458,0.08062084572750366
"UAW Hazardous Material Worker Health and Safety Training (U45) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The International Union, UAW proposes to train 2339 workers in the first year, providing 22,545 contact hours of training using 25 different curricula t worksites and at union-sponsored functions. The UAW will train 11,695 participants and provide 112,725 contact hours of training over the life of the project. We will expand the scope of an on-going program which provides training in hazardous waste operations, hazardous materials transportation, environmental restoration of contaminated site, emergency response and related health and safety topics. The long-term objective of this project is to prevent work-related harm by providing health and safety training to UAW members and members of communities disadvantaged by environmental injustice, limited English proficiency and/or lack of educational opportunity. The training will help them to protect themselves, their places of employment and their communities from exposure to hazardous materials. A special strength of this project is that it integrates the technical expertise of the UAW and the University of Michigan (U-M) in basic disciplines of health and safety, the practical experience of the UAW in addressing hazards at work, and the ongoing relationship of the UAW with trainees and management at worksites served. We plan to enhance collaboration with groups that serve populations with limited English proficiency, occupational health disparities and environmental justice challenges. To do so, we propose not just to deliver health and safety training to community members recruited by our partner organizations, but also to transfer health and safety training skills to te staffs of our partner organizations through train-the-trainer programs. Our partner organizations include:  - Catholic Charities Hispanic Outreach Services  - United Hispanic Workers of Detroit  - Macomb International Services Center  - Detroiters Working for Environmental Justice  - Green Door Initiative  - OAI Inc  The paramount goal of this project is to prevent work-related harm by training UAW members and others in how best to protect themselves and their communities from exposure to hazardous materials encountered during hazardous waste operations, hazardous materials transportation, environmental restoration of contaminated facilities and/or chemical emergency response. The specific aims are to:  1. Conduct training in health and safety topics directly or indirectly related to elimination and/or reduction of potential exposure o hazardous materials.  2. Develop new curricula on chemical safety and security, climate change, Ebola and other topics. Revise and expand existing curricula as needed. Integrate advanced training technology into new and revised curricula to improve the delivery of training (WETP Mission Priority 5).  3. Continue and intensify efforts to identify and target high-risk worksites for delivery of training.  4. Continue and expand collaborative partnerships with community groups and other NIEHS-WETP grantees. These partnerships will be particularly focused on addressing underserved workers, health disparities and environmental justice.  5. Conduct program evaluation, integrating use of worker-evaluators to provide feedback for continual improvement of curricula and delivery methods. This will include evaluating the long-term impact of IER training on worker and organizational outcomes.  6. Continue and expand a study that identifies factors contributing to suboptimal safety cultures and assesses the effectiveness of low cost intervention strategies to positively change suboptimal workplace safety cultures.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The International Union, UAW proposes to expand the scope of an on-going program whose long-term objective is to prevent the adverse consequences of exposure to hazardous materials by providing health and safety training to UAW members and members of communities disadvantaged by environmental injustice, limited English proficiency and/or lack of educational opportunity.

"Prevention Program to Reduce Injury Disparities Among Latino Day Laborers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latino day laborers (LDL) experience a disproportionately high rate of on-the-job injuries and fatalities compared with other workers in the U.S. The typical LDL is male, foreign-born, living below the poverty level and Spanish monolingual. In Texas, where most construction workers are LDL, 89 construction workers died on the job in 2010 - a rate of one death every 4 days. Some studies suggest that their injury rate may in fact be 3 to 4 times higher. Safety programs recommended for LDL have had limited success increasing their safety at work, partly because they do not consider the pressing needs confronted by these workers. These programs may have missed a critical component of injury prevention by failing to address psychosocial stressors that emerge from harsh living conditions and economic inequalities which amplify LDL risk for injury at work. Until safety programs are created to help LDL negotiate the hazards they face at work in the context of the psychosocial factors that amplify their risk, it will not be possible to effectively reduce the unacceptably hig risk LDL face of being injured or dying on the job. We are joining forces with our community partners to form a Community Advisory Board (CAB) consisting of day labor leaders, university-based researchers, and community-based and employer organizations to address this question: How can LDL increase their ability to effectively cope with the psychosocial factors that put them at increased risk of unintended injury at work? This study has the following aims: (1) Identify intervention priorities using a corner-based needs assessment to document occupational and psychosocial risk and protective factors that increase LDL risk for injury. (2) With the CAB, jointly design a culturally responsive and context appropriate OSHA 10-based safety intervention that also addresses psychosocial risks to reduce LDL injuries. (3) Collaboratively pilot a corner-level intervention and conduct an evaluation to assess the safety program's feasibility and acceptability as determined by the extent to which we can recruit, retain and follow-up LDL over the course of the study. Mitigating safety risks among LDL is an urgent public health priority to reduce unintended injuries, an area of research interest at the national Institute of Minority Health Disparities.         RELEVANCE (See instructions): This study will develop an intervention to increase safety practices among Latino day laborers. A needs assessment survey with this population will lead to modifications of the OSHA10 (a program recommended for Latino workers) based on priorities to target psychosocial factors that amplify risky conditions at work. The pilot test of his intervention will allow us to establish its feasibility and acceptability, as determined by the extnt to which we can recruit, retain and follow-up day laborers over the course of the study                  ",Prevention Program to Reduce Injury Disparities Among Latino Day Laborers,8804865,R24MD007975,"['Accidents ', ' Action Research ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Economical Conditions ', ' Economic Conditions ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Equipment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Gases ', ' Industry ', ' Institutes ', ' Justice ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' male ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Perception ', ' Poverty ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rights ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Occupational Health ', ' Latino ', ' injury prevention ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Workplace ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' role model ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Inequality ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Occupational ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' hazard ', ' skills ', ' Prevention program ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Contractor ', ' Monitor ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' minority health ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' health economics ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' safety practice ', ' high risk ', ' public health priorities ', ' burden of injury ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R24,2015,349547,0.1809436686036156
"The Penn Violence and Injury Control Research Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose the Penn Violence and Injury Control Research Center (PVICRC) as a developmental ICRC whose focus is the reduction of violence and injuries among low-resourced populations through the highest caliber science, education, and outreach. The proposed Center will bring together university, community, and government partners around injury and violence intervention programs with the highest potential for impact. These high impact programs will typically have three cardinal features; they will: make structural changes (for example, to places), be scalable to cover large populations, and be sustainable over long periods of time. Injury prevention among low-resourced populations faces unique issues of poverty, poor community engagement, eroding physical and service infrastructures, growing health disparities, and structural stressors in the surrounding environment that have, heretofore, been under-studied by violence and injury prevention researchers. While not ignoring the importance of rural injuries, a primary focus of the proposed Center would be to build more effective and efficient approaches to reduce violence and injury in an urban context by focusing on the intersections of environment, biology and behavior. In doing so, this developmental ICRC will build the infrastructure and capacity for a sustained, comprehensive injury center that will use research, education and outreach to prevent injuries more broadly for vulnerable, low-resourced communities. The Center's current academic and clinical environment is rich in resources for injury science, education and outreach, but has historically lacked a centralized structure dedicated to the development and maintenance of high caliber injury research scientists, training, translation, and outreach. The goal of this developmental Center is to promote and perform the highest quality research, training and translation of scientific discoveries into practice and policy, in order to reduce injuries, violence and their impact nationwide, particularly among vulnerable urban populations. The proposed developmental Center is organized around two cores, the Administrative Core and the Training, Education and Outreach (TEO) Core, a Planning Board, and a Centerpiece Research Project, a 3-arm randomized community intervention trial of actual changes to vacant and abandoned spaces in Philadelphia to scientifically assess the impact of these changes on violence. Led by the Administrative Core, the TEO Core, a Planning Board, and a Centerpiece Research Project will collaborate to complete important research, training and translation activities while, at the same time, engaging the Penn community, as well as local and national stakeholders, in the planning, implementation, and advancement of a fully funded and sustainable comprehensive ICRC.

"Racial Disparities in the Economic Outcomes of Work-Related Disabilities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There has been considerable public effort to identify, understand and eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in health and economic opportunities in the United States. A body of work has demonstrated the presence of wide disparities in population health across different subsets of the population, with racial and ethnic minorities subject to significantly higher morbidity and mortality from chronic disease on average. In addition to disparities in health, there is also widespread evidence documenting disparities in economic opportunity, with racial and ethnic minorities consistently earning lower pay for comparable work.  While there are well-established disparities in health and earnings in minority populations, it is less understood how different sections of the population are affected by accidents in the workplace. Work-related injuries and disabilities impose large costs on society, and often have significant and lasting impacts on labor market outcomes for injured workers. Past studies have considered how the frequency and severity of occupational injuries differs across different racial and ethnic groups, but with relatively few definitive conclusions. In particular, it is largely unknown how the economic outcomes of injuries differ according to race. Conceptually, this is a difficult question to answer. On the one hand, the fact that most minorities have fewer employment opportunities means that they are less likely to work and thus face less exposure to workplace injury risk. However, when they do work they tend to work in riskier jobs, increasing their potential risk. Moreover, the effect of injuries on economic outcomes is complicated by their baseline disparities in employment and health. More work is needed to understand racial differences in economic outcomes after a workplace injury.  Our study would address this issue and provide new evidence about racial and ethnic disparities in employment and earnings after a work-related disability. We will use data from a large, national survey with detailed information on employment, earnings, demographic characteristics and disability. We will use instrumental variables to estimate racial disparities in the frequency and severity of injuries independent of measurement error or selection bias. Finally, we will conduct statistical tests to identify how much of these disparities can be explained by observed characteristics and how much is unexplained and due to other factors such as discrimination. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This goal of this study is to provide new evidence about racial and ethnic disparities in employment and earnings after a work-related disability. We will use data from a large, national survey with detailed information on employment, earnings, demographic characteristics and disability, and use instrumental variable methods to estimate racial disparities in the frequency and severity of injuries independent of measurement error or selection bias.

"Alcohol and Pedestrian Injury: Inquiry into Built and Social Environment Factors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this fellowship is to prepare the applicant, Elizabeth Nesoff, for an academic research career in the intersecting fields of alcohol and injury prevention. The proposed fellowship consists of two complimentary components: (1) A research project examining the relationship between alcohol outlet density and pedestrian injury in Baltimore City, with an emphasis on the impact of both the built and social environment on pedestrian injury in areas of greater alcohol outlet density; (2) A comprehensive training plan comprised of advanced coursework; mentorship in the content areas of alcohol epidemiology, environmental observational, spatial analysis, and health disparities research; dissemination of results through manuscripts and scientific presentations; and experience working on ongoing alcohol and [injury prevention] projects in Baltimore City. The proposed training program is designed around a research project that will examine the relationship between alcohol outlet density and pedestrian injury in Baltimore City, with an emphasis on the impact of both the built and social environment on pedestrian injury in areas of greater alcohol outlet density. The applicant hypothesizes that more pedestrian injuries occur in areas of greater alcohol outlet density. Additionally, she hypothesizes that more pedestrian injuries occur in areas of greater resource deprivation and physical disorder, and in areas of greater social disorganization and incivility. Finally, she hypothesizes that there is a synergistic effect between physical and socia disorder that contributes to increased pedestrian injuries in areas of greater alcohol outlet density.  This project is supported by a strong, interdisciplinary team of mentors and consultants, including faculty members with backgrounds in [alcohol epidemiology, health disparities, biostatistics and spatial analysis, and injury prevention.] Dr. Debra Furr-Holden, the project Sponsor, is an authority in measurement of drug and alcohol use disorders; design and evaluation of alcohol-related interventions; and methods to reduce health disparities. Dr. Andrea Gielen, the project Co-Sponsor, is an expert in translating research to disseminate proven injury prevention interventions in clinical and community settings, specifically in low income, urban neighborhoods. Their mentorship will be complemented by that of Dr. Frank Curriero, an expert in spatial analysis; Dr. Keshia Pollack, an expert in injury prevention and the built environment; and Dr. Janice Bowie, an expert in behavioral, social and structural factors related to health disparities.  This fellowship will facilitate the applicant's expertise in the intersection of observational epidemiology, GIS methodology, and the alcohol environment and injury prevention. Her professional development includes not only her personal research development, but her capacity to cultivate future investigators in this understudied but important area of publi health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study has implications for understanding the impact of alcohol outlet density on unintentional injury, as well as increasing the evidence base to inform decisions about liquor store licensing and enforcement. The proposed study may have important implications for policy interventions and community-level behavioral health interventions addressing alcohol use and abuse, as well as injury prevention.

"Functional Characterization of ALI-Associated MYLK SNPs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute lung injury (ALI) is a disorder affecting over 200,000 U.S. patients per year and has an unacceptably high mortality of 30-35%. The pathophysiology of ALI centers on inflammation-induced disruption of the endothelial cell (EC) barrier lining the pulmonary vasculature, causing leakage of fluid, protein, and cells into the airspaces. Pulmonary endothelial barrier maintenance and recovery from injury is dependent on EC cytoskeletal dynamics. Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) is a multi-functional cytoskeletal effector protein that is a key regulator of barrier function and has been a focus of the Garcia lab for over 20 years. This work has clearly established that barrier-disrupting edemagenic agonists produce spatially localized MLC phosphorylation within cytoplasmic contractile stress fibers, resulting in actomyosin contraction, tension, and formation of paracellular gaps. In contrast, barrier-protective agonists induce nmMLCK translocation to cortical actin networks and into lamellipodial membrane protrusions designed to close paracellular gaps and restore barrier integrity. Additionally, nmMLCK regulates lung trafficking of inflammatory cells and is robustly activated by biophysical forces such as excessive mechanical stress, which underlies its implications in ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). Furthermore, levels of nmMLCK expression and enzymatic activity contribute to risk and severity of ALI and VILI in preclinical models and human samples. Previously, the Garcia lab has identified a haplotype of three coding SNPs (Pro21His, Ser147Pro, Val261Ala, ""3XSNP"") in the nmMLCK gene (MYLK) that is highly associated with increased ALI susceptibility and severe asthma.  This three SNP haplotype is significantly more common in individuals of African descent (AD) and likely contributes to the significant health disparities in ALI incidence and mortality. We hypothesize that these ALI-associated MYLK SNPs alter the structure of nmMLCK and that these structural changes impair lamellipodial activity and paracellular gap closure in response to inflammatory injury. We plan to perform functional studies of known MYLK SNPs using sophisticated biophysical and ultrastructural techniques including trans-endothelial resistance (TER) measurement, confocal microscopy and co-localization, kymography and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Subsequently, we plan to validate the clinical relevance of these SNPs in established preclinical models of ALI and VILI and clarify nmMLCK antagonism as a novel ALI therapeutic strategy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute lung injury (ALI), a complex disorder with an unacceptably high mortality rate of 35%, is characterized by inflammation-induced disruption of the endothelial cell barrier that lines the pulmonary vasculature, resulting in leakage of fluid, protein, and cells into the airspaces of the lung. Myosin light chain kinase is a cytoskeletal regulatory protein that is critically involved in endothelial barrier regulation. The proposed research aims to functionally characterize ALI-associated polymorphisms (SNPs) in the myosin light chain kinase gene (MYLK) at the cellular level and validate these findings in established preclinical models of ALI and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).",Functional Characterization of ALI-Associated MYLK SNPs,9118329,F30HL121982,"['Actins ', ' Actomyosin ', ' Affect ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Endothelium ', ' Spillage ', ' Leakage ', ' Extravasation ', ' Genes ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kymography ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Maintenance ', ' mortality ', ' smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase ', ' Myosin light chain kinase 2, skeletal/cardiac muscle ', ' Myosin Regulatory Light-Chain Kinase ', ' Myosin Light Polypeptide Kinase ', ' Myosin Light Chain Kinase, Smooth Muscle and Non-Muscle Isozymes ', ' Myosin LCK ', ' Myosin Kinase ', ' MYLK2 ', ' EC 2.7.1.117 ', ' Myosin Light Chain Kinase ', ' Patients ', ' Protein Phosphorylation ', ' Phosphorylation ', ' polymorphism ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Proteins ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stress ', ' Mechanical Stress ', ' Work ', ' Ventilator ', ' Injury ', ' Acute ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' African ', ' Measurement ', ' Acute Pulmonary Injury ', ' Acute Lung Injury ', ' Confocal Microscopy ', ' Agonist ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Equus asinus ', ' Donkey ', ' Asses ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' restoration ', ' membrane structure ', ' Membrane ', ' FRET ', ' Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer ', ' trafficking ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' regulatory gene product ', ' Regulatory Protein ', ' genetic regulatory protein ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Focal Contacts ', ' Cell-Matrix Adherens Junctions ', ' Adhesion Plaques ', ' Focal Adhesions ', ' Stress Fibers ', ' prolylserine ', ' Pro-Ser ', ' prolyl-serine ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' VEGFs ', ' Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors ', ' Preclinical Models ', ' Pre-Clinical Model ', ' in vivo ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Ventilator-induced lung injury ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,F30,2016,40404,0.0294428189465011
"Investigating Failures of Notification and Monitoring in Outpatient Care: the Safety Promotion Action Research and Knowledge (SPARK) Network ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ensuring patient safety remains a critical issue for health care systems. In particular, ambulatory (outpatient) health care settings are vulnerable to patient safety concerns. The majority of health care is delivered in ambulatory settings, with 1.2 billion outpatient visits annually in the United States (U.S.). Between failures of monitoring, and missed and delayed diagnosis, there is significant morbidity and mortality from patient safety problems in outpatient care. Although strides have been made in recognizing and preventing adverse events, little is known about the epidemiology of patient safety in ambulatory care settings and factors that contribute to these disparities. The overall goals of this proposal are t examine the epidemiology of patient safety in ambulatory care settings that care for diverse, low-income populations as follows; (1) to characterize the incidence and prevalence of specific safety gaps, by race/ ethnicity and language proficiency; (2) to gather in- depth, qualitative evidence about strategies that can improve safety and characterize disparities in patient safety; (3) to pilot-test patient safety monitoring methodologies in a diverse sample of five safety net health care systems; and (4) to develop a measurement and error investigation toolkit for dissemination amongst safety-net health care systems. Specifically, we will identify the extent of missed notification for actionable test results and extent of missed monitoring for high-risk populations. These two process gaps, periodic monitoring of high-risk conditions and notification of actionable abnormal test results, both lead to preventable patient harm. While these care gaps are documented, the extent of disparities in harm and the populations at highest risk remain unclear. To further deepen this knowledge, we will elucidate underlying causes for these safety gaps, focusing on disparities we identify in the data. Finally, we aim to give safety-net health systems participating in this study the methodological tools to conduct measurement of these safety gaps and perform event investigation, in order to set the stage for future improvement and innovation work to close gaps in disparities. We propose a collaborative Safety Promotion Action Research and Knowledge Network (SPARK Network) to achieve the following specific aims: 1) to develop feasible, timely, and accurate electronic measures of patient safety notification and monitoring gaps in an ambulatory care setting for high-risk sub- populations and characterize the extent of disparities in patient safety; 2) to conduct a root cause analysis of patient safety notification/ monitoring gaps in five public ambulatory care settings to identify factors contributing to these disparities; and 3) to evaluate the pilot implementation of patient safety monitoring methodologies developed from Aims 1 and 2 across five diverse ambulatory health care settings. We envision that pilot findings from this project wil result in a measurement and root cause analysis toolkit of patient safety monitoring methodologies that can be widely disseminated across health care systems that care for diverse populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term goal of this research is to reduce adverse events and errors in outpatient health care. This project is focused on approaches to measure and characterize adverse events in result notification and ongoing monitoring for high risk health conditions in safety net health care systems that care for diverse patient populations, including low-income and race/ ethnic minority groups. We aim to measure the extent of disparities in patient safety in ambulatory care settings and ways to understand underlying reasons for these disparities.",Investigating Failures of Notification and Monitoring in Outpatient Care: the Safety Promotion Action Research and Knowledge (SPARK) Network,9150529,R01HS024426,[''],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,481970,0.093501868934983
"A Brief Intervention to Increase Size-Appropriate Child Passenger Restraint Use DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) remain a leading cause of death among children after the first year of life despite substantial improvements in passenger safety. In 2007, more children ages 1 to 12 years died as occupants in MVCs than died of heart disease, influenza/pneumonia, or sepsis. Deaths and severe injuries from MVCs can be reduced significantly through the consistent use of size-appropriate child passenger restraints. Still 10% of children ride completely unrestrained and roughly one-quarter do not use the recommended restraint for their size. New approaches are needed to motivate behavior change among parents who do not consistently use size-appropriate passenger restraints for their 1- to 12-year-old children. Emergency department (ED) visits represent unique opportunities to reach vulnerable children and their parents who have difficulty accessing the primary care settings where childhood injury prevention information is commonly provided. Motivational interviewing (MI) in the ED has been used to encourage a variety of health behaviors among at-risk patients. However, MI has not been previously evaluated for child passenger safety promotion programs. This career development award will provide Dr. Macy with the additional skill set and advanced research training required to develop and evaluate an ED-based intervention utilizing MI techniques and patient-centered (e.g., targeted and tailored) print materials to promote the correct and consistent use of size-appropriate child passenger restraints. Dr. Macy has developed the proposed research and career development plans under the guidance of her experienced multidisciplinary mentoring team that includes experts in the fields of health communications for behavior change, injury prevention, and pediatric health services research. The proposal is organized into 4 phases: (1) audience segmentation analysis of survey data obtained from parents of 1- to 12-year-old children seeking ED care in order to identify distinct child passenger restraint use subgroups for the development of targeted interventions; (2) focus groups with parents in order to obtain an in-depth understanding of the subgroups identified in Phase 1 and to pilot test child passenger safety messages intended for these subgroups; (3) development of intervention materials including brief MI messages, targeted information sheets, and tailored brochures; and (4) randomized pilot trial of the intervention utilizing a 2x2 factorial design to examine the independent and additive effects of ED-based MI and tailored print materials on the consistent use of size-appropriate child passenger restraints. Dr. Macy's career development activities will include formal training in statistical analysis for audience segmentation, qualitative methods, and advance theories and applied techniques related to the design and implementation of behavioral interventions in the ED setting. Through formal coursework, interaction with her highly qualified mentoring team, and the execution of the proposed project, Dr. Macy will acquire the knowledge and skills to become an independent researcher and expert in ED-based interventions for pediatric injury prevention. Preventable injuries sustained by child occupants in motor vehicle collisions are a significant and costly public health concern. Child passenger restraint systems have proven effective in reducing the risk of injury and death associated with a motor vehicle collision, yet there are few evidence-based approaches to promote the correct and consistent use of the size-appropriate child passenger restraint. By using successful strategies for behavior change, including motivational interviewing and personalized health communication, the proposed intervention could remarkably improve passenger safety among children who contact the health system through the emergency department.",A Brief Intervention to Increase Size-Appropriate Child Passenger Restraint Use,9010965,K23HD070913,"['adulthood ', ' Adult

"EMRSHN: Exploring the modulatory role of sex hormones along the neuromechanical axis in females The rate of musculoskeletal injury differs substantially between men and women, with the incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries up to 9 times higher in female athletes. These injuries cause short- and long- term health problems, including time lost from school or work, psychological distress, and post-injury joint osteoarthritis. Sex hormones may make a significant contribution to this injury disparity: injury rate differences are not evident until puberty, and injuries occur disproportionately in the first half of the menstrual cycle. While most research has focused on passive components of the musculoskeletal system, arguing that female fluctuating hormone concentrations may change mechanical properties of the ligament itself, a direct link between ligament laxity and ACL injury has not been proven. The goal of this proposal is to test our central hypothesis that changes in sex hormone concentration result in changes to the basic elements of motor control – at multiple levels, from the musculotendinous unit to motor control circuitry. In our preliminary data, at the muscle level, we have shown that the muscle reflex response is lowest when estradiol concentrations are highest, with no change in anterior knee laxity. At the spinal circuitry level, we have shown that while day-to-day changes in hormone concentration do not modulate spinal motor neuronal excitability, a lower overall level of excitability exists in women who take oral contraceptives. Finally, at the level of the brain, we have shown the excitability of intra-cortical interneuronal circuits is increased when estradiol concentrations are highest. In Aims 1 & 2 of our proposal, daily testing will allow, as never-before, a detailed assessment of the time-specific relationship between hormone concentration and changes at the muscle and spinal level during both relaxed and active states. In Aim 3, daily hormone concentrations will specifically determine each subject's testing day, guiding targeted assessments into the role of fluctuating hormone concentrations on cortical excitability. In Aim 1 we will determine the influence of sex hormone fluctuations on the muscle stretch reflex during active and passive states, and the time-lag between hormone concentration changes and the reflex response. We will use a technically simple assessment that could be implemented in the field. In Aim 2 we will determine the influence of sex hormone fluctuations on spinal motor neuron excitability using H-reflex as a probe and the simultaneous change in the muscle mechanics using muscle twitch response. Aims 1 & 2 will include a focus on the differential role of oral contraceptives. In Aim 3 we will use paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation during active contraction to determine the influence of sex hormone fluctuations on cortical excitability in naturally cycling women. Our findings have the potential to guide future research in injury prevention strategies, including targeted neuromuscular training. This knowledge will enable clinicians to educate female patients on neuromuscular effects of sex hormones during times of high fluctuations, including puberty, pregnancy, and menopause. Sex hormone concentrations fluctuate across the menstrual cycle, which may play a significant role in the substantially higher rate of knee injury in female athletes than in males. The goal of this proposal is to test our central hypothesis that sex hormone fluctuations result in changes to the basic elements of motor control along the full neuro-muscular axis – from muscle to the brain. Our findings have the potential to guide future research in injury prevention strategies, and the knowledge gained will enable clinicians to educate female patients on neuromuscular effects of sex hormones during times of high fluctuations, including puberty, pregnancy, and menopause.",EMRSHN: Exploring the modulatory role of sex hormones along the neuromechanical axis in females,9176667,R01AR069176,"['Affect ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Contraceptives ', ' Contraceptive Agents ', ' birth control pill ', ' Oral Contraceptives ', ' Elements ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estradiol ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' H-Reflex ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Incidence ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Knee Injuries ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Ligaments ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' menopausal ', ' Female Change of Life ', ' Menopause ', ' Menstrual cycle ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' motoneuron ', ' Motor Cell ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Muscle ', ' Musculoskeletal System ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Therapeutic Progesterone ', ' Pregnenedione ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione ', ' Delta4-pregnene-3,20-dione ', ' Corpus Luteum Hormone ', ' Progesterone ', ' Puberty ', ' Reflex ', ' Reflex action ', ' myotatic reflex ', ' muscle spindle reflex ', ' stretch reflex ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' sex steroid ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Anterior Cruciate Ligament ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Glean ', ' injury prevention ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Anterior ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' tibialis anterior ', ' Anterior Tibial Muscle ', ' tibialis anterior muscle ', ' injury of musculoskeleted system ', ' injury of musculoskeletal system (disorder) ', ' musculoskeletal injury ', ' digital reflex ', "" Hoffmann's sign "", "" Hoffman's Reflex "", ' Knowledge ', ' Torque ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' joint trauma ', ' joint damage ', ' joint injury ', ' ligament damage ', ' damage to ligament ', ' ligament injury ', ' Transcranial magnetic stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Hormonal ', ' Spinal ', ' experience ', ' stimulus interval ', ' cohort ', ' Stretching ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Reporting ', ' psychological distress ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' resistance training ', ' muscle strengthening ', ' strength training ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' hormonal regulation ', ' hormone regulation ', ' pill ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' quadriceps ', ' quadriceps muscle ', ' sex ', ' Output ', ' neuromuscular ', ' neuronal excitability ', ' Neuromechanics ', ' neuromechanical ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' motor control ', ' rectus femoris ', ' ']",NIAMS,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2016,695546,0.15273042452512595

"Alcohol and Pedestrian Injury: Inquiry into Built and Social Environment Factors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this fellowship is to prepare the applicant, Elizabeth Nesoff, for an academic research career in the intersecting fields of alcohol and injury prevention. The proposed fellowship consists of two complimentary components: (1) A research project examining the relationship between alcohol outlet density and pedestrian injury in Baltimore City, with an emphasis on the impact of both the built and social environment on pedestrian injury in areas of greater alcohol outlet density; (2) A comprehensive training plan comprised of advanced coursework; mentorship in the content areas of alcohol epidemiology, environmental observational, spatial analysis, and health disparities research; dissemination of results through manuscripts and scientific presentations; and experience working on ongoing alcohol and [injury prevention] projects in Baltimore City. The proposed training program is designed around a research project that will examine the relationship between alcohol outlet density and pedestrian injury in Baltimore City, with an emphasis on the impact of both the built and social environment on pedestrian injury in areas of greater alcohol outlet density. The applicant hypothesizes that more pedestrian injuries occur in areas of greater alcohol outlet density. Additionally, she hypothesizes that more pedestrian injuries occur in areas of greater resource deprivation and physical disorder, and in areas of greater social disorganization and incivility. Finally, she hypothesizes that there is a synergistic effect between physical and socia disorder that contributes to increased pedestrian injuries in areas of greater alcohol outlet density.  This project is supported by a strong, interdisciplinary team of mentors and consultants, including faculty members with backgrounds in [alcohol epidemiology, health disparities, biostatistics and spatial analysis, and injury prevention.] Dr. Debra Furr-Holden, the project Sponsor, is an authority in measurement of drug and alcohol use disorders; design and evaluation of alcohol-related interventions; and methods to reduce health disparities.

"Disparities in Disability after Traumatic Brain Injury for Hispanic Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability for children in the U.S. Disability after TBI is higher among children with no or government insurance, poor family functioning and lower levels of parental education. In a preliminary study, we documented disparities in long term disability after TBI for Hispanic children; Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) children experience significantly larger reductions in health related quality of life, participation in activities, and ability to communicate and care for themselves 3 years after injury. It is unclear if use of rehabilitation services and/or cultural and language barriers contributed to the documented differences. We propose a three-phase research plan to compare patterns and determinants of utilization of rehabilitation services and its association with disability outcomes between Hispanic, NHW and non-Hispanic Black (NHB) children. We will also develop and pilot-test the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally tailored intervention to reduce barriers for use of rehabilitation services by Hispanic children with TBI. The long term goal of this K23 award is for the candidate to develop as an independent researcher in the area of patient outcomes in vulnerable populations and pediatric trauma disparities research. The K23 candidate is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at the University of Washington. The candidate proposes a five-year training plan with the support of faculty mentors who have expertise in injury outcomes research, community based participatory research, qualitative methods, and intervention trials in minority communities. The University of Washington, Seattle Children's Hospital, and Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center provide excellent institutional support and resources for this award. The research involves three studies. Study 1 will compare use of inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services between Hispanic, NHB and NHW pediatric patients with TBI, and its association with disability. Study 2 will compare predisposing enabling and need factors for use of outpatient rehabilitation services between the three ethnic groups. Study 3 will develop and pilot-test a culturally tailored intervention to reduce barriers fr use of rehabilitation services by Hispanic children with TBI. These studies will expand our understanding of the potential reasons for disparities in the provision of care for children with TBI. It will clarify the role of Hispanic ethnicity in the receipt of rehabilitation care and highe risk of disability after TBI, independent of socioeconomic and minority status. It will lay the groundwork for a multicenter study to evaluate a culturally tailored intervention to reduce barriers for use of rehabilitation services by Hispanic families, which can also serve as a model for other vulnerable populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Significant disparities in long term disability after traumatic brain injury (TBI) exist for Hispanic children. Identifying patterns and determinants for use of rehabilitation services after TBI will reveal risk factors that can allow intervention strategies t be targeted more effectively to Hispanic Children and other vulnerable populations.

"ASPIRE: Advancing Safety Process Innovation in Rheumatology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite widespread recognition of pervasive patient safety problems in the U.S. health care system, research to develop feasible, scalable solutions has lagged, particularly in the ambulatory setting. The need for new approaches to improve safety is especially pressing in the care of ambulatory patients using high-risk immunosuppressive medications, as reports of preventable adverse events among this category of drugs have increased. To date, no studies have carefully defined the epidemiology of these safety risks. The proposed Advancing Safety Process Innovation Using Registries (ASPIRE) project will use advanced electronic health record (EHR) data analytics to define the magnitude of ambulatory patient safety errors and adverse events for patients receiving high risk medications (Aim 1). We will also characterize disparities in these risks across race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and medical complexity. Three categories of patient safety processes will be examined: 1) preventive practices that reduce adverse medication events, 2) safety monitoring for patients using high-risk immunosuppressive medications, and 3) management of abnormal results from medication toxicity monitoring. These findings will be used to inform the development of eMeasures, a new approach to quality measurement that uses automatically extracted EHR information to give clinicians and health systems information regarding specific patient safety problems (Aim 2). We will use eMeasurement standards, including the Quality Data Model (QDM), Health Quality Measures Format (HQMF) and other structured coded terminologies to develop, specify and test system-wide prototype eMeasures. HIT-solutions such as eMeasures that can be applied across EHR data repositories serve as a foundation for a continuous learning health care system, as envisioned by the Institute of Medicine. The work proposed here builds the groundwork for further testing and nationwide dissemination of eMeasures to monitor and improve safety for those using high-risk medications in the ambulatory setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ASPIRE project will use novel ways of analyzing data from electronic health records to study ambulatory patient safety errors and adverse events for patients receiving high-risk immunosuppressive medications. This information will be used to develop quality measures that are tailored to electronic health records (eMeasures) to monitor and reduce patient safety risks.",ASPIRE: Advancing Safety Process Innovation in Rheumatology,9147590,R01HS024412,[''],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2016,484042,0.08062084572750366
"Chemokine-related acute lung injury pathogenesis in African-American patients DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Kirsten Kangelaris, a hospitalist at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Kangelaris is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented clinical research in acute lung injury (ALI), with a focus on understanding biologic and genetic factors that impact susceptibility to and prognosis in acute lung injury among African-American patients. This K23 award will provide Dr. Kangelaris with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert patient-oriented clinical and translational researcher in acute lung injury; (2) to elucidate genetic and biologic mechanisms of acute lung injury combining innovative approaches including genetics, protein markers and functional genomics; (3) to implement advanced biostatistical techniques in clinical studies, including advanced regression and bioinformatics; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Kangelaris has assembled a multidisciplinary team comprised of a primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, who has extensive experience in translational, pathogenesis-oriented ALI research, and in mentoring junior faculty to independent investigators, and two co-mentors: Dr. Elad Ziv, an expert in genetic mapping in admixed populations, and Dr. Bradley Aouizerat, a leader in genomics and molecular epidemiology. Additionally, Dr. Kangelaris will benefit from the expertise of several scientific advisors. Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common cause of acute respiratory failure in hospitalized patients, and African Americans suffer the highest ALI incidence and mortality rates. Dr. Kangelaris' research plan builds on her preliminary data to examine chemokine-dependent pathways of ALI pathogenesis in African-American patients. She will study the role of a functional polymorphism in the Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines gene (Darc -46C/C, rs2814778), prevalent in individuals of African descent, that has been associated with worse ALI outcomes in her preliminary work, possibly via an increase in circulating interleukin (IL)-8. Dr. Kangelaris will test the extent to which this so-called ""Dufy null"" genotype is associated with susceptibility to acute lung injury (Aim 1), determine whether the Duffy null genotype is associated with differences in Duffy- binding chemokine levels (e.g., IL-8) and biomarkers of injury among patients with acute lung injury (Aim 2), and to use whole blood gene expression to identify chemokine-related pathways of acute lung injury pathogenesis in African-American patients (Aim 3). This research plan makes use of the existing infrastructure of Dr. Carolyn Calfee's Early Assessment of Renal and Lung Injury (EARLI) cohort at UCSF and Dr. Lorraine Ware's Validation of biomarkers in Acute Lung Injury Diagnosis (VALID) cohort at Vanderbilt University. This research will form the basis for an R01-level application to study the association between chemokine-related genomic and protein markers and acute lung injury susceptibility and outcomes in African-American patients. Public Health Relevance Identification of genetic and biologic factors that contribute to acute lung injury pathogenesis among African American patients is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to personalized risk assessment, improved early management and targeted treatments for these patients. Additionally, identification of novel mechanisms of disease in a high risk population will expand our basic understanding of the pathogenesis of acute lung injury relevant in other

"Evaluating a Web-based Child Passenger Safety Program:  Safety in Seconds v 2.0 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is a revision of 1RO1HD069221. We are addressing the need for innovative research on prevention in the context of emergency medical services, specifically evaluation of behavior change interventions using computer technology. We propose to test a web based, theory driven, computer-tailored intervention for child passenger safety in two Pediatric Emergency Departments (PEDs) and a Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Service (PTS) that serve diverse populations. The focus of this proposal is on parents' use of child restraint devices (CRDs) -- Car Safety Seats (CSS) and Belt-Positioning Booster Seats (BPBS) -- for their children ages 8 years and younger. These safety behaviors were chosen because they are effective countermeasures known to help prevent motor vehicle occupant injuries, the leading cause of child mortality in the United States. Although CSS use with younger children is common, there are disparities across populations, BPBS use for older children is low, and misuse of CRDs is widespread.  Our previous work, including the NICHD-funded study of Safety in Seconds (SIS) and that of others, has demonstrated that computer-tailored interventions can be feasible and effective in clinical settings, including PEDs. However, our work is the only research to our knowledge applying this technology to the specific issues of CSS and BPBS and the first to use it with Spanish speaking families. The original SIS was a kiosk-based, computer tailored program that demonstrated some success in a low income, urban, and predominantly African-American population in a single PED. This proposal will test an enhanced web-based program, Safety in Seconds v 2.0 (SIS v2.0), with English and Spanish speaking families from Baltimore, MD and Little Rock, AR. We will also extend our prior work by adding several elements never previously considered: testing the program in a PTS; testing a Spanish language version; and adding text messaging reminders and a web portal that can be accessed multiple times to reinforce the educational messages. Evaluating the program's cost benefit and determining barriers and facilitators to program adoption and implementation are also innovative aspects of the proposed work that will contribute to future dissemination.  The specific aims of the study are to: 1) evaluate the impact of a web-based, tailored program on English and Spanish speaking parents' child passenger safety knowledge, prevention beliefs, and the proper and consistent use of CSS and BPBS for their children ages 0-8; 2) evaluate the cost benefit ratio of the program for parents' utilization of BPBS for their children; and 3) determine the barriers and facilitators to program adoption and implementation in both PED and PTS settings. This 5-year study will take place in the Johns Hopkins PED (JH-PED) and the Johns Hopkins PTS (JH-PTS) as well as in the Arkansas Children's Hospital PED (AR-PED). Methods include: a) a modification of the existing Safety in Seconds program to convert it to a web-based platform and incorporate additional video, audio, texting reminders and repeat visit capabilities; b) a randomized controlled trial with 1,650 parents (600 JH-PED, 450 JH-PTS, 600 AR-PED), including baseline and 6-month follow up assessments and CSS observations; c) a cost benefit analysis of the program's expected financial benefit from the perspective of a third party payer of medical claims; and d) an in-depth examination of program adoption and implementation in all three study settings using qualitative data collected from key informant interviews, direct observations of the clinic environments, and document review.  With the ever-growing access to computers, results of this work will have widespread utility for disseminating effective CSS and BPBS behavior change programs to a broad audience, and we will advance the application of computer tailoring theories and methods in a new area. This proposal will evaluate an innovative web-based program -- Safety in Seconds v 2.0 - to increase the proper and consistent use of Car Safety Seats and Belt-Positioning Booster Seats for children ages 8 years and younger. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for children and child restraint devices are proven to reduce the risk of death and injury. The program will be evaluated in pediatric emergency departments and a pediatric trauma center with both English and Spanish speaking families. We will also complete a cost benefit analysis of the program and a study of how to implement the program in other settings.",Evaluating a Web-based Child Passenger Safety Program:  Safety in Seconds v 2.0,9008048,R01HD069221,"['Adoption ', ' Age ', ' Arkansas ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Cause of Death ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Mortality ', ' Computers ', ' cost benefit effectiveness ', ' cost benefit economics ', ' Cost Benefit Analyses ', ' Cost-Benefit Analysis ', ' Costs and Benefits ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Elements ', ' emergency service ', ' Emergency medical service ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Methods ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Parents ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Seat Belts ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' trauma centers ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Third-Party Payer ', ' injury prevention ', ' Injury ', ' Motor Vehicles ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' restraint ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' success ', ' prevention service ', ' Prevention ', ' Devices ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' knowledge resources ', ' knowledge resource ', ' information resource ', ' Information Resources ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Modification ', ' Text ', ' informant ', ' safety study ', ' childhood trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' pediatric injury ', ' injury in children ', ' child injury ', ' Childhood Injury ', ' cost efficient ', ' Population ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 8 year old ', ' eight year old ', ' age 8 years ', ' follow up assessment ', ' Emergency Department Physician ', ' Emergency room physician ', ' Emergency Physician ', ' ER physician ', ' ED Physician ', ' Medical emergency ', ' web portal ', ' internet portal ', ' ']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,506610,0.12811259604021671

"The Penn Violence and Injury Control Research Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose the Penn Violence and Injury Control Research Center (PVICRC) as a developmental ICRC whose focus is the reduction of violence and injuries among low-resourced populations through the highest caliber science, education, and outreach. The proposed Center will bring together university, community, and government partners around injury and violence intervention programs with the highest potential for impact. These high impact programs will typically have three cardinal features; they will: make structural changes (for example, to places), be scalable to cover large populations, and be sustainable over long periods of time. Injury prevention among low-resourced populations faces unique issues of poverty, poor community engagement, eroding physical and service infrastructures, growing health disparities, and structural stressors in the surrounding environment that have, heretofore, been under-studied by violence and injury prevention researchers. While not ignoring the importance of rural injuries, a primary focus of the proposed Center would be to build more effective and efficient approaches to reduce violence and injury in an urban context by focusing on the intersections of environment, biology and behavior. In doing so, this developmental ICRC will build the infrastructure and capacity for a sustained, comprehensive injury center that will use research, education and outreach to prevent injuries more broadly for vulnerable, low-resourced communities. The Center's current academic and clinical environment is rich in resources for injury science, education and outreach, but has historically lacked a centralized structure dedicated to the development and maintenance of high caliber injury research scientists, training, translation, and outreach. The goal of this developmental Center is to promote and perform the highest quality research, training and translation of scientific discoveries into practice and policy, in order to reduce injuries, violence and their impact nationwide, particularly among vulnerable urban populations. The proposed developmental Center is organized around two cores, the Administrative Core and the Training, Education and Outreach (TEO) Core, a Planning Board, and a Centerpiece Research Project, a 3-arm randomized community intervention trial of actual changes to vacant and abandoned spaces in Philadelphia to scientifically assess the impact of these changes on violence. Led by the Administrative Core, the TEO Core, a Planning Board, and a Centerpiece Research Project will collaborate to complete important research, training and translation activities while, at the same time, engaging the Penn community, as well as local and national stakeholders, in the planning, implementation, and advancement of a fully funded and sustainable comprehensive ICRC.

The proposed Center would bring together university, community, and government partners around programs with the highest potential for impact.  The proposed Center's overall mission is to provide the public, policy-makers and practitioners with pragmatic, evidence-based knowledge and tools to directly reduce the toll of violence and injury and, in doing so, to also develop a Comprehensive Injury Prevention Center.

"Farm Theater: A Novel Safety Strategy Approach for Agricultural Communities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excessive worker injury rates continue in agriculture. Adult and senior farmers in the Southern U.S. region experience the highest occurrence of agricultural occupational injury and mortality in the nation. In this community-based, translationa intervention effectiveness research study, we will work with established farm community organizations in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi, to develop and test a novel intervention: didactic reader's theater, with 450 adult and senior farmers, and their family members, to positively change farm work culture and safety behavior. A comparison group (n=450) will allow rigorous analysis of the effect of the intervention. In the final year we will pilot test the intervention's effect with younger farmers (n=80), plus a comparison group, (n=80). Together with the farm organizations, we will establish mechanisms to sustain the intervention in farm communities. We expect, given our pilot data, that this intervention will have a substantial impact on decreasing injury risk in the target states and other southern states, with generalizability to multiple rural areas in the United States. This proposal addresses HP 2020 Occupational Safety and Health through the NORA Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing (AgFF) Sector Council's Strategic Goal #2 - Vulnerable workers (subset older farmers), Action step 2.43: ""Facilitate the development and evaluation of high quality and appropriate materials where gaps exist""; Goal #3: ""Move proven health and safety strategies into agricultural, forestry and fishing workplaces through the development of partnerships and collaborative efforts""; Goal #4: ""Reduce the number, rate, and severity of traumatic injuries and deaths involving hazards of production agriculture and support activities"", and Goal #5: ""Improve the health and well-being of agricultural workers by reducing occupational causes or contributing factors to acute and chronic illness and disease"". It also addresses the cross sectors of work organization, health disparities, traumatic injury, and stress-related disorders. The specific aims are to: 1. Develop and deliver, in cooperation with the farm community, a translational intervention, didactic readers  theater, to reduce injury and enhance the health of adult and senior farmers, and their families; 2. Test the efficacy of the agricultural health/safety didactic readers theater in changig farm work behavior of  adult and senior farmers and their families; 3.

"Hired Latino Youth Farmworkers: Work Organization, Safety, Hazards, and Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Agriculture is a unique industry in the United States in the manner in which youth can be involved. Youth as young as 14 years of age can be employed to do farm work without parental consent, and youth as young as 10 years can be employed to do farm work with parental consent. Youth employed in agriculture can work with sharp tools, machinery, and pesticides, as well as do the strenuous tasks of planting, cultivating and harvesting crops, and working with large animals. The rates of injuries and illness among youth agricultural workers are extremely high. The safety and health of hired youth migrant and seasonal farmworkers are seldom considered in analyses of child agricultural injuries. Hired youth farmworkers are part of the larger vulnerable immigrant farmworker community, and include children in seasonal farmworker families, those in migrant families, and unaccompanied youth. Migrant and seasonal farmworkers are a vulnerable population that experiences significant health disparities; the experiences of youth hired Latino farmworkers, which includes harassment and abuse, places them at even greater risk. However, little research has documented the safety and health of youth hired Latino farmworkers. This project is based on a community-based participatory research collaboration between community advocates, youth, and academic investigators. Focused on youth farmworkers aged 10 to 15 years, it will use a mixed-methods approach that combines qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with longitudinal statistical data from detailed interviews, clinical examinations, and biomarkers to address 3 specific aims: (1) describe the common work experiences of hired Latino youth farmworkers, including why and when they work, the tasks they perform, their training and supervision, their working conditions, the benefits and hazards they perceive are associated with work, and how they believe farm work influences their health; (2) delineate (a) the personal and developmental characteristics, work characteristics, work organization, and work safety culture of hired Latino youth farmworkers; (b) the work related occupational, environmental, and social hazards they experience; and (c) their behavioral, psychological, and physical health characteristics; and (3) determine the (a) associations of work characteristics and hazards of hired Latino youth farmworkers with their health characteristics; and (b) how the associations of work characteristics and hazards with health are affected by their work organization, safety culture, and developmental characteristics. This project is significant and innovative because it will provide longitudinal data on the occupational hazards experienced by hired youth farmworkers, and document the work organization and work safety culture in which they work. It examines how agricultural work and hazards affect immediate physical injury, but also how these factors influence the psychological and behavioral health of these children. This information will inform safety process and policy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hired youth farmworkers experience high rates of occupational injury. Data are needed delineate how work organization and safety culture are associated with hazards and health outcomes among these youth workers. This project uses a mixed-methods design and community-based participatory research approach to delineate the characteristics of hired youth farmworkers, their occupational hazards, and their work organization and safety culture characteristics.            ","Hired Latino Youth Farmworkers: Work Organization, Safety, Hazards, and Health",9097277,R01HD084420,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' agricultural ', ' Agriculture ', ' Animals ', ' assault ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Drowning ', ' Employment ', ' Family ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Housing ', ' Industry ', ' Interview ', ' literacy ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Migrant ', ' Nomads ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Pesticides ', ' Plants ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Siblings ', ' Supervision ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Health Hazards ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' self injury ', ' self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' intentional self harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' falls ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Social Network ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Rural ', ' agriculture worker ', ' Agricultural Workers ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' farmworker ', ' farm worker ', ' tool ', ' occupational hazard ', ' Hour ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Occupational ', ' Farm ', ' Farming environment ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' Parental Consent ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' behavioral health ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Fatality rate ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' injured ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' migration ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 10 year old ', ' ten year old ', ' age 10 years ', ' 14 year old ', ' fourteen year old ', ' age 14 years ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' social science research ', ' collaborative environment ', ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' supportive environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' job environment ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interactive environment ', ' informal environment ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' competitive environment ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' Fatal injury ', ' Occupational injury ', ' ']",NICHD,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,655738,0.03663769723628733
"Effectiveness of a safety intervention for dating violence DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intimate partner violence (IPV), including violence in dating relationships (dating violence, DV) is a widespread and serious public health problem. Among U.S. female IPV survivors, 47.1% report their first abusive relationship occurred at college age (age 18-24). Similarly, in national surveys, adults respondents 18-24 years of age report the highest rate of stalking victimization, most commonly by a former intimate partner. Safety planning is the most widely used intervention to prevent and respond to DV/IPV, yet the vast majority of abused women never access safety planning services. Our challenge is to increase college women's access and use of safety planning, with the opportunity to consider their unique safety priorities and level of danger during and when ending an abusive relationship. In addition, while ""bystander"" interventions that train peers to safely intervene hav been shown to be effective in sexual assault prevention on campus, and college women in abusive relationships most frequently disclose DV/IPV to a friend, no similar interventions have been tested with friends for DV/IPV response on campuses. Therefore, the objective of the 5-year study is to evaluate the: 1) effectiveness of an interactive, personalized safety decision application (""App""), called iPlan, intervention in Maryland and Oregon with: 1) college women (age 18-24) who experience DV/IPV and 2) friends (age 18-24) of women experiencing DV/IPV. The iPlan App allows the user to enter information on: a) relationship health; b) safety priorities and c) severity of violence/danger in relationship. The App then uses the information to provide the user with a personalized safety plan with links to campus/local resources; and 2) dissemination of the iPlan App in partnership with the One Love Foundation, a national advocacy organization, in an expanded four states (Arizona, Maryland, Missouri, and Oregon) to determine the reach, adoption, implementation and maintenance of App use among university/college students. Our study will address the paucity of evidence that exists on how to disseminate effective safety interventions to prevent and respond to DV/IPV on large and diverse university/college campuses. Despite the significant evidence of negative health and social outcomes of DV/IPV across the lifespan, and the complex priorities that influence safety for college women and friends, little is known about what interventions are most effective and what dissemination approaches are best suited to prevent and respond to DV/IPV university/college campuses. The findings from the study will begin to address this paucity of evidence and assist in implementation of national DV/IPV safety interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The study addresses National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) priorities to develop and test interventions to reduce disparities and improve the health of women and children through their lifespan.

"Agriculture and Climate Change Impacts on Workers' Health and Safety ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Climate change is here and is predicted to cause dramatic changes in the environment, especially increased episodes of heat, dust and allergens. Very little is being addressed at this time on the effects of climate change on occupational risks of farmers and farm workers. Latino immigrants make up at least 85% of the agricultural work force in California. Without a basic understanding of the nature and magnitude of climate-induced health risks in these vulnerable populations, effective public health interventions cannot be implemented. In addition these groups experience disproportionate rates of occupational injuries and illness within the agricultural sector because of social or psychosocial factors, which lead to increased workplace exposures and susceptibilities. The overall goal of this project is to understand the knowledge level and perceptions of both farm workers and farmers/farm labor contractors concerning climate change so that stakeholders can obtain a better understanding of the factors that will increasingly affect health and safety in the agricultural environment. Our goal is to obtain quantitative and qualitative data on broad community experiences with climate change to improve health outcomes. The research will take place in California's San Joaquin Valley because this is a major agricultural area that already experiences extended periods of high heat and air pollution. The project has three aims. In Specific Aim 1, knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and reported behaviors regarding climate change and its effects on occupational health and safety hazards as a result of poor air quality, extreme heat temperatures and drought will be assessed. Knowledge and perceptions will be examined among a broad base of stakeholders, including farm workers, farmers, and farm labor contractors, using key informant interviews, focus groups and questionnaires. In Specific Aim 2, a coalition of researchers working on climate change and regulators (such as state agencies) will be established and convened to specifically determine possible effects on agriculture, health, disease and safety (e.g., effects on machinery, safety systems) over three years to coordinate information, provide updates and determine likely occupational health and safety effects. Lastly, in Specific Aim 3, findings will initiate translational development of adaptive an educational programs tailored to the agricultural community to increase the awareness of proper practices to reduce the risk climate-change induced safety and health decrements and disease (R2P: Research to Practice). Research effectiveness will be measured through the following outputs: publications, reports, annual community forum proceedings, presentations/posters, investigator career development, tools, guidelines, recommendations and development of educational and training materials. Outcomes measured may include public or private policy changes, trainings or workshops based on project outputs and citations in the literature. The study addresses the following NIOSH/NORA cross sector programs: exposure assessment, occupational health disparities, prevention through design and global collaborations to reduce climate-induced disease in agricultural workers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The study focuses on agriculture and climate change impacts on Latino immigrant farm worker health and safety in the California San Joaquin Valley (one of the most intensely farmed areas in the USA). The goal is to address health impacts due to climate change; heighten awareness of climate change and its effects among farm workers, employers, and labor contractors; and identify research-to-practice solutions to effectively protect immigrant farm workers.            ",Agriculture and Climate Change Impacts on Workers' Health and Safety,8960680,U01OH010969,[''],NIOSH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U01,2016,274999,0.029193353110953

"UAW Hazardous Material Worker Health and Safety Training (U45) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The International Union, UAW proposes to train 2339 workers in the first year, providing 22,545 contact hours of training using 25 different curricula t worksites and at union-sponsored functions. The UAW will train 11,695 participants and provide 112,725 contact hours of training over the life of the project. We will expand the scope of an on-going program which provides training in hazardous waste operations, hazardous materials transportation, environmental restoration of contaminated site, emergency response and related health and safety topics. The long-term objective of this project is to prevent work-related harm by providing health and safety training to UAW members and members of communities disadvantaged by environmental injustice, limited English proficiency and/or lack of educational opportunity. The training will help them to protect themselves, their places of employment and their communities from exposure to hazardous materials. A special strength of this project is that it integrates the technical expertise of the UAW and the University of Michigan (U-M) in basic disciplines of health and safety, the practical experience of the UAW in addressing hazards at work, and the ongoing relationship of the UAW with trainees and management at worksites served. We plan to enhance collaboration with groups that serve populations with limited English proficiency, occupational health disparities and environmental justice challenges. To do so, we propose not just to deliver health and safety training to community members recruited by our partner organizations, but also to transfer health and safety training skills to te staffs of our partner organizations through train-the-trainer programs. Our partner organizations include:  - Catholic Charities Hispanic Outreach Services  - United Hispanic Workers of Detroit  - Macomb International Services Center  - Detroiters Working for Environmental Justice  - Green Door Initiative  - OAI Inc  The paramount goal of this project is to prevent work-related harm by training UAW members and others in how best to protect themselves and their communities from exposure to hazardous materials encountered during hazardous waste operations, hazardous materials transportation, environmental restoration of contaminated facilities and/or chemical emergency response. The specific aims are to:  1. Conduct training in health and safety topics directly or indirectly related to elimination and/or reduction of potential exposure o hazardous materials.  2. Develop new curricula on chemical safety and security, climate change, Ebola and other topics. Revise and expand existing curricula as needed. Integrate advanced training technology into new and revised curricula to improve the delivery of training (WETP Mission Priority 5).  3. Continue and intensify efforts to identify and target high-risk worksites for delivery of training.  4. Continue and expand collaborative partnerships with community groups and other NIEHS-WETP grantees. These partnerships will be particularly focused on addressing underserved workers, health disparities and environmental justice.  5. Conduct program evaluation, integrating use of worker-evaluators to provide feedback for continual improvement of curricula and delivery methods. This will include evaluating the long-term impact of IER training on worker and organizational outcomes.  6. Continue and expand a study that identifies factors contributing to suboptimal safety cultures and assesses the effectiveness of low cost intervention strategies to positively change suboptimal workplace safety cultures.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The International Union, UAW proposes to expand the scope of an on-going program whose long-term objective is to prevent the adverse consequences of exposure to hazardous materials by providing health and safety training to UAW members and members of communities disadvantaged by environmental injustice, limited English proficiency and/or lack of educational opportunity. We propose not just to deliver health and safety training to community members recruited by our partner organizations, but also to transfer health and safety training skills to the staffs of our partner organizations through train-the-trainer program. Our membership is national in scope and we have a track record of more than thirty years of competence and experience in delivering this kind of training. The major problem we address is the potential for illness and injury associated with contact with hazardous materials.

"Effectiveness of a safety intervention for dating violence DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intimate partner violence (IPV), including violence in dating relationships (dating violence, DV) is a widespread and serious public health problem. Among U.S. female IPV survivors, 47.1% report their first abusive relationship occurred at college age (age 18-24). Similarly, in national surveys, adults respondents 18-24 years of age report the highest rate of stalking victimization, most commonly by a former intimate partner. Safety planning is the most widely used intervention to prevent and respond to DV/IPV, yet the vast majority of abused women never access safety planning services. Our challenge is to increase college women's access and use of safety planning, with the opportunity to consider their unique safety priorities and level of danger during and when ending an abusive relationship. In addition, while ""bystander"" interventions that train peers to safely intervene hav been shown to be effective in sexual assault prevention on campus, and college women in abusive relationships most frequently disclose DV/IPV to a friend, no similar interventions have been tested with friends for DV/IPV response on campuses. Therefore, the objective of the 5-year study is to evaluate the: 1) effectiveness of an interactive, personalized safety decision application (""App""), called iPlan, intervention in Maryland and Oregon with: 1) college women (age 18-24) who experience DV/IPV and 2) friends (age 18-24) of women experiencing DV/IPV. The iPlan App allows the user to enter information on: a) relationship health; b) safety priorities and c) severity of violence/danger in relationship. The App then uses the information to provide the user with a personalized safety plan with links to campus/local resources; and 2) dissemination of the iPlan App in partnership with the One Love Foundation, a national advocacy organization, in an expanded four states (Arizona, Maryland, Missouri, and Oregon) to determine the reach, adoption, implementation and maintenance of App use among university/college students. Our study will address the paucity of evidence that exists on how to disseminate effective safety interventions to prevent and respond to DV/IPV on large and diverse university/college campuses. Despite the significant evidence of negative health and social outcomes of DV/IPV across the lifespan, and the complex priorities that influence safety for college women and friends, little is known about what interventions are most effective and what dissemination approaches are best suited to prevent and respond to DV/IPV university/college campuses. The findings from the study will begin to address this paucity of evidence and assist in implementation of national DV/IPV safety interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The study addresses National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) priorities to develop and test interventions to reduce disparities and improve the health of women and children through their lifespan. Research findings will inform the science for large-scale implementation of a technology advanced DV/IPV safety interventions for a high risk population, university/college students in a high risk setting, university/college campuses.",Effectiveness of a safety intervention for dating violence,9258456,R01HD076881,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Age Reporting ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Arizona ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Control Groups ', ' Faculty ', ' Female ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Maryland ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Missouri ', ' Names ', ' Oregon ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Woman ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' prevent violence ', ' violence prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' sexual attack ', ' assaulted sexually ', ' sexual assault ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' abuse of women ', ' abuse of females ', ' Abused women ', ' Abused females ', ' Battered Women ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Respondent ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' university student ', ' college student ', ' peer ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Age-Years ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' dating violence ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' Outcome ', ' relationship abuse ', ' abusive relationship ', ' advocacy organizations ', ' high risk ', ' loved ones ', ' public health relevance ', ' social media ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,592161,0.09200265854780769
"Farm Theater: A Novel Safety Strategy Approach for Agricultural Communities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excessive worker injury rates continue in agriculture. Adult and senior farmers in the Southern U.S. region experience the highest occurrence of agricultural occupational injury and mortality in the nation. In this community-based, translationa intervention effectiveness research study, we will work with established farm community organizations in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi, to develop and test a novel intervention: didactic reader's theater, with 450 adult and senior farmers, and their family members, to positively change farm work culture and safety behavior. A comparison group (n=450) will allow rigorous analysis of the effect of the intervention. In the final year we will pilot test the intervention's effect with younger farmers (n=80), plus a comparison group, (n=80). Together with the farm organizations, we will establish mechanisms to sustain the intervention in farm communities. We expect, given our pilot data, that this intervention will have a substantial impact on decreasing injury risk in the target states and other southern states, with generalizability to multiple rural areas in the United States. This proposal addresses HP 2020 Occupational Safety and Health through the NORA Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing (AgFF) Sector Council's Strategic Goal #2 - Vulnerable workers (subset older farmers), Action step 2.43: ""Facilitate the development and evaluation of high quality and appropriate materials where gaps exist""; Goal #3: ""Move proven health and safety strategies into agricultural, forestry and fishing workplaces through the development of partnerships and collaborative efforts""; Goal #4: ""Reduce the number, rate, and severity of traumatic injuries and deaths involving hazards of production agriculture and support activities"", and Goal #5: ""Improve the health and well-being of agricultural workers by reducing occupational causes or contributing factors to acute and chronic illness and disease"". It also addresses the cross sectors of work organization, health disparities, traumatic injury, and stress-related disorders. The specific aims are to: 1. Develop and deliver, in cooperation with the farm community, a translational intervention, didactic readers  theater, to reduce injury and enhance the health of adult and senior farmers, and their families; 2. Test the efficacy of the agricultural health/safety didactic readers theater in changig farm work behavior of  adult and senior farmers and their families; 3. Strengthen the local capacity of agricultural communities and organizations to develop and deliver effective  health and safety interventions through theater and other approaches, over time (sustainability). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Agriculture has excessive worker injury rates. Senior farmers and adult farmers in the South experience some of the highest occupational injury and mortality in the nation.

"Investigating Failures of Notification and Monitoring in Outpatient Care: the Safety Promotion Action Research and Knowledge (SPARK) Network ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ensuring patient safety remains a critical issue for health care systems. In particular, ambulatory (outpatient) health care settings are vulnerable to patient safety concerns. The majority of health care is delivered in ambulatory settings, with 1.2 billion outpatient visits annually in the United States (U.S.). Between failures of monitoring, and missed and delayed diagnosis, there is significant morbidity and mortality from patient safety problems in outpatient care. Although strides have been made in recognizing and preventing adverse events, little is known about the epidemiology of patient safety in ambulatory care settings and factors that contribute to these disparities. The overall goals of this proposal are t examine the epidemiology of patient safety in ambulatory care settings that care for diverse, low-income populations as follows; (1) to characterize the incidence and prevalence of specific safety gaps, by race/ ethnicity and language proficiency; (2) to gather in- depth, qualitative evidence about strategies that can improve safety and characterize disparities in patient safety; (3) to pilot-test patient safety monitoring methodologies in a diverse sample of five safety net health care systems; and (4) to develop a measurement and error investigation toolkit for dissemination amongst safety-net health care systems. Specifically, we will identify the extent of missed notification for actionable test results and extent of missed monitoring for high-risk populations. These two process gaps, periodic monitoring of high-risk conditions and notification of actionable abnormal test results, both lead to preventable patient harm. While these care gaps are documented, the extent of disparities in harm and the populations at highest risk remain unclear. To further deepen this knowledge, we will elucidate underlying causes for these safety gaps, focusing on disparities we identify in the data. Finally, we aim to give safety-net health systems participating in this study the methodological tools to conduct measurement of these safety gaps and perform event investigation, in order to set the stage for future improvement and innovation work to close gaps in disparities. We propose a collaborative Safety Promotion Action Research and Knowledge Network (SPARK Network) to achieve the following specific aims: 1) to develop feasible, timely, and accurate electronic measures of patient safety notification and monitoring gaps in an ambulatory care setting for high-risk sub- populations and characterize the extent of disparities in patient safety; 2) to conduct a root cause analysis of patient safety notification/ monitoring gaps in five public ambulatory care settings to identify factors contributing to these disparities; and 3) to evaluate the pilot implementation of patient safety monitoring methodologies developed from Aims 1 and 2 across five diverse ambulatory health care settings. We envision that pilot findings from this project wil result in a measurement and root cause analysis toolkit of patient safety monitoring methodologies that can be widely disseminated across health care systems that care for diverse populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term goal of this research is to reduce adverse events and errors in outpatient health care. This project is focused on approaches to measure and characterize adverse events in result notification and ongoing monitoring for high risk health conditions in safety net health care systems that care for diverse patient populations, including low-income and race/ ethnic minority groups. We aim to measure the extent of disparities in patient safety in ambulatory care settings and ways to understand underlying reasons for these disparities.",Investigating Failures of Notification and Monitoring in Outpatient Care: the Safety Promotion Action Research and Knowledge (SPARK) Network,9322414,R01HS024426,[''],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2017,481978,0.093501868934983
"Hired Latino Youth Farmworkers: Work Organization, Safety, Hazards, and Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Agriculture is a unique industry in the United States in the manner in which youth can be involved. Youth as young as 14 years of age can be employed to do farm work without parental consent, and youth as young as 10 years can be employed to do farm work with parental consent. Youth employed in agriculture can work with sharp tools, machinery, and pesticides, as well as do the strenuous tasks of planting, cultivating and harvesting crops, and working with large animals. The rates of injuries and illness among youth agricultural workers are extremely high. The safety and health of hired youth migrant and seasonal farmworkers are seldom considered in analyses of child agricultural injuries. Hired youth farmworkers are part of the larger vulnerable immigrant farmworker community, and include children in seasonal farmworker families, those in migrant families, and unaccompanied youth. Migrant and seasonal farmworkers are a vulnerable population that experiences significant health disparities; the experiences of youth hired Latino farmworkers, which includes harassment and abuse, places them at even greater risk. However, little research has documented the safety and health of youth hired Latino farmworkers. This project is based on a community-based participatory research collaboration between community advocates, youth, and academic investigators. Focused on youth farmworkers aged 10 to 15 years, it will use a mixed-methods approach that combines qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with longitudinal statistical data from detailed interviews, clinical examinations, and biomarkers to address 3 specific aims: (1) describe the common work experiences of hired Latino youth farmworkers, including why and when they work, the tasks they perform, their training and supervision, their working conditions, the benefits and hazards they perceive are associated with work, and how they believe farm work influences their health; (2) delineate (a) the personal and developmental characteristics, work characteristics, work organization, and work safety culture of hired Latino youth farmworkers; (b) the work related occupational, environmental, and social hazards they experience; and (c) their behavioral, psychological, and physical health characteristics; and (3) determine the (a) associations of work characteristics and hazards of hired Latino youth farmworkers with their health characteristics; and (b) how the associations of work characteristics and hazards with health are affected by their work organization, safety culture, and developmental characteristics. This project is significant and innovative because it will provide longitudinal data on the occupational hazards experienced by hired youth farmworkers, and document the work organization and work safety culture in which they work. It examines how agricultural work and hazards affect immediate physical injury, but also how these factors influence the psychological and behavioral health of these children. This information will inform safety process and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hired youth farmworkers experience high rates of occupational injury. Data are needed delineate how work organization and safety culture are associated with hazards and health outcomes among these youth workers. This project uses a mixed-methods design and community-based participatory research approach to delineate the characteristics of hired youth farmworkers, their occupational hazards, and their work organization and safety culture characteristics.","Hired Latino Youth Farmworkers: Work Organization, Safety, Hazards, and Health",9259805,R01HD084420,"['Affect ', ' agricultural ', ' Agriculture ', ' Animals ', ' assault ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Communities ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Drowning ', ' Employment ', ' Family ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Housing ', ' Industry ', ' Interview ', ' literacy ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Nomads ', ' Migrant ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Pesticides ', ' Plants ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Siblings ', ' Supervision ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' self injury ', ' self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' intentional self harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' falls ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Social Network ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Rural ', ' agriculture worker ', ' Agricultural Workers ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' farm worker ', ' farmworker ', ' tool ', ' occupational hazard ', ' Hour ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Occupational ', ' Farming environment ', ' Farm ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' Parental Consent ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' behavioral health ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Fatality rate ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' injured ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' migration ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 10 year old ', ' ten years of age ', ' ten year old ', ' age 10 years ', ' 10 years of age ', ' 14 year old ', ' fourteen years of age ', ' fourteen year old ', ' age 14 years ', ' 14 years of age ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' collaborative environment ', ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' supportive environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' job environment ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interactive environment ', ' informal environment ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' competitive environment ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' Fatal injury ', ' Occupational injury ', ' ']",NICHD,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,610838,0.03663769723628733
"Development of a Risk Factor Screen for Mental Health Problems after Sudden Illness or Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be debilitating and is related to impaired occupational and social functioning, chronic medical problems, disability, and increases in suicidality, violence, and criminal behavior. Over 10 million Americans are treated annually for sudden, severe illnesses or injuries that require very urgent treatment; and an estimated 20% of hospitalized traumatic injury patients have persisting mental health problems. Identifying those at risk for later disorder is difficult, and no screens can accurately predict PTSD in Americans exposed to traumatic stress. In research on adults exposed to traumatic injury, theory-driven pre- trauma, time-of-trauma, and post-trauma risk factors were strongly related to outcomes and accurately identified those who later had elevated PTSD symptoms. We propose to extend our work to a population level to create a screen for use in U.S. hospitals. In diverse populations of sudden illness or injury patients at hospitals sites in Baltimore, MD, Akron, OH, and Palo Alto, CA, data will be collected on theory-driven, highly predictive pre-trauma (gender, education, socioeconomic status, ethnicity/race, childhood home life and parental dysfunction, past trauma exposure); time-of-trauma (trauma intensity, pre-trauma home life; pre- trauma life stress), and post-trauma (acute PTSD and dissociation symptoms, negative thinking; post-trauma life stress; post-trauma social support; post-trauma social constraints) risk factors and later symptoms of disorder in 1,500 patients, including 1,100 (76%) ethnic/racial minorities. Data will also be collected on five variables found to relate to disparities in mental health or PTSD: discrimination/racism, competing needs, community cohesion, stigma, and negative expectations about treatment. Data collected will include sufficiently large samples of African American, Latino, Asians, and mixed ethnicity/race patients for separately analyses for these groups. Relationships of all predictors and disparities variables to outcomes and covariance among predictors and disparities variables will be examined to select risk factor and disparities variables that are highly predictive, similarly related to outcomes across subgroups, and can be measured with the fewest items and items that are briefer and less personal, stigmatizing, and difficult to understand. In Wave II of data collection, predictive performance will be assessed in a new sample of 1,500 patients, including 1,100 (76%) ethnic/racial minorities with a goal of identifying at least 80% (sensitivity) of those who later have high PTSD symptoms and at least 70% (specificity) of those who recover well. Project Narrative This project aims to develop and validate a practical and highly accurate screen to identify those at high risk for mental health problems following sudden serious illnesses or injuries and to insure that the screen performs well for those in ethnic/racial minority groups. Availability of an accurate screen will allow preventive care for those at high risk and could spur treatment development by allowing easy identification of those who could enroll in preventive and early intervention studies. Findings relating to disparities in risk factors and variables that influence responses to trauma differently for ethnic/racial minorities could be used to develop treatments targeted to these subgroups to reduce disparities in the emergence and severity of psychopathology and in mental health care after trauma exposure.",Development of a Risk Factor Screen for Mental Health Problems after Sudden Illness or Injury,9425651,R01MD012273,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Baltimore ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Sudden Death ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Natural Disasters ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Terrorism ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Dissociation ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' criminal behavior ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Occupational ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohesion ', ' expectation ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Early intervention trials ', ' Social Functioning ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' rural disparities ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Life Stress ', ' Trauma ', ' Impairment ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' loved ones ', ' public health emergency ', ' screening ', ' Trauma patient ', ' traumatic event ', ' Traumatic injury ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' acute symptom ', ' rurality ', ' rural counties ', ' ']",NIMHD,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2017,693637,0.07265717981887085
"ASPIRE: Advancing Safety Process Innovation in Rheumatology ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite widespread recognition of pervasive patient safety problems in the U.S. health care system, research to develop feasible, scalable solutions has lagged, particularly in the ambulatory setting. The need for new approaches to improve safety is especially pressing in the care of ambulatory patients using high-risk immunosuppressive medications, as reports of preventable adverse events among this category of drugs have increased. To date, no studies have carefully defined the epidemiology of these safety risks. The proposed Advancing Safety Process Innovation Using Registries (ASPIRE) project will use advanced electronic health record (EHR) data analytics to define the magnitude of ambulatory patient safety errors and adverse events for patients receiving high risk medications (Aim 1). We will also characterize disparities in these risks across race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and medical complexity. Three categories of patient safety processes will be examined: 1) preventive practices that reduce adverse medication events, 2) safety monitoring for patients using high-risk immunosuppressive medications, and 3) management of abnormal results from medication toxicity monitoring. These findings will be used to inform the development of eMeasures, a new approach to quality measurement that uses automatically extracted EHR information to give clinicians and health systems information regarding specific patient safety problems (Aim 2). We will use eMeasurement standards, including the Quality Data Model (QDM), Health Quality Measures Format (HQMF) and other structured coded terminologies to develop, specify and test system-wide prototype eMeasures. HIT-solutions such as eMeasures that can be applied across EHR data repositories serve as a foundation for a continuous learning health care system, as envisioned by the Institute of Medicine. The work proposed here builds the groundwork for further testing and nationwide dissemination of eMeasures to monitor and improve safety for those using high-risk medications in the ambulatory setting.

"Building Research Capacity for Firearm Safety Among Children Among U.S. children, firearm-related fatalities are the 2nd leading cause of death and include the unintentional, accidental discharge of a firearm by a toddler with a playmate, the use of a firearm to self-inflict harm by a suicidal teen, and the escalation of bullying or dating violence to lethal means by an adolescent. Substantial disparities exist in firearm-related injuries, with African-American children disproportionally impacted by unintentional and assaultive firearm injury, and rural youth disproportionately dying of suicide by firearm. Childhood firearm injury rates have remained unchanged in the recent decades despite significant reductions in non-firearm fatal injuries due to an approach that includes improved epidemiologic data, behavior modifications, and technological solutions. In contrast, research funding and publications for firearm injury have lagged, leading to a current deficit of both established and developing researchers, as well as a lack of pilot work and literature needed to support large scale studies. A 2013 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report detailed the urgent need for novel and innovative research to address this deficit, however, was primarily focused on adult populations. This proposal builds on these IOM recommendations and utilizes multidisciplinary research expertise across the U.S., as well as stakeholder partner groups of gun owners, to catalyze the science of childhood firearm injury prevention with the overarching goal of reducing firearm injuries among children while also respecting gun ownership as an important part of the cultural fabric of US society. Our specific aims are: Aim #1: Create a multidisciplinary team of researchers and stakeholder partners to define a pediatric-specific firearm injury research agenda for the five workgroups; Aim #2: Stimulate novel firearm prevention research by having workgroups conduct pilot studies that address key research questions identified in Aim 1, to provide preliminary data that informs large-scale studies; Aim #3: Improve access to and use of national firearm data and ease future secondary analyses by: 1) Establishing a web-based searchable data archive for childhood firearm injury that is enabled with variable-level searching and cross-study comparisons; and, 2) Enhancing and improving pediatric firearm injury data collection in existing pediatric datasets such as the PECARN core data project and the PECARN registry database; Aim #4: Build a cadre of national research scholars with multidisciplinary training and expertise that will serve as an emerging pipeline for future research. Expected outcomes of this five-year grant will be to create six research resources: 1) consensus documents detailing the state of the science and key research questions for pediatric firearm injury prevention; 2) pilot data to support five large-scale research proposals; 3) a web-based data archive and searchable research repository on childhood firearm injury; 4) enhanced data collection opportunities on childhood firearm injuries through existing national networks (e.g., PECARN); 5) a cadre of new researchers (postdoctoral students) focused in this research area; and 6) a webinar series to inform researchers nationally in this topic area. PROJECT NARRATIVE Among U.S. children, firearm-related fatalities are the 2nd leading cause of death. Our proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of researchers and community stakeholder groups (gun advocates, gun safety trainers, veterans, family groups) across the U.S. to inform and catalyze the science of childhood firearm injury prevention by addressing both the gaps in research and human resources. The overarching goal of the project is to reduce the number of firearm injuries occurring among children. Our approach seeks to apply the science of injury prevention used in other injury fields such as motor vehicle crash to the field of childhood firearm injuries; it does not seek to limit or reduce the number of firearms owned legally by U.S. adults.",Building Research Capacity for Firearm Safety Among Children,9279711,R24HD087149,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' assault ', ' Attention ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Cause of Death ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Firearms ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Guns ', ' Incidence ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Ownership ', ' Peer Review ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Politics ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rights ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' Standardization ', ' Students ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Textiles ', ' fabric ', ' Translations ', ' Veterans ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' injury prevention ', ' Injury ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Rural ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Consensus ', ' bullying ', ' bully ', ' suicidal ', ' Pattern ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' American ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Toddler ', ' Prevention ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' repository ', ' Legal ', ' motor vehicle injury ', ' injury from motor vehicle accident ', ' injury from car accident ', ' injury due to car accident ', ' car injury ', ' car accident injury ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Training ', ' teenage ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' ER care ', ' ED care ', ' Emergency Care ', ' dating violence ', ' pediatric injury ', ' injury in children ', ' child injury ', ' Childhood Injury ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' knowledge translation ', ' evidence base ', ' surveillance data ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' webinar ', ' Gun injury ', ' firearm injury ', ' Fatal injury ', ' data archive ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R24,2017,1051917,0.25197779847135177
"Disparities in Disability after Traumatic Brain Injury for Hispanic Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability for children in the U.S. Disability after TBI is higher among children with no or government insurance, poor family functioning and lower levels of parental education. In a preliminary study, we documented disparities in long term disability after TBI for Hispanic children; Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) children experience significantly larger reductions in health related quality of life, participation in activities, and ability to communicate and care for themselves 3 years after injury. It is unclear if use of rehabilitation services and/or cultural and language barriers contributed to the documented differences. We propose a three-phase research plan to compare patterns and determinants of utilization of rehabilitation services and its association with disability outcomes between Hispanic, NHW and non-Hispanic Black (NHB) children. We will also develop and pilot-test the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally tailored intervention to reduce barriers for use of rehabilitation services by Hispanic children with TBI. The long term goal of this K23 award is for the candidate to develop as an independent researcher in the area of patient outcomes in vulnerable populations and pediatric trauma disparities research. The K23 candidate is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at the University of Washington. The candidate proposes a five-year training plan with the support of faculty mentors who have expertise in injury outcomes research, community based participatory research, qualitative methods, and intervention trials in minority communities. The University of Washington, Seattle Children's Hospital, and Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center provide excellent institutional support and resources for this award. The research involves three studies. Study 1 will compare use of inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services between Hispanic, NHB and NHW pediatric patients with TBI, and its association with disability. Study 2 will compare predisposing enabling and need factors for use of outpatient rehabilitation services between the three ethnic groups. Study 3 will develop and pilot-test a culturally tailored intervention to reduce barriers fr use of rehabilitation services by Hispanic children with TBI. These studies will expand our understanding of the potential reasons for disparities in the provision of care for children with TBI. It will clarify the role of Hispanic ethnicity in the receipt of rehabilitation care and highe risk of disability after TBI, independent of socioeconomic and minority status. It will lay the groundwork for a multicenter study to evaluate a culturally tailored intervention to reduce barriers for use of rehabilitation services by Hispanic families, which can also serve as a model for other vulnerable populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Significant disparities in long term disability after traumatic brain injury (TBI) exist for Hispanic children. Identifying patterns and determinants for use of rehabilitation services after TBI will reveal risk factors that can allow intervention strategies t be targeted more effectively to Hispanic Children and other vulnerable populations.

"Agriculture and Climate Change Impacts on Workers' Health and Safety ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Climate change is here and is predicted to cause dramatic changes in the environment, especially increased episodes of heat, dust and allergens. Very little is being addressed at this time on the effects of climate change on occupational risks of farmers and farm workers. Latino immigrants make up at least 85% of the agricultural work force in California. Without a basic understanding of the nature and magnitude of climate-induced health risks in these vulnerable populations, effective public health interventions cannot be implemented. In addition these groups experience disproportionate rates of occupational injuries and illness within the agricultural sector because of social or psychosocial factors, which lead to increased workplace exposures and susceptibilities. The overall goal of this project is to understand the knowledge level and perceptions of both farm workers and farmers/farm labor contractors concerning climate change so that stakeholders can obtain a better understanding of the factors that will increasingly affect health and safety in the agricultural environment. Our goal is to obtain quantitative and qualitative data on broad community experiences with climate change to improve health outcomes. The research will take place in California's San Joaquin Valley because this is a major agricultural area that already experiences extended periods of high heat and air pollution. The project has three aims. In Specific Aim 1, knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and reported behaviors regarding climate change and its effects on occupational health and safety hazards as a result of poor air quality, extreme heat temperatures and drought will be assessed. Knowledge and perceptions will be examined among a broad base of stakeholders, including farm workers, farmers, and farm labor contractors, using key informant interviews, focus groups and questionnaires. In Specific Aim 2, a coalition of researchers working on climate change and regulators (such as state agencies) will be established and convened to specifically determine possible effects on agriculture, health, disease and safety (e.g., effects on machinery, safety systems) over three years to coordinate information, provide updates and determine likely occupational health and safety effects. Lastly, in Specific Aim 3, findings will initiate translational development of adaptive an educational programs tailored to the agricultural community to increase the awareness of proper practices to reduce the risk climate-change induced safety and health decrements and disease (R2P: Research to Practice). Research effectiveness will be measured through the following outputs: publications, reports, annual community forum proceedings, presentations/posters, investigator career development, tools, guidelines, recommendations and development of educational and training materials. Outcomes measured may include public or private policy changes, trainings or workshops based on project outputs and citations in the literature. The study addresses the following NIOSH/NORA cross sector programs: exposure assessment, occupational health disparities, prevention through design and global collaborations to reduce climate-induced disease in agricultural workers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The study focuses on agriculture and climate change impacts on Latino immigrant farm worker health and safety in the California San Joaquin Valley (one of the most intensely farmed areas in the USA). The goal is to address health impacts due to climate change; heighten awareness of climate change and its effects among farm workers, employers, and labor contractors; and identify research-to-practice solutions to effectively protect immigrant farm workers.",Agriculture and Climate Change Impacts on Workers' Health and Safety,9341203,U01OH010969,[''],NIOSH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U01,2017,274999,0.029193353110953
"Development of a Risk Factor Screen for Mental Health Problems after Sudden Illness or Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be debilitating and is related to impaired occupational and social functioning, chronic medical problems, disability, and increases in suicidality, violence, and criminal behavior. Over 10 million Americans are treated annually for sudden, severe illnesses or injuries that require very urgent treatment; and an estimated 20% of hospitalized traumatic injury patients have persisting mental health problems. Identifying those at risk for later disorder is difficult, and no screens can accurately predict PTSD in Americans exposed to traumatic stress. In research on adults exposed to traumatic injury, theory-driven pre- trauma, time-of-trauma, and post-trauma risk factors were strongly related to outcomes and accurately identified those who later had elevated PTSD symptoms. We propose to extend our work to a population level to create a screen for use in U.S. hospitals. In diverse populations of sudden illness or injury patients at hospitals sites in Baltimore, MD, Akron, OH, and Palo Alto, CA, data will be collected on theory-driven, highly predictive pre-trauma (gender, education, socioeconomic status, ethnicity/race, childhood home life and parental dysfunction, past trauma exposure); time-of-trauma (trauma intensity, pre-trauma home life; pre- trauma life stress), and post-trauma (acute PTSD and dissociation symptoms, negative thinking; post-trauma life stress; post-trauma social support; post-trauma social constraints) risk factors and later symptoms of disorder in 1,500 patients, including 1,100 (76%) ethnic/racial minorities. Data will also be collected on five variables found to relate to disparities in mental health or PTSD: discrimination/racism, competing needs, community cohesion, stigma, and negative expectations about treatment. Data collected will include sufficiently large samples of African American, Latino, Asians, and mixed ethnicity/race patients for separately analyses for these groups. Relationships of all predictors and disparities variables to outcomes and covariance among predictors and disparities variables will be examined to select risk factor and disparities variables that are highly predictive, similarly related to outcomes across subgroups, and can be measured with the fewest items and items that are briefer and less personal, stigmatizing, and difficult to understand. In Wave II of data collection, predictive performance will be assessed in a new sample of 1,500 patients, including 1,100 (76%) ethnic/racial minorities with a goal of identifying at least 80% (sensitivity) of those who later have high PTSD symptoms and at least 70% (specificity) of those who recover well. Project Narrative This project aims to develop and validate a practical and highly accurate screen to identify those at high risk for mental health problems following sudden serious illnesses or injuries and to insure that the screen performs well for those in ethnic/racial minority groups. Availability of an accurate screen will allow preventive care for those at high risk and could spur treatment development by allowing easy identification of those who could enroll in preventive and early intervention studies. Findings relating to disparities in risk factors and variables that influence responses to trauma differently for ethnic/racial minorities could be used to develop treatments targeted to these subgroups to reduce disparities in the emergence and severity of psychopathology and in mental health care after trauma exposure.",Development of a Risk Factor Screen for Mental Health Problems after Sudden Illness or Injury,9568397,R01MD012273,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Baltimore ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Sudden Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Natural Disasters ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Terrorism ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Work ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Dissociation ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' criminal behavior ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Occupational ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohesion ', ' expectation ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Early intervention trials ', ' Social Functioning ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' rural disparities ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Life Stress ', ' Trauma ', ' Impairment ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' loved ones ', ' public health emergency ', ' screening ', ' Trauma patient ', ' traumatic event ', ' Traumatic injury ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' acute symptom ', ' rurality ', ' rural counties ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' trauma exposure ', ' ']",NIMHD,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2018,626313,0.07265717981887085
"Implementation of a Safety Program in Guatemala ABSTRACT ‐ ‐ Medical and surgical care is fraught with hazards, particularly in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Powerful institutional wide processes to improve health safety have come from high reliability organizations (HROs) which have advocated adoption of a “culture of safety,” which is the shared values, attitudes, perceptions, and patterns of behavior that determine the effort with which staff direct their attention towards minimizing patient harm. Measures of staff perceptions about safety culture–termed the “safety climate”– are critical to develop quality improvement efforts. Our overall goal‐is to improve surgical safety for children by building a safety culture in resource constrained settings. Following measurement of the safety climate at two ‐ pediatric units in two public hospitals in Guatemala using a low cost, standardized, electronic survey tool, we will assess the implementation of the SCORE safety program at these two units. Our research team is a public private partnership (PPP) composed of Guatemalan hospital leadership, U.S. academic experts, and social entrepreneurs from a private U.S. patient safety organization.

"VALES+Tú: Targeting psychosocial stressors to reduce Latino Day Laborers injury disparities VALES+Tú: Targeting Psychosocial Stressors to Reduce Latino Day Laborers Injury Disparities Even as the safety of US workers continues to improve overall, the safety of Latino workers, especially day laborers, continues to deteriorate. Latino day laborers (LDL) are predominantly Spanish monolingual immigrant workers who experience multiple psychosocial stressors, including situational and immigration stress that amplify their risk for injury at work. LDL look for work at informal hiring sites or “corners” where they get hired intermittently to do a variety of entry-level jobs whose shifting conditions expose them to multiple safety hazards. The most alarming consequence of this constant rotation across unpredictable, dangerous jobs is the high rate of job-related fatalities in this population. Despite the urgent need, there are no effective and rigorously tested safety programs, portable to the corner where LDL wait for work, to help them cope with stressors that increase their risk for workplace injury. Our project's main goal is to address this question: Can a corner-based safety program addressing the psycho social stressors confronted by LDL reduce their reported exposure to hazardous conditions at work? Our proposed project, VALES+Tú (You are worth/worthy of more) is a 5 year community-based participatory program developed in partnership with Latino day laborers whose pilot results provide evidence of increasing risk reduction practices and reducing hazardous exposures at work. We are proposing to implement a multilevel intervention delivered in Spanish by LDL promotores to their peers at the corners and to test the program's effectiveness in a cluster randomized trial. The central aims of the project are: (1) to determine the efficacy of VALES+Tú in reducing hazardous exposures at work, and (2) to determine the mediating effect of psychosocial stressors on the primary outcomes of VALES+Tú. All project activities will be done in collaboration with our community partner, the Fe y Justicia (Faith and Justice) Worker Center, and with guidance from our Community Advisory Board . The short-term goal of VALES+Tú is to reduce LDL workplace hazards by involving them in a corner-based safety program that effectively addresses seldom targeted situational and immigration stress that increase risky practices at work. Our long-term goal is to reduce the high injury rates among Latino day laborers. Mitigating safety risks among LDL is an urgent public health priority that can be addressed by taking effective, low-cost, preventive action. The purpose of the Vales+Tú study is to implement and evaluate an injury prevention program among Latino day laborers (LDL) in Houston who are at a high risk of experiencing an injury at work. Our main objective is to answer this question: Can a corner-based safety program addressing the psychosocial stressors confronted by LDL reduce their exposure to hazardous conditions at work? In partnership with our Community Advisory Board, we will answer this question by testing the efficacy of the program in a group randomized trial to be conducted at local day labor corners. Our short term goal is to determine if we can reduce hazardous work exposures and our long term goal is to reduce LDL injuries at work.

"EMRSHN: Exploring the modulatory role of sex hormones along the neuromechanical axis in females The rate of musculoskeletal injury differs substantially between men and women, with the incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries up to 9 times higher in female athletes. These injuries cause short- and long- term health problems, including time lost from school or work, psychological distress, and post-injury joint osteoarthritis. Sex hormones may make a significant contribution to this injury disparity: injury rate differences are not evident until puberty, and injuries occur disproportionately in the first half of the menstrual cycle. While most research has focused on passive components of the musculoskeletal system, arguing that female fluctuating hormone concentrations may change mechanical properties of the ligament itself, a direct link between ligament laxity and ACL injury has not been proven. The goal of this proposal is to test our central hypothesis that changes in sex hormone concentration result in changes to the basic elements of motor control – at multiple levels, from the musculotendinous unit to motor control circuitry. In our preliminary data, at the muscle level, we have shown that the muscle reflex response is lowest when estradiol concentrations are highest, with no change in anterior knee laxity. At the spinal circuitry level, we have shown that while day-to-day changes in hormone concentration do not modulate spinal motor neuronal excitability, a lower overall level of excitability exists in women who take oral contraceptives. Finally, at the level of the brain, we have shown the excitability of intra-cortical interneuronal circuits is increased when estradiol concentrations are highest. In Aims 1 & 2 of our proposal, daily testing will allow, as never-before, a detailed assessment of the time-specific relationship between hormone concentration and changes at the muscle and spinal level during both relaxed and active states. In Aim 3, daily hormone concentrations will specifically determine each subject's testing day, guiding targeted assessments into the role of fluctuating hormone concentrations on cortical excitability. In Aim 1 we will determine the influence of sex hormone fluctuations on the muscle stretch reflex during active and passive states, and the time-lag between hormone concentration changes and the reflex response. We will use a technically simple assessment that could be implemented in the field. In Aim 2 we will determine the influence of sex hormone fluctuations on spinal motor neuron excitability using H-reflex as a probe and the simultaneous change in the muscle mechanics using muscle twitch response. Aims 1 & 2 will include a focus on the differential role of oral contraceptives. In Aim 3 we will use paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation during active contraction to determine the influence of sex hormone fluctuations on cortical excitability in naturally cycling women. Our findings have the potential to guide future research in injury prevention strategies, including targeted neuromuscular training. This knowledge will enable clinicians to educate female patients on neuromuscular effects of sex hormones during times of high fluctuations, including puberty, pregnancy, and menopause. Sex hormone concentrations fluctuate across the menstrual cycle, which may play a significant role in the substantially higher rate of knee injury in female athletes than in males. The goal of this proposal is to test our central hypothesis that sex hormone fluctuations result in changes to the basic elements of motor control along the full neuro-muscular axis – from muscle to the brain. Our findings have the potential to guide future research in injury prevention strategies, and the knowledge gained will enable clinicians to educate female patients on neuromuscular effects of sex hormones during times of high fluctuations, including puberty, pregnancy, and menopause.",EMRSHN: Exploring the modulatory role of sex hormones along the neuromechanical axis in females,9342667,R01AR069176,"['Affect ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Contraceptive Agents ', ' Contraceptives ', ' Oral Contraceptives ', ' birth control pill ', ' Elements ', ' Estradiol ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' H-Reflex ', ' Health ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Incidence ', ' Interneurons ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Knee Injuries ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Ligaments ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Menopause ', ' menopausal ', ' Female Change of Life ', ' Menstrual cycle ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' motoneuron ', ' Motor Cell ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Muscle ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Musculoskeletal System ', ' locomotor system ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Progesterone ', ' Therapeutic Progesterone ', ' Pregnenedione ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione ', ' Delta4-pregnene-3,20-dione ', ' Corpus Luteum Hormone ', ' Puberty ', ' Reflex action ', ' Reflex ', ' stretch reflex ', ' myotatic reflex ', ' muscle spindle reflex ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' sex steroid ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Sports ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Anterior Cruciate Ligament ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Glean ', ' injury prevention ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Anterior ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' tibialis anterior ', ' Anterior Tibial Muscle ', ' tibialis anterior muscle ', ' injury of musculoskeleted system ', ' injury of musculoskeletal system (disorder) ', ' musculoskeletal injury ', ' digital reflex ', "" Hoffmann's sign "", "" Hoffman's Reflex "", ' Knowledge ', ' Torque ', ' programs ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' joint injury ', ' joint trauma ', ' joint damage ', ' ligament injury ', ' ligament damage ', ' damage to ligament ', ' Transcranial magnetic stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Hormonal ', ' Spinal ', ' experience ', ' neuromuscular system ', ' neuromotor system ', ' stimulus interval ', ' cohort ', ' Stretching ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Reporting ', ' psychological distress ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' strength training ', ' resistance training ', ' muscle strengthening ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' hormone regulation ', ' hormonal regulation ', ' pill ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' quadriceps muscle ', ' quadriceps ', ' sex ', ' Output ', ' neuromuscular ', ' neuronal excitability ', ' neuromechanical ', ' Neuromechanics ', ' locomotor learning ', ' motor learning ', ' motor control ', ' rectus femoris ', ' mechanical properties ', ' ']",NIAMS,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2018,678081,0.15273042452512595
"Catalyzing Young Driver Research via Data Linkage: Development of a Comprehensive Traffic Safety Data Warehouse Project Abstract High-quality linkage of motor vehicle crash data to other existing data sources has the potential to catalyze advancements in our understanding of crashes—the leading cause of death among US adolescents. However, the field of young driver safety relies heavily on studies that analyze only publically available de-identified crash data. Analyzing crash data in isolation restricts the study period to essentially a few minutes and has important limitations that hinder the ability to utilize crash data to validly conduct critical research. Thus, the long-term goal of this R21 project is to harness the power of linked crash data to enhance knowledge of the contributors to and burden of young driver crashes. Over the last five years, the project team has developed a unique linked database—the New Jersey Traffic Safety Outcomes (NJ-TSO) database—that contains the full driver licensing, police-reported crash, and traffic citation data of all NJ drivers (10 million) from 2004 through 2014. The overall objective of the proposed project is to extend this program of research by integrating three additional statewide sources of data in NJ: birth certificate, hospital discharge, and death certificate data. The resultant NJ-TSO data warehouse, which will include individual-level longitudinal data that span the continuum from underlying contributing factors and relevant previous events to injury outcomes and death, is innovative as it will be the most comprehensive data resource focused on young drivers to date. The project has three specific aims. First, the NJ-TSO data warehouse will be created by fully integrating the three additional statewide data sources using established probabilistic linkage methods. Second, key analytic data elements will be derived for all licensed drivers and all crash-involved drivers. These will include: (1) geocoded residential addresses in order to increase the utility of the warehouse to support future spatial and neighborhood-level analyses; (2) race and ethnicity— data elements that are not included in NJ licensing or crash data but are critical to the conduct of foundational and policy-relevant young driver research—using a combination of the newly-integrated data sources and Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding methods; and (3) crash injuries/fatalities using a combination of data sources. Third, the project will make a unique methodological contribution by quantifying the magnitude and direction of bias introduced by using crash report data (vs. hospital/death) to ascertain crash-related injuries. The proposed research is significant in that the resultant warehouse will be fully primed to directly address critical, high-priority research questions in young driver safety. As the NJ-TSO warehouse will include drivers of all ages, it will also have the potential to serve as a data resource for collaborations on a wide array of high-priority areas of traffic safety, including: impaired driving; unlicensed driver crashes; older driver (> age 65) crashes; pedestrian and pedalcyclist injuries; and child passenger safety. This will ensure that the project optimizes the ability of the NJ-TSO data warehouse to improve public health and the safety of all road users. Project Narrative High-quality linkage of motor vehicle crash data to other existing administrative data sources has the potential to catalyze advancements in our understanding of crashes—the leading cause of death among US adolescents. The proposed study will link five population-level data sources from the state of New Jersey (birth certificate, driver licensing, police-reported crash, hospital discharge, and death certificate data) in order to create the most comprehensive data warehouse focused on young drivers to date. The resultant warehouse will be primed to support critical, high-priority studies that advance young driver safety as well as to serve as a resource for collaborations on a wide range of topics in traffic safety research, thereby optimizing its ability to advance public health and improve the safety of all road users.",Catalyzing Young Driver Research via Data Linkage: Development of a Comprehensive Traffic Safety Data Warehouse,9533637,R21HD092850,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Birth Certificates ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Death Certificates ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Licensure ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New Jersey ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Suspensions ', ' Suspension substance ', ' Time ', ' Police ', ' Injury ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Fostering ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Licensing ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Collaborations ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' profession allied to medicine ', ' allied health professional ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Data Element ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' childhood trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' driving while impaired ', ' Impaired Driving ', ' impaired driving performance ', ' older driver ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Young driver ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Data Analytics ', ' data resource ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Banks ', ' data warehouse ', ' ']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2018,263449,0.11567705862468623
"Disparities in Disability after Traumatic Brain Injury for Hispanic Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability for children in the U.S. Disability after TBI is higher among children with no or government insurance, poor family functioning and lower levels of parental education. In a preliminary study, we documented disparities in long term disability after TBI for Hispanic children; Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) children experience significantly larger reductions in health related quality of life, participation in activities, and ability to communicate and care for themselves 3 years after injury. It is unclear if use of rehabilitation services and/or cultural and language barriers contributed to the documented differences. We propose a three-phase research plan to compare patterns and determinants of utilization of rehabilitation services and its association with disability outcomes between Hispanic, NHW and non-Hispanic Black (NHB) children. We will also develop and pilot-test the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally tailored intervention to reduce barriers for use of rehabilitation services by Hispanic children with TBI. The long term goal of this K23 award is for the candidate to develop as an independent researcher in the area of patient outcomes in vulnerable populations and pediatric trauma disparities research. The K23 candidate is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at the University of Washington. The candidate proposes a five-year training plan with the support of faculty mentors who have expertise in injury outcomes research, community based participatory research, qualitative methods, and intervention trials in minority communities. The University of Washington, Seattle Children's Hospital, and Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center provide excellent institutional support and resources for this award. The research involves three studies. Study 1 will compare use of inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services between Hispanic, NHB and NHW pediatric patients with TBI, and its association with disability. Study 2 will compare predisposing enabling and need factors for use of outpatient rehabilitation services between the three ethnic groups. Study 3 will develop and pilot-test a culturally tailored intervention to reduce barriers fr use of rehabilitation services by Hispanic children with TBI. These studies will expand our understanding of the potential reasons for disparities in the provision of care for children with TBI. It will clarify the role of Hispanic ethnicity in the receipt of rehabilitation care and highe risk of disability after TBI, independent of socioeconomic and minority status. It will lay the groundwork for a multicenter study to evaluate a culturally tailored intervention to reduce barriers for use of rehabilitation services by Hispanic families, which can also serve as a model for other vulnerable populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Significant disparities in long term disability after traumatic brain injury (TBI) exist for Hispanic children. Identifying patterns and determinants for use of rehabilitation services after TBI will reveal risk factors that can allow intervention strategies t be targeted more effectively to Hispanic Children and other vulnerable populations.

"A NW Tribal EpiCenter Collaboration to Improve the Use of Motor Vehicle Injury Data Abstract American Indians and Alaska Natives(AI/AN) are disproportionately affected by motor vehicle injuries and fatalities. As sovereign nations, tribes are often responsible for policies, practices, and infrastructure improvements to address these problems. The Northwest Tribal Epidemiology Center (The EpiCenter) is tasked with responding to the data needs of the 43 NW Tribes, including motor vehicle injury related information. While The EpiCenter does provide state- specific AI/AN fatality data and hospital discharge injury data, tribes have repeatedly requested local injury data, as well as crash data to inform decision-making. We initiate this proposal in response to these requests and needs of the tribes. We plan to use race-corrected data sources we have in-house at the EpiCenter – death certificates, hospital discharge data and trauma registries – to evaluate the magnitude of the MV injury disparity and to report and map injury data to as local of level as possible. We will also utilize other data sources that are not race corrected, including Fatality Analysis Reporting System, and syndromic surveillance data (near real-time clinical data from Emergency Departments, urgent care facilities and other medical clinics) to illuminate injury severity and understand crash-related factors. We will undertake quality improvement of these data as necessary. We will complement these quantitative data with qualitative data to help us understand the context of the problem, identify where tribes need increased capacity, and to paint a more complete picture of AI/AN motor vehicle injuries and deaths. Because motor vehicle injuries fall under the scope of work of several different departments – planning, law enforcement, transportation, policy and health – information and the use of data can be disjointed. This proposal will bring together experts from these fields to respond to the data, identify and assist in quality improvement efforts, and ensure that analyses and reports are useful to decision-makers in various capacities. Project Narrative This project brings together multiple motor vehicle injury data sources and experts to inform Tribal EpiCenter efforts toward reducing the American Indian injury and death disparity. We will describe the motor vehicle injury distribution, disparity, and give tribes as local of data as possible.

"Pediatric Injury; Modules to Manage Medical Stress PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and associated psychological impairment affect from 25 to 57% of children after an injury and contribute to worse health related quality of life. Because children's PTSS emerge after they are discharged home from the hospital, they are often invisible to the trauma system and are neither detected nor treated. Although evidence-based treatment for PTSS exists, limited parental awareness and access to trained providers hinder community access. The goal of this project is to provide a research and treatment resource for the management of psychological distress in children who have been hospitalized for a physical trauma. In Aim 1, we will develop an innovative, brief e-health approach to treatment of PTSS designed to be delivered through the trauma system. We will create interactive web-based psychoeducational modules that are developmentally tailored for school age children (8 to 11 years) and youth (12 to 16 years) for use with synchronous e-health therapy sessions with a trained therapist. Modules will target two evidence based treatment methods: cognitive behavioral therapy coping skills (coping CBT) and direct exposure to trauma reminders through a trauma narrative. All modules will be piloted iteratively with parent, child, and expert practitioner input incorporated at each step. We will develop parent modules that accompany the child treatment programs that address parent concerns including managing their own stress, parenting skills and how to help children with a common injury-specific concern, sleep. Treatment resources will be designed specifically for ease of dissemination and incorporation into the trauma system. In Aim 2, we will perform a pilot three-armed RCT to examine the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the two brief treatments (coping CBT and trauma narrative) compared to an untreated comparison group (N = 54). Injured children and their families will be recruited to participate from the inpatient wards of the three participating sites. The treatment program will serve as a research resource for a subsequent large clinical trial designed to confirm efficacy and to examine potential treatment modifiers. To aid in dissemination of this treatment resource, we will create a webinar that provides training in the use of the manualized therapies and online modules. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children who develop psychological distress after being hospitalized for an injury often have difficulty accessing evidence-based treatment. This project will develop multimedia treatment modules that are tailored to the needs and developmental levels of children ages 8 to 16 years old with post- traumatic psychological distress that can be used on-line with therapist support.

"Effectiveness of a safety intervention for dating violence DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intimate partner violence (IPV), including violence in dating relationships (dating violence, DV) is a widespread and serious public health problem. Among U.S. female IPV survivors, 47.1% report their first abusive relationship occurred at college age (age 18-24). Similarly, in national surveys, adults respondents 18-24 years of age report the highest rate of stalking victimization, most commonly by a former intimate partner. Safety planning is the most widely used intervention to prevent and respond to DV/IPV, yet the vast majority of abused women never access safety planning services. Our challenge is to increase college women's access and use of safety planning, with the opportunity to consider their unique safety priorities and level of danger during and when ending an abusive relationship. In addition, while ""bystander"" interventions that train peers to safely intervene hav been shown to be effective in sexual assault prevention on campus, and college women in abusive relationships most frequently disclose DV/IPV to a friend, no similar interventions have been tested with friends for DV/IPV response on campuses. Therefore, the objective of the 5-year study is to evaluate the: 1) effectiveness of an interactive, personalized safety decision application (""App""), called iPlan, intervention in Maryland and Oregon with: 1) college women (age 18-24) who experience DV/IPV and 2) friends (age 18-24) of women experiencing DV/IPV. The iPlan App allows the user to enter information on: a) relationship health; b) safety priorities and c) severity of violence/danger in relationship. The App then uses the information to provide the user with a personalized safety plan with links to campus/local resources; and 2) dissemination of the iPlan App in partnership with the One Love Foundation, a national advocacy organization, in an expanded four states (Arizona, Maryland, Missouri, and Oregon) to determine the reach, adoption, implementation and maintenance of App use among university/college students. Our study will address the paucity of evidence that exists on how to disseminate effective safety interventions to prevent and respond to DV/IPV on large and diverse university/college campuses. Despite the significant evidence of negative health and social outcomes of DV/IPV across the lifespan, and the complex priorities that influence safety for college women and friends, little is known about what interventions are most effective and what dissemination approaches are best suited to prevent and respond to DV/IPV university/college campuses. The findings from the study will begin to address this paucity of evidence and assist in implementation of national DV/IPV safety interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The study addresses National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) priorities to develop and test interventions to reduce disparities and improve the health of women and children through their lifespan. Research findings will inform the science for large-scale implementation of a technology advanced DV/IPV safety interventions for a high risk population, university/college students in a high risk setting, university/college campuses.",Effectiveness of a safety intervention for dating violence,9480090,R01HD076881,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Age Reporting ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Arizona ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Control Groups ', ' Faculty ', ' Female ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Interview ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Maryland ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Missouri ', ' Names ', ' Oregon ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Privacy ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' violence prevention ', ' prevent violence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' sexual attack ', ' assaulted sexually ', ' sexual assault ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' abuse of women ', ' abuse of females ', ' Abused women ', ' Abused females ', ' Battered Women ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Respondent ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' university student ', ' college student ', ' peer ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Age-Years ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' dating violence ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' Outcome ', ' abusive relationship ', ' relationship abuse ', ' advocacy organizations ', ' high risk ', ' loved ones ', ' public health relevance ', ' social media ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' ']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,580837,0.09200265854780769
"Building Research Capacity for Firearm Safety Among Children Among U.S. children, firearm-related fatalities are the 2nd leading cause of death and include the unintentional, accidental discharge of a firearm by a toddler with a playmate, the use of a firearm to self-inflict harm by a suicidal teen, and the escalation of bullying or dating violence to lethal means by an adolescent. Substantial disparities exist in firearm-related injuries, with African-American children disproportionally impacted by unintentional and assaultive firearm injury, and rural youth disproportionately dying of suicide by firearm. Childhood firearm injury rates have remained unchanged in the recent decades despite significant reductions in non-firearm fatal injuries due to an approach that includes improved epidemiologic data, behavior modifications, and technological solutions. In contrast, research funding and publications for firearm injury have lagged, leading to a current deficit of both established and developing researchers, as well as a lack of pilot work and literature needed to support large scale studies. A 2013 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report detailed the urgent need for novel and innovative research to address this deficit, however, was primarily focused on adult populations. This proposal builds on these IOM recommendations and utilizes multidisciplinary research expertise across the U.S., as well as stakeholder partner groups of gun owners, to catalyze the science of childhood firearm injury prevention with the overarching goal of reducing firearm injuries among children while also respecting gun ownership as an important part of the cultural fabric of US society. Our specific aims are: Aim #1: Create a multidisciplinary team of researchers and stakeholder partners to define a pediatric-specific firearm injury research agenda for the five workgroups; Aim #2: Stimulate novel firearm prevention research by having workgroups conduct pilot studies that address key research questions identified in Aim 1, to provide preliminary data that informs large-scale studies; Aim #3: Improve access to and use of national firearm data and ease future secondary analyses by: 1) Establishing a web-based searchable data archive for childhood firearm injury that is enabled with variable-level searching and cross-study comparisons; and, 2) Enhancing and improving pediatric firearm injury data collection in existing pediatric datasets such as the PECARN core data project and the PECARN registry database; Aim #4: Build a cadre of national research scholars with multidisciplinary training and expertise that will serve as an emerging pipeline for future research. Expected outcomes of this five-year grant will be to create six research resources: 1) consensus documents detailing the state of the science and key research questions for pediatric firearm injury prevention; 2) pilot data to support five large-scale research proposals; 3) a web-based data archive and searchable research repository on childhood firearm injury; 4) enhanced data collection opportunities on childhood firearm injuries through existing national networks (e.g., PECARN); 5) a cadre of new researchers (postdoctoral students) focused in this research area; and 6) a webinar series to inform researchers nationally in this topic area. PROJECT NARRATIVE Among U.S. children, firearm-related fatalities are the 2nd leading cause of death. Our proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of researchers and community stakeholder groups (gun advocates, gun safety trainers, veterans, family groups) across the U.S. to inform and catalyze the science of childhood firearm injury prevention by addressing both the gaps in research and human resources. The overarching goal of the project is to reduce the number of firearm injuries occurring among children.

"Hired Latino Youth Farmworkers: Work Organization, Safety, Hazards, and Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Agriculture is a unique industry in the United States in the manner in which youth can be involved. Youth as young as 14 years of age can be employed to do farm work without parental consent, and youth as young as 10 years can be employed to do farm work with parental consent. Youth employed in agriculture can work with sharp tools, machinery, and pesticides, as well as do the strenuous tasks of planting, cultivating and harvesting crops, and working with large animals. The rates of injuries and illness among youth agricultural workers are extremely high. The safety and health of hired youth migrant and seasonal farmworkers are seldom considered in analyses of child agricultural injuries. Hired youth farmworkers are part of the larger vulnerable immigrant farmworker community, and include children in seasonal farmworker families, those in migrant families, and unaccompanied youth. Migrant and seasonal farmworkers are a vulnerable population that experiences significant health disparities; the experiences of youth hired Latino farmworkers, which includes harassment and abuse, places them at even greater risk. However, little research has documented the safety and health of youth hired Latino farmworkers. This project is based on a community-based participatory research collaboration between community advocates, youth, and academic investigators. Focused on youth farmworkers aged 10 to 15 years, it will use a mixed-methods approach that combines qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with longitudinal statistical data from detailed interviews, clinical examinations, and biomarkers to address 3 specific aims: (1) describe the common work experiences of hired Latino youth farmworkers, including why and when they work, the tasks they perform, their training and supervision, their working conditions, the benefits and hazards they perceive are associated with work, and how they believe farm work influences their health; (2) delineate (a) the personal and developmental characteristics, work characteristics, work organization, and work safety culture of hired Latino youth farmworkers; (b) the work related occupational, environmental, and social hazards they experience; and (c) their behavioral, psychological, and physical health characteristics; and (3) determine the (a) associations of work characteristics and hazards of hired Latino youth farmworkers with their health characteristics; and (b) how the associations of work characteristics and hazards with health are affected by their work organization, safety culture, and developmental characteristics. This project is significant and innovative because it will provide longitudinal data on the occupational hazards experienced by hired youth farmworkers, and document the work organization and work safety culture in which they work. It examines how agricultural work and hazards affect immediate physical injury, but also how these factors influence the psychological and behavioral health of these children. This information will inform safety process and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hired youth farmworkers experience high rates of occupational injury. Data are needed delineate how work organization and safety culture are associated with hazards and health outcomes among these youth workers. This project uses a mixed-methods design and community-based participatory research approach to delineate the characteristics of hired youth farmworkers, their occupational hazards, and their work organization and safety culture characteristics.","Hired Latino Youth Farmworkers: Work Organization, Safety, Hazards, and Health",9418065,R01HD084420,"['Affect ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Animals ', ' assault ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communities ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Drowning ', ' Employment ', ' Family ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Housing ', ' Industry ', ' Interview ', ' literacy ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Nomads ', ' Migrant ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Pesticides ', ' Plants ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Siblings ', ' Supervision ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' self injury ', ' self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' intentional self harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' falls ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Social Network ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Rural ', ' agriculture worker ', ' Agricultural Workers ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' farm worker ', ' farmworker ', ' tool ', ' occupational hazard ', ' Hour ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Occupational ', ' Farming environment ', ' Farm ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' Parental Consent ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' behavioral health ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Fatality rate ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' injured ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' migration ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ten years of age ', ' ten year old ', ' age 10 years ', ' 10 years of age ', ' 10 year old ', ' fourteen years of age ', ' fourteen year old ', ' age 14 years ', ' 14 years of age ', ' 14 year old ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' social science research ', ' workplace environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' work environment ', ' supportive environment ', ' peer-group environment ', ' job environment ', ' interdisciplinary environment ', ' interactive environment ', ' informal environment ', ' enthusiastic environment ', ' competitive environment ', ' business-friendly environment ', ' collaborative environment ', ' Fatal injury ', ' Occupational injury ', ' Child Health ', ' ']",NICHD,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,596882,0.03663769723628733
"Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing Project Summary  Safety net providers treat a substantial share of socioeconomically vulnerable patients in their communities, but struggle to provide timely access to high quality specialty care for their patients. Delayed access to specialty care is associated with worse health outcomes and potentially contributes to health disparities across socioeconomic groups. Given their limited resources, safety net providers must seek creative approaches to improve specialty access. However, to choose what programs to implement, safety net providers need to understand the specialty care needs of their populations. Fortunately, the adoption of eConsult systems by safety net providers across the US provides a valuable opportunity to systematically measure patterns of specialty care referrals for minority, underserved populations.  In this project, we propose using state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to help safety net providers extract actionable, population wide data from their electronic consultation systems. We will do this in partnership with three of the most prominent safety net health systems in the US in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. Using specialty request databases from our collaborators, we will build NLP systems to automatically classify specialty requests along two dimensions: the “clinical issue” motivating the request (e.g., chest pain), and the “question type” (e.g., request for a procedure, help with medication management). This automated classification of electronic specialty requests can enable identification of promising targets for interventions to improve specialty access and quality of care.  After developing these NLP systems, we will analyze >1 million specialty requests to describe trends in how safety net patients are referred to specialists and examine variation in referral patterns by clinic and individual provider. The goal is to identify the most impactful opportunities to improve specialty access and quality. For example, a high rate of referrals for esophageal reflux, which most PCPs can treat on their own with specialist guidance, could lead to new treatment algorithms, potentially reducing the need for these requests and improving access for other patients.  This proposal is a “high-risk high-reward” project that creates new research tools to identify and evaluate data-driven interventions to improve specialty care delivery for underserved populations. Project Narrative Access to timely, high-quality specialty care is a fundamental component of a well-functioning health system, yet safety net health care providers face persistent challenges delivering such care. Quality improvement efforts to improve specialty access have been thwarted in part because safety net providers lack the data to understand a basic question – why patients are referred for specialty care. Taking advantage of the growing use of electronic specialty referral systems by safety net providers, we propose using natural language processing to conduct automated analysis and classification of specialty requests in safety net populations, which will enable the design of targeted interventions to improve specialty care access and delivery.",Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing,9600732,R21MD012693,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Chest Pain ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Medical Education ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Gastroesophageal reflux disease ', ' Gastroesophageal Reflux ', ' Gastro-oesophageal Reflux ', ' GERD ', ' Esophageal Reflux ', ' Acid Reflux ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitals ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' New York City ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' retinopathy ', ' retina disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Triage ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Specialist ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Medication Management ', ' medication therapy management ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' diabetic ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Medical center ', ' care delivery ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' performance tests ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' trend ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' two-dimensional ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' high risk ', ' high reward ', ' screening ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2018,278902,0.06733982770175691
"Tiny Cargo, Big Deal! An Adaptive ED-Based eHealth Intervention to Promote Correct and Consistent Size-Appropriate Child Passenger Safety Behaviors and Reduce Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY Motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) remain the leading cause of unintentional injury deaths among children in the United States (U.S.) and racial/ethnic minority children are disproportionately impacted as suboptimal child passenger safety behaviors are more prevalent in some communities. Existing universal approaches to promote child passenger safety have fallen short of ensuring that all child passengers are correctly using size- appropriate child passenger restraints according to guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Precision prevention programs are urgently needed to improve child passenger safety behaviors among caregivers who have not been responsive to guidelines, laws, and public education campaigns. The proposed research will test the efficacy of Tiny Cargo, Big Deal (TCBD), an emergency department (ED)-based precision prevention intervention grounded in Self- Determination Theory. TCBD integrates personalized counseling based on principles of motivational interviewing (MI) and eHealth components including a tailored educational web application (app) and short message service (SMS) communications with the goal of improving child passenger safety. We hypothesize that by providing tailored child passenger safety education and personalized skills for restraint use in a manner that supports autonomous motivation the TCBD intervention will be more efficacious than universal approaches (laws/guidelines) for realizing correct use of size-appropriate child passenger restraints. The primary outcomes, size-appropriate restraint use and the Child Passenger Safety Score (CPaSS), will be assessed with direct observation at scheduled, in-person appointments and remote observation of digital photographs submitted by caregivers in response to unscheduled text messages. We will test our hypothesis using a randomized adaptive trial design with the following aims: Aim 1: To refine and verify the reliability of elements in the 100-point CPaSS, a novel composite measure of child passenger safety. Aim 2: To test the efficacy of the TCBD intervention compared to usual care for improving primary outcomes [i.e., size- appropriate restraint (dichotomous) and CPaSS-D (numeric)] at 6 and 12 months. Aim 3: To use latent growth curve models to identify characteristic trajectories for the CPaSS-R observed in digital photographs over the 12 study months and assess for correlates of the trajectory types. This innovative, theoretically grounded research will have long-standing impact on child passenger safety by informing the best methods to increase correct use of size-appropriate child restraint systems among caregivers of diverse backgrounds at the point they interact with the health care system. The work has the potential for wide-scale implementation in the ED and for translation to primary care offices, schools, and community settings with an ultimate goal of eliminating child passenger safety disparities and reducing the number of childhood injuries from MVCs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Injuries sustained by young children in motor vehicle crashes are a significant and costly public health concern. The correct and consistent use of a size-appropriate child passenger restraint can mitigate the risk of injury for children younger than 11 who are involved in a crash.

"Implementation of a Safety Program in Guatemala ABSTRACT ‐ ‐ Medical and surgical care is fraught with hazards, particularly in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Powerful institutional wide processes to improve health safety have come from high reliability organizations (HROs) which have advocated adoption of a “culture of safety,” which is the shared values, attitudes, perceptions, and patterns of behavior that determine the effort with which staff direct their attention towards minimizing patient harm. Measures of staff perceptions about safety culture–termed the “safety climate”– are critical to develop quality improvement efforts. Our overall goal‐is to improve surgical safety for children by building a safety culture in resource constrained settings. Following measurement of the safety climate at two ‐ pediatric units in two public hospitals in Guatemala using a low cost, standardized, electronic survey tool, we will assess the implementation of the SCORE safety program at these two units. Our research team is a public private partnership (PPP) composed of Guatemalan hospital leadership, U.S. academic experts, and social entrepreneurs from a private U.S. patient safety organization. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to improve the safety and quality of pediatric care at public hospitals in Guatemala.

"Tiny Cargo, Big Deal! An Adaptive ED-Based eHealth Intervention to Promote Correct and Consistent Size-Appropriate Child Passenger Safety Behaviors and Reduce Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY Motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) remain the leading cause of unintentional injury deaths among children in the United States (U.S.) and racial/ethnic minority children are disproportionately impacted as suboptimal child passenger safety behaviors are more prevalent in some communities. Existing universal approaches to promote child passenger safety have fallen short of ensuring that all child passengers are correctly using size- appropriate child passenger restraints according to guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Precision prevention programs are urgently needed to improve child passenger safety behaviors among caregivers who have not been responsive to guidelines, laws, and public education campaigns. The proposed research will test the efficacy of Tiny Cargo, Big Deal (TCBD), an emergency department (ED)-based precision prevention intervention grounded in Self- Determination Theory. TCBD integrates personalized counseling based on principles of motivational interviewing (MI) and eHealth components including a tailored educational web application (app) and short message service (SMS) communications with the goal of improving child passenger safety. We hypothesize that by providing tailored child passenger safety education and personalized skills for restraint use in a manner that supports autonomous motivation the TCBD intervention will be more efficacious than universal approaches (laws/guidelines) for realizing correct use of size-appropriate child passenger restraints. The primary outcomes, size-appropriate restraint use and the Child Passenger Safety Score (CPaSS), will be assessed with direct observation at scheduled, in-person appointments and remote observation of digital photographs submitted by caregivers in response to unscheduled text messages. We will test our hypothesis using a randomized adaptive trial design with the following aims: Aim 1: To refine and verify the reliability of elements in the 100-point CPaSS, a novel composite measure of child passenger safety. Aim 2: To test the efficacy of the TCBD intervention compared to usual care for improving primary outcomes [i.e., size- appropriate restraint (dichotomous) and CPaSS-D (numeric)] at 6 and 12 months. Aim 3: To use latent growth curve models to identify characteristic trajectories for the CPaSS-R observed in digital photographs over the 12 study months and assess for correlates of the trajectory types. This innovative, theoretically grounded research will have long-standing impact on child passenger safety by informing the best methods to increase correct use of size-appropriate child restraint systems among caregivers of diverse backgrounds at the point they interact with the health care system. The work has the potential for wide-scale implementation in the ED and for translation to primary care offices, schools, and community settings with an ultimate goal of eliminating child passenger safety disparities and reducing the number of childhood injuries from MVCs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Injuries sustained by young children in motor vehicle crashes are a significant and costly public health concern. The correct and consistent use of a size-appropriate child passenger restraint can mitigate the risk of injury for children younger than 11 who are involved in a crash. The proposed Tiny Cargo, Big Deal precision prevention intervention is grounded in Self-Determination Theory and uses successful strategies for behavior change, including counseling based on principles of motivational interviewing and tailored eHealth communications. The overarching goal is to improve child passenger safety behaviors among diverse caregivers of children recommended to use a car seat or booster seat who contact the health system through the emergency department.","Tiny Cargo, Big Deal!

"EMRSHN: Exploring the modulatory role of sex hormones along the neuromechanical axis in females The rate of musculoskeletal injury differs substantially between men and women, with the incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries up to 9 times higher in female athletes. These injuries cause short- and long- term health problems, including time lost from school or work, psychological distress, and post-injury joint osteoarthritis. Sex hormones may make a significant contribution to this injury disparity: injury rate differences are not evident until puberty, and injuries occur disproportionately in the first half of the menstrual cycle. While most research has focused on passive components of the musculoskeletal system, arguing that female fluctuating hormone concentrations may change mechanical properties of the ligament itself, a direct link between ligament laxity and ACL injury has not been proven. The goal of this proposal is to test our central hypothesis that changes in sex hormone concentration result in changes to the basic elements of motor control – at multiple levels, from the musculotendinous unit to motor control circuitry. In our preliminary data, at the muscle level, we have shown that the muscle reflex response is lowest when estradiol concentrations are highest, with no change in anterior knee laxity. At the spinal circuitry level, we have shown that while day-to-day changes in hormone concentration do not modulate spinal motor neuronal excitability, a lower overall level of excitability exists in women who take oral contraceptives. Finally, at the level of the brain, we have shown the excitability of intra-cortical interneuronal circuits is increased when estradiol concentrations are highest. In Aims 1 & 2 of our proposal, daily testing will allow, as never-before, a detailed assessment of the time-specific relationship between hormone concentration and changes at the muscle and spinal level during both relaxed and active states. In Aim 3, daily hormone concentrations will specifically determine each subject's testing day, guiding targeted assessments into the role of fluctuating hormone concentrations on cortical excitability. In Aim 1 we will determine the influence of sex hormone fluctuations on the muscle stretch reflex during active and passive states, and the time-lag between hormone concentration changes and the reflex response. We will use a technically simple assessment that could be implemented in the field. In Aim 2 we will determine the influence of sex hormone fluctuations on spinal motor neuron excitability using H-reflex as a probe and the simultaneous change in the muscle mechanics using muscle twitch response. Aims 1 & 2 will include a focus on the differential role of oral contraceptives. In Aim 3 we will use paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation during active contraction to determine the influence of sex hormone fluctuations on cortical excitability in naturally cycling women. Our findings have the potential to guide future research in injury prevention strategies, including targeted neuromuscular training. This knowledge will enable clinicians to educate female patients on neuromuscular effects of sex hormones during times of high fluctuations, including puberty, pregnancy, and menopause. Sex hormone concentrations fluctuate across the menstrual cycle, which may play a significant role in the substantially higher rate of knee injury in female athletes than in males. The goal of this proposal is to test our central hypothesis that sex hormone fluctuations result in changes to the basic elements of motor control along the full neuro-muscular axis – from muscle to the brain. Our findings have the potential to guide future research in injury prevention strategies, and the knowledge gained will enable clinicians to educate female patients on neuromuscular effects of sex hormones during times of high fluctuations, including puberty, pregnancy, and menopause.",EMRSHN: Exploring the modulatory role of sex hormones along the neuromechanical axis in females,9906129,R01AR069176,"['Affect ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Contraceptives ', ' Contraceptive Agents ', ' birth control pill ', ' Oral Contraceptives ', ' Elements ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estradiol ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' H-Reflex ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Incidence ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Interneurons ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Knee Injuries ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Ligaments ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' menopausal ', ' Female Change of Life ', ' Menopause ', ' Menstrual cycle ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' motoneuron ', ' Motor Cell ', ' Motor Neurons ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Muscle ', ' locomotor system ', ' Musculoskeletal System ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Therapeutic Progesterone ', ' Pregnenedione ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione ', ' Delta4-pregnene-3,20-dione ', ' Corpus Luteum Hormone ', ' Progesterone ', ' Puberty ', ' Reflex ', ' Reflex action ', ' myotatic reflex ', ' muscle spindle reflex ', ' stretch reflex ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' sex steroid ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' Sports ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Anterior Cruciate Ligament ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Glean ', ' injury prevention ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Anterior ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' tibialis anterior muscle ', ' tibialis anterior ', ' Anterior Tibial Muscle ', ' musculoskeletal injury ', ' injury of musculoskeleted system ', ' injury of musculoskeletal system (disorder) ', "" Hoffman's Reflex "", ' digital reflex ', "" Hoffmann's sign "", ' Knowledge ', ' Torque ', ' programs ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' joint injury ', ' joint trauma ', ' joint damage ', ' ligament injury ', ' ligament damage ', ' damage to ligament ', ' Transcranial magnetic stimulation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' Pattern ', ' Hormonal ', ' Spinal ', ' experience ', ' neuromuscular system ', ' neuromotor system ', ' stimulus interval ', ' cohort ', ' Stretching ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Reporting ', ' psychological distress ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' strength training ', ' resistance training ', ' muscle strengthening ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' hormone regulation ', ' hormonal regulation ', ' pill ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' quadriceps muscle ', ' quadriceps ', ' sex ', ' Output ', ' neuromuscular ', ' neuronal excitability ', ' Neuromechanics ', ' neuromechanical ', ' motor learning ', ' locomotor learning ', ' motor control ', ' rectus femoris ', ' mechanical properties ', ' Sex Differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' ']",NIAMS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,720484,0.15273042452512595
"VALES+Tú: Targeting psychosocial stressors to reduce Latino Day Laborers injury disparities VALES+Tú: Targeting Psychosocial Stressors to Reduce Latino Day Laborers Injury Disparities Even as the safety of US workers continues to improve overall, the safety of Latino workers, especially day laborers, continues to deteriorate. Latino day laborers (LDL) are predominantly Spanish monolingual immigrant workers who experience multiple psychosocial stressors, including situational and immigration stress that amplify their risk for injury at work. LDL look for work at informal hiring sites or “corners” where they get hired intermittently to do a variety of entry-level jobs whose shifting conditions expose them to multiple safety hazards. The most alarming consequence of this constant rotation across unpredictable, dangerous jobs is the high rate of job-related fatalities in this population. Despite the urgent need, there are no effective and rigorously tested safety programs, portable to the corner where LDL wait for work, to help them cope with stressors that increase their risk for workplace injury. Our project's main goal is to address this question: Can a corner-based safety program addressing the psycho social stressors confronted by LDL reduce their reported exposure to hazardous conditions at work? Our proposed project, VALES+Tú (You are worth/worthy of more) is a 5 year community-based participatory program developed in partnership with Latino day laborers whose pilot results provide evidence of increasing risk reduction practices and reducing hazardous exposures at work. We are proposing to implement a multilevel intervention delivered in Spanish by LDL promotores to their peers at the corners and to test the program's effectiveness in a cluster randomized trial. The central aims of the project are: (1) to determine the efficacy of VALES+Tú in reducing hazardous exposures at work, and (2) to determine the mediating effect of psychosocial stressors on the primary outcomes of VALES+Tú. All project activities will be done in collaboration with our community partner, the Fe y Justicia (Faith and Justice) Worker Center, and with guidance from our Community Advisory Board . The short-term goal of VALES+Tú is to reduce LDL workplace hazards by involving them in a corner-based safety program that effectively addresses seldom targeted situational and immigration stress that increase risky practices at work. Our long-term goal is to reduce the high injury rates among Latino day laborers. Mitigating safety risks among LDL is an urgent public health priority that can be addressed by taking effective, low-cost, preventive action. The purpose of the Vales+Tú study is to implement and evaluate an injury prevention program among Latino day laborers (LDL) in Houston who are at a high risk of experiencing an injury at work. Our main objective is to answer this question: Can a corner-based safety program addressing the psychosocial stressors confronted by LDL reduce their exposure to hazardous conditions at work? In partnership with our Community Advisory Board, we will answer this question by testing the efficacy of the program in a group randomized trial to be conducted at local day labor corners. Our short term goal is to determine if we can reduce hazardous work exposures and our long term goal is to reduce LDL injuries at work.

The Northwest Tribal Epidemiology Center (The EpiCenter) is tasked with responding to the data needs of the 43 NW Tribes, including motor vehicle injury related information. While The EpiCenter does provide state- specific AI/AN fatality data and hospital discharge injury data, tribes have repeatedly requested local injury data, as well as crash data to inform decision-making. We initiate this proposal in response to these requests and needs of the tribes. We plan to use race-corrected data sources we have in-house at the EpiCenter – death certificates, hospital discharge data and trauma registries – to evaluate the magnitude of the MV injury disparity and to report and map injury data to as local of level as possible. We will also utilize other data sources that are not race corrected, including Fatality Analysis Reporting System, and syndromic surveillance data (near real-time clinical data from Emergency Departments, urgent care facilities and other medical clinics) to illuminate injury severity and understand crash-related factors. We will undertake quality improvement of these data as necessary. We will complement these quantitative data with qualitative data to help us understand the context of the problem, identify where tribes need increased capacity, and to paint a more complete picture of AI/AN motor vehicle injuries and deaths. Because motor vehicle injuries fall under the scope of work of several different departments – planning, law enforcement, transportation, policy and health – information and the use of data can be disjointed. This proposal will bring together experts from these fields to respond to the data, identify and assist in quality improvement efforts, and ensure that analyses and reports are useful to decision-makers in various capacities. Project Narrative This project brings together multiple motor vehicle injury data sources and experts to inform Tribal EpiCenter efforts toward reducing the American Indian injury and death disparity. We will describe the motor vehicle injury distribution, disparity, and give tribes as local of data as possible. We will disseminate the data via reports and maps, and undertake data quality improvement efforts as needed.",A NW Tribal EpiCenter Collaboration to Improve the Use of Motor Vehicle Injury Data,9778899,R01MD013353,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Awareness ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death Certificates ', ' Decision Making ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' care facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Idaho ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Oregon ', ' Paint ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Registries ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Tribes ', ' Universities ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Police ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Unintentional Injury ', ' Accidental Injury ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' Injury ', ' Motor Vehicles ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Policies ', ' Data Quality ', ' Collaborations ', ' restraint ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' member ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' repository ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disease registry ', ' injury from motor vehicle accident ', ' injury from car accident ', ' injury due to car accident ', ' car injury ', ' car accident injury ', ' motor vehicle injury ', ' Address ', ' tribal health ', ' tribe health ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Evaluable Disease ', ' Evaluable ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' syndromic surveillance ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' tribal community ', ' tribal organization ', ' tribal board ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' Tribal group ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' evidence base ', ' surveillance data ', ' urgent care ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' public health intervention ', ' health data ', ' Fall injury ', ' tribal lands ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWEST PORTLAND AREA INDIAN HLTH BD,R01,2019,472868,0.22545573699343294
"Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing Project Summary  Safety net providers treat a substantial share of socioeconomically vulnerable patients in their communities, but struggle to provide timely access to high quality specialty care for their patients. Delayed access to specialty care is associated with worse health outcomes and potentially contributes to health disparities across socioeconomic groups. Given their limited resources, safety net providers must seek creative approaches to improve specialty access. However, to choose what programs to implement, safety net providers need to understand the specialty care needs of their populations. Fortunately, the adoption of eConsult systems by safety net providers across the US provides a valuable opportunity to systematically measure patterns of specialty care referrals for minority, underserved populations.  In this project, we propose using state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to help safety net providers extract actionable, population wide data from their electronic consultation systems. We will do this in partnership with three of the most prominent safety net health systems in the US in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. Using specialty request databases from our collaborators, we will build NLP systems to automatically classify specialty requests along two dimensions: the “clinical issue” motivating the request (e.g., chest pain), and the “question type” (e.g., request for a procedure, help with medication management). This automated classification of electronic specialty requests can enable identification of promising targets for interventions to improve specialty access and quality of care.  After developing these NLP systems, we will analyze >1 million specialty requests to describe trends in how safety net patients are referred to specialists and examine variation in referral patterns by clinic and individual provider. The goal is to identify the most impactful opportunities to improve specialty access and quality. For example, a high rate of referrals for esophageal reflux, which most PCPs can treat on their own with specialist guidance, could lead to new treatment algorithms, potentially reducing the need for these requests and improving access for other patients.  This proposal is a “high-risk high-reward” project that creates new research tools to identify and evaluate data-driven interventions to improve specialty care delivery for underserved populations. Project Narrative Access to timely, high-quality specialty care is a fundamental component of a well-functioning health system, yet safety net health care providers face persistent challenges delivering such care. Quality improvement efforts to improve specialty access have been thwarted in part because safety net providers lack the data to understand a basic question – why patients are referred for specialty care. Taking advantage of the growing use of electronic specialty referral systems by safety net providers, we propose using natural language processing to conduct automated analysis and classification of specialty requests in safety net populations, which will enable the design of targeted interventions to improve specialty care access and delivery.",Improving Specialty Care Delivery in the Safety Net with Natural Language Processing,9789060,R21MD012693,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Chest Pain ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Medical Education ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Gastroesophageal Reflux ', ' Gastro-oesophageal Reflux ', ' GERD ', ' Esophageal Reflux ', ' Acid Reflux ', ' Gastroesophageal reflux disease ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Services ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hospitals ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' New York City ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Ophthalmology ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' retinopathy ', ' retina disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Triage ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Specialist ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' medication therapy management ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Medication Management ', ' Caring ', ' Telemedicine ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' diabetic ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' Medical center ', ' care delivery ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' performance tests ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' trend ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Text ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' two-dimensional ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' high risk ', ' high reward ', ' screening ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' minority communities ', ' automated analysis ', ' ']",NIMHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2019,163623,0.06733982770175691
"Achieving Injury-related Health Equity in the National Trauma Healthcare System ABSTRACT The consequences of injuries and violence disproportionately impact persons of color, uninsured individuals, those with limited English proficiency, and those who are geographically isolated. Injuries are the leading cause of death and disability for those aged 1-44 years in the US, and each year 2.5 million individuals are hospitalized and 26.9 million are treated in the Emergency Department as a result of injuries. Total lifetime medical and work loss costs associated with injuries are estimated at $671 billion/year. Existing state-level trauma registry systems currently collect data on injuries, injury care, and patient characteristics and contribute these data to the national trauma databank and the Trauma Quality Improvement Program of the American College of Surgeons. However, there are significant limitations in the current trauma registry systems. Data are not collected on equity-related factors beyond race, such as primary language spoken or income or on longer- term outcomes after hospital discharge. Our group conducted a national Delphi process with key experts to identify a national agenda in injury and health equity. Key priorities included: 1) Inclusion of health equity- related measures in trauma registries and 2) Need for longer-term follow up of patients to examine how local practices and system factors affect the health of injured patients over time and lead to outcome disparities. Systematically accounting for care factors and outcomes by health-equity measures is a critical step towards developing system-level interventions to alleviate health disparities. This study aims to address these priorities within our Trauma Registry system by developing and testing the feasibility of a culturally sensitive data collection instrument and process that can be included in the existing trauma registry systems to capture health equity measures and longer-term outcomes for diverse trauma patients. We will also examine the relationship between health equity measures and longer-term outcomes in a cohort of injury patients. The overarching goal of this proposal is to reduce injury disparities, improve the survival rates and health of trauma patients, and advance equitable injury care. Results of this study will demonstrate that inclusion of health equity measures and longer-term tracking of outcomes allows for identification of important outcomes associated with health equity measures. This will inform creation of prevention and post-injury intervention efforts that will have sustained impact on the lives of vulnerable persons most at risk for injury and violence.

"Development of a Risk Factor Screen for Mental Health Problems after Sudden Illness or Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be debilitating and is related to impaired occupational and social functioning, chronic medical problems, disability, and increases in suicidality, violence, and criminal behavior. Over 10 million Americans are treated annually for sudden, severe illnesses or injuries that require very urgent treatment; and an estimated 20% of hospitalized traumatic injury patients have persisting mental health problems. Identifying those at risk for later disorder is difficult, and no screens can accurately predict PTSD in Americans exposed to traumatic stress. In research on adults exposed to traumatic injury, theory-driven pre- trauma, time-of-trauma, and post-trauma risk factors were strongly related to outcomes and accurately identified those who later had elevated PTSD symptoms. We propose to extend our work to a population level to create a screen for use in U.S. hospitals. In diverse populations of sudden illness or injury patients at hospitals sites in Baltimore, MD, Akron, OH, and Palo Alto, CA, data will be collected on theory-driven, highly predictive pre-trauma (gender, education, socioeconomic status, ethnicity/race, childhood home life and parental dysfunction, past trauma exposure); time-of-trauma (trauma intensity, pre-trauma home life; pre- trauma life stress), and post-trauma (acute PTSD and dissociation symptoms, negative thinking; post-trauma life stress; post-trauma social support; post-trauma social constraints) risk factors and later symptoms of disorder in 1,500 patients, including 1,100 (76%) ethnic/racial minorities. Data will also be collected on five variables found to relate to disparities in mental health or PTSD: discrimination/racism, competing needs, community cohesion, stigma, and negative expectations about treatment. Data collected will include sufficiently large samples of African American, Latino, Asians, and mixed ethnicity/race patients for separately analyses for these groups. Relationships of all predictors and disparities variables to outcomes and covariance among predictors and disparities variables will be examined to select risk factor and disparities variables that are highly predictive, similarly related to outcomes across subgroups, and can be measured with the fewest items and items that are briefer and less personal, stigmatizing, and difficult to understand. In Wave II of data collection, predictive performance will be assessed in a new sample of 1,500 patients, including 1,100 (76%) ethnic/racial minorities with a goal of identifying at least 80% (sensitivity) of those who later have high PTSD symptoms and at least 70% (specificity) of those who recover well. Project Narrative This project aims to develop and validate a practical and highly accurate screen to identify those at high risk for mental health problems following sudden serious illnesses or injuries and to insure that the screen performs well for those in ethnic/racial minority groups. Availability of an accurate screen will allow preventive care for those at high risk and could spur treatment development by allowing easy identification of those who could enroll in preventive and early intervention studies. Findings relating to disparities in risk factors and variables that influence responses to trauma differently for ethnic/racial minorities could be used to develop treatments targeted to these subgroups to reduce disparities in the emergence and severity of psychopathology and in mental health care after trauma exposure.",Development of a Risk Factor Screen for Mental Health Problems after Sudden Illness or Injury,9692020,R01MD012273,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Baltimore ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Sudden Death ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Medicine ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Natural Disasters ', ' Patients ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Sciences ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' terrorist attack ', ' Terrorism ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Dissociation ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' Injury ', ' criminal behavior ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Occupational ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohesion ', ' expectation ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Early intervention trials ', ' Social Functioning ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' rural disparities ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Life Stress ', ' Trauma ', ' Impairment ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' loved ones ', ' public health emergency ', ' screening ', ' Trauma patient ', ' traumatic event ', ' Traumatic injury ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' racial minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' acute symptom ', ' rurality ', ' rural dwellers ', ' rural resident ', ' rural counties ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' ']",NIMHD,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2019,636599,0.07265717981887085
"Pediatric Injury; Modules to Manage Medical Stress PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and associated psychological impairment affect from 25 to 57% of children after an injury and contribute to worse health related quality of life. Because children's PTSS emerge after they are discharged home from the hospital, they are often invisible to the trauma system and are neither detected nor treated. Although evidence-based treatment for PTSS exists, limited parental awareness and access to trained providers hinder community access. The goal of this project is to provide a research and treatment resource for the management of psychological distress in children who have been hospitalized for a physical trauma. In Aim 1, we will develop an innovative, brief e-health approach to treatment of PTSS designed to be delivered through the trauma system. We will create interactive web-based psychoeducational modules that are developmentally tailored for school age children (8 to 11 years) and youth (12 to 16 years) for use with synchronous e-health therapy sessions with a trained therapist. Modules will target two evidence based treatment methods: cognitive behavioral therapy coping skills (coping CBT) and direct exposure to trauma reminders through a trauma narrative. All modules will be piloted iteratively with parent, child, and expert practitioner input incorporated at each step. We will develop parent modules that accompany the child treatment programs that address parent concerns including managing their own stress, parenting skills and how to help children with a common injury-specific concern, sleep. Treatment resources will be designed specifically for ease of dissemination and incorporation into the trauma system. In Aim 2, we will perform a pilot three-armed RCT to examine the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the two brief treatments (coping CBT and trauma narrative) compared to an untreated comparison group (N = 54). Injured children and their families will be recruited to participate from the inpatient wards of the three participating sites. The treatment program will serve as a research resource for a subsequent large clinical trial designed to confirm efficacy and to examine potential treatment modifiers. To aid in dissemination of this treatment resource, we will create a webinar that provides training in the use of the manualized therapies and online modules. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children who develop psychological distress after being hospitalized for an injury often have difficulty accessing evidence-based treatment. This project will develop multimedia treatment modules that are tailored to the needs and developmental levels of children ages 8 to 16 years old with post- traumatic psychological distress that can be used on-line with therapist support.

"Building Research Capacity for Firearm Safety Among Children Among U.S. children, firearm-related fatalities are the 2nd leading cause of death and include the unintentional, accidental discharge of a firearm by a toddler with a playmate, the use of a firearm to self-inflict harm by a suicidal teen, and the escalation of bullying or dating violence to lethal means by an adolescent. Substantial disparities exist in firearm-related injuries, with African-American children disproportionally impacted by unintentional and assaultive firearm injury, and rural youth disproportionately dying of suicide by firearm. Childhood firearm injury rates have remained unchanged in the recent decades despite significant reductions in non-firearm fatal injuries due to an approach that includes improved epidemiologic data, behavior modifications, and technological solutions. In contrast, research funding and publications for firearm injury have lagged, leading to a current deficit of both established and developing researchers, as well as a lack of pilot work and literature needed to support large scale studies. A 2013 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report detailed the urgent need for novel and innovative research to address this deficit, however, was primarily focused on adult populations. This proposal builds on these IOM recommendations and utilizes multidisciplinary research expertise across the U.S., as well as stakeholder partner groups of gun owners, to catalyze the science of childhood firearm injury prevention with the overarching goal of reducing firearm injuries among children while also respecting gun ownership as an important part of the cultural fabric of US society. Our specific aims are: Aim #1: Create a multidisciplinary team of researchers and stakeholder partners to define a pediatric-specific firearm injury research agenda for the five workgroups; Aim #2: Stimulate novel firearm prevention research by having workgroups conduct pilot studies that address key research questions identified in Aim 1, to provide preliminary data that informs large-scale studies; Aim #3: Improve access to and use of national firearm data and ease future secondary analyses by: 1) Establishing a web-based searchable data archive for childhood firearm injury that is enabled with variable-level searching and cross-study comparisons; and, 2) Enhancing and improving pediatric firearm injury data collection in existing pediatric datasets such as the PECARN core data project and the PECARN registry database; Aim #4: Build a cadre of national research scholars with multidisciplinary training and expertise that will serve as an emerging pipeline for future research. Expected outcomes of this five-year grant will be to create six research resources: 1) consensus documents detailing the state of the science and key research questions for pediatric firearm injury prevention; 2) pilot data to support five large-scale research proposals; 3) a web-based data archive and searchable research repository on childhood firearm injury; 4) enhanced data collection opportunities on childhood firearm injuries through existing national networks (e.g., PECARN); 5) a cadre of new researchers (postdoctoral students) focused in this research area; and 6) a webinar series to inform researchers nationally in this topic area. PROJECT NARRATIVE Among U.S. children, firearm-related fatalities are the 2nd leading cause of death. Our proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of researchers and community stakeholder groups (gun advocates, gun safety trainers, veterans, family groups) across the U.S. to inform and catalyze the science of childhood firearm injury prevention by addressing both the gaps in research and human resources. The overarching goal of the project is to reduce the number of firearm injuries occurring among children.

"VALES+Tú: Targeting psychosocial stressors to reduce Latino Day Laborers injury disparities VALES+Tú: Targeting Psychosocial Stressors to Reduce Latino Day Laborers Injury Disparities Even as the safety of US workers continues to improve overall, the safety of Latino workers, especially day laborers, continues to deteriorate. Latino day laborers (LDL) are predominantly Spanish monolingual immigrant workers who experience multiple psychosocial stressors, including situational and immigration stress that amplify their risk for injury at work. LDL look for work at informal hiring sites or “corners” where they get hired intermittently to do a variety of entry-level jobs whose shifting conditions expose them to multiple safety hazards. The most alarming consequence of this constant rotation across unpredictable, dangerous jobs is the high rate of job-related fatalities in this population. Despite the urgent need, there are no effective and rigorously tested safety programs, portable to the corner where LDL wait for work, to help them cope with stressors that increase their risk for workplace injury. Our project's main goal is to address this question: Can a corner-based safety program addressing the psycho social stressors confronted by LDL reduce their reported exposure to hazardous conditions at work? Our proposed project, VALES+Tú (You are worth/worthy of more) is a 5 year community-based participatory program developed in partnership with Latino day laborers whose pilot results provide evidence of increasing risk reduction practices and reducing hazardous exposures at work. We are proposing to implement a multilevel intervention delivered in Spanish by LDL promotores to their peers at the corners and to test the program's effectiveness in a cluster randomized trial. The central aims of the project are: (1) to determine the efficacy of VALES+Tú in reducing hazardous exposures at work, and (2) to determine the mediating effect of psychosocial stressors on the primary outcomes of VALES+Tú. All project activities will be done in collaboration with our community partner, the Fe y Justicia (Faith and Justice) Worker Center, and with guidance from our Community Advisory Board . The short-term goal of VALES+Tú is to reduce LDL workplace hazards by involving them in a corner-based safety program that effectively addresses seldom targeted situational and immigration stress that increase risky practices at work. Our long-term goal is to reduce the high injury rates among Latino day laborers. Mitigating safety risks among LDL is an urgent public health priority that can be addressed by taking effective, low-cost, preventive action. The purpose of the Vales+Tú study is to implement and evaluate an injury prevention program among Latino day laborers (LDL) in Houston who are at a high risk of experiencing an injury at work. Our main objective is to answer this question: Can a corner-based safety program addressing the psychosocial stressors confronted by LDL reduce their exposure to hazardous conditions at work? In partnership with our Community Advisory Board, we will answer this question by testing the efficacy of the program in a group randomized trial to be conducted at local day labor corners. Our short term goal is to determine if we can reduce hazardous work exposures and our long term goal is to reduce LDL injuries at work.

"An injury plausibility assessment model for differentiating abusive from accidental fractures in young children PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Child abuse is a public health epidemic with devastating consequences for young children. In 2017, there were 676,000 victims of child abuse and neglect in the United States including approximately 1700 deaths. Young children are especially vulnerable - 81% of these deaths occurred among children 0-3 years old. Physical child abuse results in over 120,000 cases a year (less than a quarter of all abuse cases), but accounts for over half of the deaths, speaking to the heightened risk for a child. Fractures are the most common serious injury from physical abuse, occurring more often than abuse-related traumatic brain injury and abdominal injury combined. Each year in the United States there are more than 90,000 emergency department visits for fractures in children age 0-5 years (most often involving the long bones), with abuse-related fractures peaking in the first 3 years of life. It can be extremely difficult for providers to differentiate abuse-related fractures from those associated with an accident in these young children. This difficulty results in a bidirectional problem: under evaluation and missed abuse for some (which may result in re-injury or even death), and over evaluation for abuse and reporting to state child protective services (CPS) for others (which also impacts families negatively, and occurs most often in race/ethnic minority groups). Such “bidirectional” errors in decision making come at a high cost to all involved. These issues highlight the critical need for an evidence-based fracture assessment model to inform medical decision-making when attempting to differentiate abusive from accidental fractures. To address this need, we developed and tested a fracture injury plausibility assessment model (FxIPAM) in 201 children with long bone fractures. We demonstrated its capability to differentiate abuse-related fractures from those resulting from accidental trauma and also demonstrated its theoretical potential to decrease race/ethnic disparities in rates of abuse evaluations, based on model scoring results. Before implementation, validation is required. The goal of this study is to validate an evidence-based model for fracture assessments to improve the clinician’s ability to differentiate abuse from accidental fractures in young children. Therefore, we propose the following aims in a prospective multicenter study of 1000 children, 0-3 years of age, with a long bone fracture: 1) Validate our FxIPAM model by determining its predictive accuracy to differentiate between abuse vs. accidental long bone fractures, and 2) estimate the impact of a hypothetical application of the FxIPAM on abuse assessments and reporting to CPS across race/ethnic groups. Success of this study will result in the first validated model for fracture assessments in young children. The intent of the FxIPAM is not to diagnose abuse but to function as a screening tool to identify children at risk for abuse who require further evaluation and to identify children with plausible injuries where further work for abuse or reporting to CPS may not be require. The potential public health impact of this model is bidirectional: decreased missed abuse and decreased disparities in abuse evaluations and reporting to CPS. PROJECT NARRATIVE The multidisciplinary involvement of experts in the fields of child abuse, emergency medicine, social work, bone health, orthopaedic surgery, pediatric musculoskeletal radiology, biomechanics, and biostatistics will lead to a validated fracture injury plausibility assessment model. This model will improve accuracy in clinical decision-making by differentiating abusive from accidental injury. Ultimately, this may lead to fewer cases of missed abuse and fewer cases of over-evaluations for abuse and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in abuse assessments and reporting to child protective services.",An injury plausibility assessment model for differentiating abusive from accidental fractures in young children,10033417,R01HD102428,"['Abdominal Injuries ', ' Accidents ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Biomechanics ', ' biomechanical ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Bone Diseases ', ' bone disorder ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Abuse ', ' Childhood Abuse ', ' Consultations ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Osteogenesis Imperfecta ', ' Brittle bone disorder ', ' Fragilitas Ossium ', ' Osteogenesis Imperfect ', ' brittle bone disease ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Radiology Specialty ', ' General Radiology ', ' Radiology ', ' Reference Standards ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rickets ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Unintentional Injury ', ' Accidental Injury ', ' Orthopedic Surgery ', ' Orthopedic Surgery procedures ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' SKELSURV ', ' Skeletal Survey ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' long bone ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' child physical abuse ', ' Evaluation Reports ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Multi-center studies ', ' Multicenter Studies ', ' Abuse Reporting ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' Occult Fractures ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' care seeking ', ' child protection services ', ' child protective service ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Brain Trauma ', ' traumatic brain damage ', ' Traumatic Brain Injury ', ' Skin ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Childhood maltreatment ', ' child maltreatment ', ' Child Abuse and Neglect ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Validation ', ' physical maltreatment ', ' physical abuse ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' bone health ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' 3 years of age ', ' age 3 years ', ' three year old ', ' three years of age ', ' 3 year old ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ']",NICHD,LURIE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF CHICAGO,R01,2020,724840,0.048612265867895875
"UAW Hazardous Material Worker Health and Safety Training (U45) Program Summary/Abstract  The International Union, UAW proposes to train 2339 workers in the first year, providing 22,545 contact hours of training using 25 different curricula at worksites and at union-sponsored functions. The UAW will train 11,695 participants and provide 112,725 contact hours of training over the life of the project. We will expand the scope of an on-going program which provides training in hazardous waste operations, hazardous materials transportation, environmental restoration of contaminated site, emergency response and related health and safety topics. The long-term objective of this project is to prevent work-related harm by providing health and safety training to UAW members and members of communities disadvantaged by environmental injustice, limited English proficiency and/or lack of educational opportunity. The training will help them to protect themselves, their places of employment and their communities from exposure to hazardous materials. A special strength of this project is that it integrates the technical expertise of the UAW and the University of Michigan (U-M) in basic disciplines of health and safety, the practical experience of the UAW in addressing hazards at work, and the ongoing relationship of the UAW with trainees and management at worksites served. We plan to enhance collaboration with groups that serve populations with limited English proficiency, occupational health disparities and environmental justice challenges. To do so, we propose not just to deliver health and safety training to community members recruited by our partner organizations, but also to transfer health and safety training skills to the staffs of our partner organizations through train-the-trainer programs. Our partner organizations include:  - Catholic Charities Hispanic Outreach Services  - United Hispanic Workers of Detroit  - Macomb International Services Center  - Detroiters Working for Environmental Justice  - Green Door Initiative  - OAI Inc  The paramount goal of this project is to prevent work-related harm by training UAW members and others in how best to protect themselves and their communities from exposure to hazardous materials encountered during hazardous waste operations, hazardous materials transportation, environmental restoration of contaminated facilities and/or chemical emergency response. The specific aims are to:  1. Conduct training in health and safety topics directly or indirectly related to elimination  and/or reduction of potential exposure to hazardous materials.  2. Develop new curricula on chemical safety and security, climate change, Ebola and other  topics. Revise and expand existing curricula as needed. Integrate advanced training  technology into new and revised curricula to improve the delivery of training (WETP  Mission Priority 5).  3. Continue and intensify efforts to identify and target high-risk worksites for delivery of training.  4. Continue and expand collaborative partnerships with community groups and other  NIEHS-WETP grantees. These partnerships will be particularly focused on addressing  underserved workers, health disparities and environmental justice.  5. Conduct program evaluation, integrating use of worker-evaluators to provide feedback for  continual improvement of curricula and delivery methods. This will include evaluating the  long-term impact of IER training on worker and organizational outcomes.  6. Continue and expand a study that identifies factors contributing to suboptimal safety  cultures and assesses the effectiveness of low cost intervention strategies to positively  change suboptimal workplace safety cultures. Project Narrative The International Union, UAW proposes to expand the scope of an on-going program whose long-term objective is to prevent the adverse consequences of exposure to hazardous materials by providing health and safety training to UAW members and members of communities disadvantaged by environmental injustice, limited English proficiency and/or lack of educational opportunity. We propose not just to deliver health and safety training to community members recruited by our partner organizations, but also to transfer health and safety training skills to the staffs of our partner organizations through train-the-trainer programs. Our membership is national in scope and we have a track record of more than thirty years of competence and experience in delivering this kind of training. The major problem we address is the potential for illness and injury associated with contact with hazardous materials. More specifically, we seek to address emerging hazards (NIEHS Strategic Plan, Goal 5), environmental health disparities (NIEHS Strategic Plan Goal 6), and lack of opportunity for underserved populations (WETP Strategic Plan Mission Priority 4).

"Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as the leading cause of death and disability in all parts of the world and costs the international economy approximately US$400 billion annually, which, given an estimated standardized gross world product of US $73.7 trillion, is a striking 0.5% of the entire annual global output. To address the profound issues related to a drastic increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for TBI over the past decades, the United States Congress highlighted injury surveillance as a federal priority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines surveillance as “use of health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response”. To prevent TBI, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns, in addition to having strong knowledge of clinical disorders, characteristic, or other definable entity, that differentiates TBI from other clinical populations. A critical barrier to the progress of the NIH-funded program “Comorbidity in traumatic brain injury and risk of all-cause mortality, functional and financial burden: a decade-long population based cohort study” was the presence of complex and multifaceted comorbidities in a patient with TBI before and at the time of the injury, and their links to patients’ frailty, injury circumstances, severity, and outcomes. This resulted in a shift in the research paradigm, and development of a novel data mining approach used in genomics to sequence more than 70,000 clinical diagnosis codes in a TBI population, and compare them to a matched population. The developed data mining approach allowed not only the validation of previously known risk factors of TBI, but also the identification of associations previously unknown, without any preconceived human biases. This project will continue advancement of a non-hypothesis driven scientific approach, which will: (1) Characterize patients with TBI at three different time periods in relation to the TBI event – before, at the time of, and after the injury; (2) Develop individual and population level models to study the transitions between the different time states; and (3) Construct and validate predictive models of susceptibility to TBI events, adverse outcomes, and high healthcare resource use at the individual and population level. Decades- long population-based health administrative data from the publicly-funded healthcare system in Ontario, Canada is ready to be further analysed for clinical and technological advancement, to support human thinking in categorizing personal, clinical, and environmental exposure data preceding TBI. Project Narrative To detect, manage, and prevent traumatic brain injury (TBI), a complex and often lifelong disabling injury, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns and have a comprehensive knowledge of the clinical disorder, characteristic, or other definable entity that differentiates between and within persons at risk of TBI of varying mechanisms, injury presentation, and its course. This research proposal expands an ongoing NIH-funded project that started to categorize clinical comorbidities and personal and environmental exposure data into clinically meaningful factors that increase the risk of injury and its severity at the population and individual levels. With the support of data mining and big data, this proposed program will advance research methods with a goal-directed learning process and the fields of injury surveillance and precision medicine, covering a variety of interests in public health, brain injury medicine, and behavioural and social sciences.",Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain

"Achieving Injury-related Health Equity in the National Trauma Healthcare System ABSTRACT The consequences of injuries and violence disproportionately impact persons of color, uninsured individuals, those with limited English proficiency, and those who are geographically isolated. Injuries are the leading cause of death and disability for those aged 1-44 years in the US, and each year 2.5 million individuals are hospitalized and 26.9 million are treated in the Emergency Department as a result of injuries. Total lifetime medical and work loss costs associated with injuries are estimated at $671 billion/year. Existing state-level trauma registry systems currently collect data on injuries, injury care, and patient characteristics and contribute these data to the national trauma databank and the Trauma Quality Improvement Program of the American College of Surgeons. However, there are significant limitations in the current trauma registry systems. Data are not collected on equity-related factors beyond race, such as primary language spoken or income or on longer- term outcomes after hospital discharge. Our group conducted a national Delphi process with key experts to identify a national agenda in injury and health equity. Key priorities included: 1) Inclusion of health equity- related measures in trauma registries and 2) Need for longer-term follow up of patients to examine how local practices and system factors affect the health of injured patients over time and lead to outcome disparities. Systematically accounting for care factors and outcomes by health-equity measures is a critical step towards developing system-level interventions to alleviate health disparities. This study aims to address these priorities within our Trauma Registry system by developing and testing the feasibility of a culturally sensitive data collection instrument and process that can be included in the existing trauma registry systems to capture health equity measures and longer-term outcomes for diverse trauma patients. We will also examine the relationship between health equity measures and longer-term outcomes in a cohort of injury patients. The overarching goal of this proposal is to reduce injury disparities, improve the survival rates and health of trauma patients, and advance equitable injury care. Results of this study will demonstrate that inclusion of health equity measures and longer-term tracking of outcomes allows for identification of important outcomes associated with health equity measures. This will inform creation of prevention and post-injury intervention efforts that will have sustained impact on the lives of vulnerable persons most at risk for injury and violence. Project Narrative Injuries disproportionately impact persons of color, uninsured individuals, those with limited English proficiency, and those who are geographically isolated; critical gaps in our current healthcare data collection systems prohibit identification of successful and large-scale prevention and intervention targets to address disparities. This study aims to address these limitations by incorporating into our existing system a culturally sensitive data collection instrument and process for assessing health equity measures and longer-term outcomes for injury patients.

"UAW Hazardous Material Worker Health and Safety Training (U45) Program Summary/Abstract  The International Union, UAW and its partners propose to address three problems. The first is the potential for illness and injury directly or indirectly related to hazardous material exposure. The second is occupational and environmental health disparities, particularly as they affect the Hispanic/Latino population of Southeast Michigan. The third problem is the opioid epidemic, an emerging environmental health issue.  To address the first problem, we will continue development of an ongoing program whose paramount goal is to prevent illnesses and injuries by providing training on health and safety topics that are directly or indirectly related to elimination and/or reduction of potential exposure to hazardous materials. UAW members throughout the United States are exposed to a wide variety of hazards. Manufacturing workers can face exposure to carcinogens, such as welding fume and hexavalent chromium and emerging hazards, such as engineered nanomaterials (ENM). Members employed in casinos are often heavily exposed to carcinogenic tobacco smoke. In healthcare and academic labs, union members can be exposed to bloodborne pathogens, sterilants, radioactive isotopes and/or emerging hazards, such as ENM. The UAW has established a partnership with the University of Puerto Rico to provide training to the union’s six thousand active members on the island who are still dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.  The second problem is occupational and environmental health disparities in Southeast Michigan, where the Hispanic/Latino population includes many who are disadvantaged by environmental injustice, less formal education, limited English proficiency, and/or limited access to training. The UAW is working with two partners who serve the Hispanic/Latino communities in Southeast Michigan, Catholic Charities of Southeast Michigan – Hispanic Outreach Services (CCSEM/HOS) and La Casa Guadalupana. Many in these populations are exposed to pesticides when doing landscaping or agricultural work, silica and other dust when working in construction and/or toxic cleaning solvents when working in housekeeping or childcare. Some work outdoors, where they are exposed to temperature extremes, UV radiation and/or air pollutants. They may work 6-7 days per week in jobs characterized by seasonal instability, shifting hours, low pay and physically harmful or dangerous work conditions.  The third problem is the opioid crisis, which has affected many UAW members, especially in manufacturing.  In the first year of the grant, the UAW and its partners together propose to train 2,661 participants in 163 programs for a total of 20,442 contact hours. The five-year totals would be 13,305 participants in 815 programs for a total of 102,210 contact hours. The consortium proposes to address the potential for illness and injury directly or indirectly related to hazardous material exposure by conducting training in health and safety. We will address occupational and environmental health disparities by continuing and expanding collaborative partnerships with community groups and other NIEHS-WTP grantees for the purpose of delivering health and safety training to underserved populations. The opioid crisis will be addressed by developing and delivering population-specific curricula that address treatment and prevention of opioid addiction, including alternatives for pain management. In addition, we propose to develop, pilot, evaluate, and scale a peer recovery support program that will help workers seek services to address opioid addiction.  All of the above programs will be evaluated to provide feedback for continual improvement of curricula and delivery methods. This will include monitoring trainee perceptions of quality, appropriateness, and usefulness as well as assessing new curricula and training delivery methods; evaluating the long-term impact of training on worker and organizational outcomes using innovative and conventional quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods. Worker- evaluators will be incorporated into evaluation when possible. Project Narrative  The International Union, UAW and its partners propose to address three problems.

"Building Research Capacity for Firearm Safety Among Children Among U.S. children, firearm-related fatalities are the 2nd leading cause of death and include the unintentional, accidental discharge of a firearm by a toddler with a playmate, the use of a firearm to self-inflict harm by a suicidal teen, and the escalation of bullying or dating violence to lethal means by an adolescent. Substantial disparities exist in firearm-related injuries, with African-American children disproportionally impacted by unintentional and assaultive firearm injury, and rural youth disproportionately dying of suicide by firearm. Childhood firearm injury rates have remained unchanged in the recent decades despite significant reductions in non-firearm fatal injuries due to an approach that includes improved epidemiologic data, behavior modifications, and technological solutions. In contrast, research funding and publications for firearm injury have lagged, leading to a current deficit of both established and developing researchers, as well as a lack of pilot work and literature needed to support large scale studies. A 2013 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report detailed the urgent need for novel and innovative research to address this deficit, however, was primarily focused on adult populations. This proposal builds on these IOM recommendations and utilizes multidisciplinary research expertise across the U.S., as well as stakeholder partner groups of gun owners, to catalyze the science of childhood firearm injury prevention with the overarching goal of reducing firearm injuries among children while also respecting gun ownership as an important part of the cultural fabric of US society. Our specific aims are: Aim #1: Create a multidisciplinary team of researchers and stakeholder partners to define a pediatric-specific firearm injury research agenda for the five workgroups; Aim #2: Stimulate novel firearm prevention research by having workgroups conduct pilot studies that address key research questions identified in Aim 1, to provide preliminary data that informs large-scale studies; Aim #3: Improve access to and use of national firearm data and ease future secondary analyses by: 1) Establishing a web-based searchable data archive for childhood firearm injury that is enabled with variable-level searching and cross-study comparisons; and, 2) Enhancing and improving pediatric firearm injury data collection in existing pediatric datasets such as the PECARN core data project and the PECARN registry database; Aim #4: Build a cadre of national research scholars with multidisciplinary training and expertise that will serve as an emerging pipeline for future research. Expected outcomes of this five-year grant will be to create six research resources: 1) consensus documents detailing the state of the science and key research questions for pediatric firearm injury prevention; 2) pilot data to support five large-scale research proposals; 3) a web-based data archive and searchable research repository on childhood firearm injury; 4) enhanced data collection opportunities on childhood firearm injuries through existing national networks (e.g., PECARN); 5) a cadre of new researchers (postdoctoral students) focused in this research area; and 6) a webinar series to inform researchers nationally in this topic area. PROJECT NARRATIVE Among U.S. children, firearm-related fatalities are the 2nd leading cause of death. Our proposal brings together a multidisciplinary team of researchers and community stakeholder groups (gun advocates, gun safety trainers, veterans, family groups) across the U.S. to inform and catalyze the science of childhood firearm injury prevention by addressing both the gaps in research and human resources. The overarching goal of the project is to reduce the number of firearm injuries occurring among children.

"Tiny Cargo, Big Deal! An Adaptive ED-Based eHealth Intervention to Promote Correct and Consistent Size-Appropriate Child Passenger Safety Behaviors and Reduce Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY Motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) remain the leading cause of unintentional injury deaths among children in the United States (U.S.) and racial/ethnic minority children are disproportionately impacted as suboptimal child passenger safety behaviors are more prevalent in some communities. Existing universal approaches to promote child passenger safety have fallen short of ensuring that all child passengers are correctly using size- appropriate child passenger restraints according to guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Precision prevention programs are urgently needed to improve child passenger safety behaviors among caregivers who have not been responsive to guidelines, laws, and public education campaigns. The proposed research will test the efficacy of Tiny Cargo, Big Deal (TCBD), an emergency department (ED)-based precision prevention intervention grounded in Self- Determination Theory. TCBD integrates personalized counseling based on principles of motivational interviewing (MI) and eHealth components including a tailored educational web application (app) and short message service (SMS) communications with the goal of improving child passenger safety. We hypothesize that by providing tailored child passenger safety education and personalized skills for restraint use in a manner that supports autonomous motivation the TCBD intervention will be more efficacious than universal approaches (laws/guidelines) for realizing correct use of size-appropriate child passenger restraints. The primary outcomes, size-appropriate restraint use and the Child Passenger Safety Score (CPaSS), will be assessed with direct observation at scheduled, in-person appointments and remote observation of digital photographs submitted by caregivers in response to unscheduled text messages. We will test our hypothesis using a randomized adaptive trial design with the following aims: Aim 1: To refine and verify the reliability of elements in the 100-point CPaSS, a novel composite measure of child passenger safety. Aim 2: To test the efficacy of the TCBD intervention compared to usual care for improving primary outcomes [i.e., size- appropriate restraint (dichotomous) and CPaSS-D (numeric)] at 6 and 12 months. Aim 3: To use latent growth curve models to identify characteristic trajectories for the CPaSS-R observed in digital photographs over the 12 study months and assess for correlates of the trajectory types. This innovative, theoretically grounded research will have long-standing impact on child passenger safety by informing the best methods to increase correct use of size-appropriate child restraint systems among caregivers of diverse backgrounds at the point they interact with the health care system. The work has the potential for wide-scale implementation in the ED and for translation to primary care offices, schools, and community settings with an ultimate goal of eliminating child passenger safety disparities and reducing the number of childhood injuries from MVCs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Injuries sustained by young children in motor vehicle crashes are a significant and costly public health concern. The correct and consistent use of a size-appropriate child passenger restraint can mitigate the risk of injury for children younger than 11 who are involved in a crash. The proposed Tiny Cargo, Big Deal precision prevention intervention is grounded in Self-Determination Theory and uses successful strategies for behavior change, including counseling based on principles of motivational interviewing and tailored eHealth communications. The overarching goal is to improve child passenger safety behaviors among diverse caregivers of children recommended to use a car seat or booster seat who contact the health system through the emergency department.","Tiny Cargo, Big Deal!

"Pediatric Injury; Modules to Manage Medical Stress PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and associated psychological impairment affect from 25 to 57% of children after an injury and contribute to worse health related quality of life. Because children's PTSS emerge after they are discharged home from the hospital, they are often invisible to the trauma system and are neither detected nor treated. Although evidence-based treatment for PTSS exists, limited parental awareness and access to trained providers hinder community access. The goal of this project is to provide a research and treatment resource for the management of psychological distress in children who have been hospitalized for a physical trauma. In Aim 1, we will develop an innovative, brief e-health approach to treatment of PTSS designed to be delivered through the trauma system. We will create interactive web-based psychoeducational modules that are developmentally tailored for school age children (8 to 11 years) and youth (12 to 16 years) for use with synchronous e-health therapy sessions with a trained therapist. Modules will target two evidence based treatment methods: cognitive behavioral therapy coping skills (coping CBT) and direct exposure to trauma reminders through a trauma narrative. All modules will be piloted iteratively with parent, child, and expert practitioner input incorporated at each step. We will develop parent modules that accompany the child treatment programs that address parent concerns including managing their own stress, parenting skills and how to help children with a common injury-specific concern, sleep. Treatment resources will be designed specifically for ease of dissemination and incorporation into the trauma system. In Aim 2, we will perform a pilot three-armed RCT to examine the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the two brief treatments (coping CBT and trauma narrative) compared to an untreated comparison group (N = 54). Injured children and their families will be recruited to participate from the inpatient wards of the three participating sites. The treatment program will serve as a research resource for a subsequent large clinical trial designed to confirm efficacy and to examine potential treatment modifiers. To aid in dissemination of this treatment resource, we will create a webinar that provides training in the use of the manualized therapies and online modules. PROJECT NARRATIVE Children who develop psychological distress after being hospitalized for an injury often have difficulty accessing evidence-based treatment. This project will develop multimedia treatment modules that are tailored to the needs and developmental levels of children ages 8 to 16 years old with post- traumatic psychological distress that can be used on-line with therapist support.

"Development of a Risk Factor Screen for Mental Health Problems after Sudden Illness or Injury PROJECT SUMMARY Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be debilitating and is related to impaired occupational and social functioning, chronic medical problems, disability, and increases in suicidality, violence, and criminal behavior. Over 10 million Americans are treated annually for sudden, severe illnesses or injuries that require very urgent treatment; and an estimated 20% of hospitalized traumatic injury patients have persisting mental health problems. Identifying those at risk for later disorder is difficult, and no screens can accurately predict PTSD in Americans exposed to traumatic stress. In research on adults exposed to traumatic injury, theory-driven pre- trauma, time-of-trauma, and post-trauma risk factors were strongly related to outcomes and accurately identified those who later had elevated PTSD symptoms. We propose to extend our work to a population level to create a screen for use in U.S. hospitals. In diverse populations of sudden illness or injury patients at hospitals sites in Baltimore, MD, Akron, OH, and Palo Alto, CA, data will be collected on theory-driven, highly predictive pre-trauma (gender, education, socioeconomic status, ethnicity/race, childhood home life and parental dysfunction, past trauma exposure); time-of-trauma (trauma intensity, pre-trauma home life; pre- trauma life stress), and post-trauma (acute PTSD and dissociation symptoms, negative thinking; post-trauma life stress; post-trauma social support; post-trauma social constraints) risk factors and later symptoms of disorder in 1,500 patients, including 1,100 (76%) ethnic/racial minorities. Data will also be collected on five variables found to relate to disparities in mental health or PTSD: discrimination/racism, competing needs, community cohesion, stigma, and negative expectations about treatment. Data collected will include sufficiently large samples of African American, Latino, Asians, and mixed ethnicity/race patients for separately analyses for these groups. Relationships of all predictors and disparities variables to outcomes and covariance among predictors and disparities variables will be examined to select risk factor and disparities variables that are highly predictive, similarly related to outcomes across subgroups, and can be measured with the fewest items and items that are briefer and less personal, stigmatizing, and difficult to understand. In Wave II of data collection, predictive performance will be assessed in a new sample of 1,500 patients, including 1,100 (76%) ethnic/racial minorities with a goal of identifying at least 80% (sensitivity) of those who later have high PTSD symptoms and at least 70% (specificity) of those who recover well. Project Narrative This project aims to develop and validate a practical and highly accurate screen to identify those at high risk for mental health problems following sudden serious illnesses or injuries and to insure that the screen performs well for those in ethnic/racial minority groups. Availability of an accurate screen will allow preventive care for those at high risk and could spur treatment development by allowing easy identification of those who could enroll in preventive and early intervention studies. Findings relating to disparities in risk factors and variables that influence responses to trauma differently for ethnic/racial minorities could be used to develop treatments targeted to these subgroups to reduce disparities in the emergence and severity of psychopathology and in mental health care after trauma exposure.",Development of a Risk Factor Screen for Mental Health Problems after Sudden Illness or Injury,9899113,R01MD012273,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Baltimore ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Sudden Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Emergency Medicine ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Medicine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Natural Disasters ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Specificity ', ' statistics ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Terrorism ', ' terrorist attack ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Dissociation ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' criminal behavior ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Occupational ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' cohesion ', ' expectation ', ' social ', ' acute posttraumatic stress disorder ', ' Acute Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Early intervention trials ', ' Social Functioning ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' rural disparities ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Life Stress ', ' Trauma ', ' Impairment ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' loved ones ', ' public health emergency ', ' screening ', ' Trauma patient ', ' traumatic event ', ' Traumatic injury ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' acute symptom ', ' rurality ', ' rural resident ', ' rural dwellers ', ' rural counties ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' trauma exposure ', ' traumatic stress ', ' posttrauma ', ' post-trauma ', ' ']",NIMHD,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2020,610092,0.07265717981887085
"Hired Latino Youth Farmworkers: Work Organization, Safety, Hazards, and Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Agriculture is a unique industry in the United States in the manner in which youth can be involved. Youth as young as 14 years of age can be employed to do farm work without parental consent, and youth as young as 10 years can be employed to do farm work with parental consent. Youth employed in agriculture can work with sharp tools, machinery, and pesticides, as well as do the strenuous tasks of planting, cultivating and harvesting crops, and working with large animals. The rates of injuries and illness among youth agricultural workers are extremely high. The safety and health of hired youth migrant and seasonal farmworkers are seldom considered in analyses of child agricultural injuries. Hired youth farmworkers are part of the larger vulnerable immigrant farmworker community, and include children in seasonal farmworker families, those in migrant families, and unaccompanied youth. Migrant and seasonal farmworkers are a vulnerable population that experiences significant health disparities; the experiences of youth hired Latino farmworkers, which includes harassment and abuse, places them at even greater risk. However, little research has documented the safety and health of youth hired Latino farmworkers. This project is based on a community-based participatory research collaboration between community advocates, youth, and academic investigators. Focused on youth farmworkers aged 10 to 15 years, it will use a mixed-methods approach that combines qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with longitudinal statistical data from detailed interviews, clinical examinations, and biomarkers to address 3 specific aims: (1) describe the common work experiences of hired Latino youth farmworkers, including why and when they work, the tasks they perform, their training and supervision, their working conditions, the benefits and hazards they perceive are associated with work, and how they believe farm work influences their health; (2) delineate (a) the personal and developmental characteristics, work characteristics, work organization, and work safety culture of hired Latino youth farmworkers; (b) the work related occupational, environmental, and social hazards they experience; and (c) their behavioral, psychological, and physical health characteristics; and (3) determine the (a) associations of work characteristics and hazards of hired Latino youth farmworkers with their health characteristics; and (b) how the associations of work characteristics and hazards with health are affected by their work organization, safety culture, and developmental characteristics. This project is significant and innovative because it will provide longitudinal data on the occupational hazards experienced by hired youth farmworkers, and document the work organization and work safety culture in which they work. It examines how agricultural work and hazards affect immediate physical injury, but also how these factors influence the psychological and behavioral health of these children. This information will inform safety process and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hired youth farmworkers experience high rates of occupational injury. Data are needed delineate how work organization and safety culture are associated with hazards and health outcomes among these youth workers. This project uses a mixed-methods design and community-based participatory research approach to delineate the characteristics of hired youth farmworkers, their occupational hazards, and their work organization and safety culture characteristics.","Hired Latino Youth Farmworkers: Work Organization, Safety, Hazards, and Health",9629726,R01HD084420,"['Affect ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Animals ', ' assault ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Drowning ', ' Employment ', ' Family ', ' Fire - disasters ', ' Fires ', ' fire ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Housing ', ' Industry ', ' Interview ', ' literacy ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Pesticides ', ' Plants ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Siblings ', ' Supervision ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' falls ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Social Network ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Rural ', ' agriculture worker ', ' Agricultural Workers ', ' Policies ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' farmworker ', ' farm worker ', ' tool ', ' occupational hazard ', ' Hour ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Occupational ', ' Farm ', ' farm environment ', ' Farming environment ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' Parental Consent ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' behavioral health ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Fatality rate ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Harvest ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' injured ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' migration ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' 10 years of age ', ' age 10 years ', ' ten year old ', ' ten years of age ', ' 10 year old ', ' 14 years of age ', ' age 14 years ', ' fourteen year old ', ' fourteen years of age ', ' 14 year old ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' social science research ', ' job environment ', ' work atmosphere ', ' work environment ', ' workplace climate ', ' workplace environment ', ' professional atmosphere ', ' Fatal injury ', ' Occupational injury ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' Child Health ', ' Migrant ', ' clinical exam ', ' clinical examination ', ' ']",NICHD,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,598534,0.03663769723628733
"A NW Tribal EpiCenter Collaboration to Improve the Use of Motor Vehicle Injury Data Abstract American Indians and Alaska Natives(AI/AN) are disproportionately affected by motor vehicle injuries and fatalities. As sovereign nations, tribes are often responsible for policies, practices, and infrastructure improvements to address these problems. The Northwest Tribal Epidemiology Center (The EpiCenter) is tasked with responding to the data needs of the 43 NW Tribes, including motor vehicle injury related information. While The EpiCenter does provide state- specific AI/AN fatality data and hospital discharge injury data, tribes have repeatedly requested local injury data, as well as crash data to inform decision-making. We initiate this proposal in response to these requests and needs of the tribes. We plan to use race-corrected data sources we have in-house at the EpiCenter – death certificates, hospital discharge data and trauma registries – to evaluate the magnitude of the MV injury disparity and to report and map injury data to as local of level as possible. We will also utilize other data sources that are not race corrected, including Fatality Analysis Reporting System, and syndromic surveillance data (near real-time clinical data from Emergency Departments, urgent care facilities and other medical clinics) to illuminate injury severity and understand crash-related factors. We will undertake quality improvement of these data as necessary. We will complement these quantitative data with qualitative data to help us understand the context of the problem, identify where tribes need increased capacity, and to paint a more complete picture of AI/AN motor vehicle injuries and deaths. Because motor vehicle injuries fall under the scope of work of several different departments – planning, law enforcement, transportation, policy and health – information and the use of data can be disjointed. This proposal will bring together experts from these fields to respond to the data, identify and assist in quality improvement efforts, and ensure that analyses and reports are useful to decision-makers in various capacities. Project Narrative This project brings together multiple motor vehicle injury data sources and experts to inform Tribal EpiCenter efforts toward reducing the American Indian injury and death disparity. We will describe the motor vehicle injury distribution, disparity, and give tribes as local of data as possible. We will disseminate the data via reports and maps, and undertake data quality improvement efforts as needed.",A NW Tribal EpiCenter Collaboration to Improve the Use of Motor Vehicle Injury Data,9924285,R01MD013353,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Awareness ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Data Sources ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Death Certificates ', ' Decision Making ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Idaho ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Oregon ', ' Paint ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Registries ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Tribes ', ' Universities ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Washington ', ' Work ', ' Police ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Unintentional Injury ', ' Accidental Injury ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' Motor Vehicles ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' data quality ', ' Collaborations ', ' restraint ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' member ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' depository ', ' repository ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disease registry ', ' car accident injury ', ' car injury ', ' injury due to car accident ', ' injury from car accident ', ' injury from motor vehicle accident ', ' motor vehicle injury ', ' Address ', ' tribe health ', ' tribal health ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Resolution ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Evaluable ', ' Evaluable Disease ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' syndromic surveillance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' tribal community ', ' tribal board ', ' tribal organization ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' Tribal group ', ' Automobile collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' evidence base ', ' surveillance data ', ' urgent care ', ' ED visit ', ' ER visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' Emergency hospital visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' public health intervention ', ' health data ', ' injurious falls ', ' fall injury ', ' tribal lands ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWEST PORTLAND AREA INDIAN HLTH BD,R01,2020,456189,0.22545573699343294
