"Post-Baccalureate Research Education Program (PREP) The University of California, Irvine (UCI) is a top research institute that has gained national recognition for its Minority Science Programs at the School of Biological Sciences.  The Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) at UCI is new initiative to encourage and prepare minorities who hold a recent baccalaureate degree for a successful pursuit of a research doctorate.  PREP aims at increasing the number of qualified underrepresented minorities entering Ph.D. programs in biomedical sciences.  The program will start with a cohort of 6 scholars.  During the second year, the program will increase to a steady state group of 10 scholars per year. PREP will provide (1) paid research training as full-time apprentice scientists in a preceptor's faculty laboratory to gain research skills, in an employer-employee relationship, (2) individual academic plans to enhance scholar's preparedness, (3) quarterly academic advising, (4) GRE preparation, (5) monthly faculty seminars about research on health disparities presented by invited speakers and (6) training in scientific communications to prepare papers to be presented at scientific meetings.  These components serve as a mechanism to maintain interest in biomedical research after college graduation, receive compensation and prepare for a Ph.D. program, while scholars establish a mentor relation with a faculty advisor, gain advance research skills and become competitive applicants for graduate school.  PREP scholars will have individual academic plans based on recommendations made by the Admission Committee of the Combined Graduate Program offered by two departments in the School of Biological Sciences and four departments in the College of Medicine.  Faculty in the Combined Graduate Program utilize state-of-the-art approaches and provide training in eight areas of concentration, including cancer biology, virology, immunology and pathogenesis.  Over 100 faculty with funded research programs have agreed to serve as preceptors.  Progress made by scholars will be monitored by quarterly meetings to insure advances in their research training, academic plans, GRE preparation and application to the Ph.D. program.

"Emory's Biosciences Graduate Prep Program for Minoriti*  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overarching goal of this Emory University and Morehouse School of Medicine collaborative program is to serve as an incubator in which students will be (a) immersed in mentored research in NIH-funded labs; (b) exposed to formal and informal mechanisms to further develop communication and quantitative skills for the successful pursuit of a doctorate in the biomedical sciences; and (c) be informed the importance of biomedical research in eliminating health disparities in minority groups. To this end, PREP students will be given full access to resources made available through Emory University, Morehouse School of Medicine, the Center for Behavioral Neuroscience, and the Center for Science Education.   This program will predominantly target underrepresented minority students from HBCUs, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and Tribal Colleges and Universities nationwide. PREP students will engage in cutting-edge research in highly competitive laboratories of eminent scientists in the field of affective state disorders, diabetes, infectious disease, vascular diseases, and addiction. These scientists are committed to student training. In addition to research, students will be expected to participate in laboratory activities including seminars and weekly laboratory meetings; to attend GDBBS departmental journal clubs and evening lectures; to enroll in a bridge course Demystifying Biomedical Research, Values in Science Ethics course and no more than one graduate-level course per semester; to enroll in a GRE preparatory course and a statistical analysis; and, finally, to participate in a monthly Minority Health Disparities Symposium. In addition, students will be expected to apply to graduate programs during their tenure in the program. Near the end of the post-baccalaureate experience, students will prepare a poster and a journal chronicling their progress throughout the program and defining the focus and findings of their research. The overall PROMISE experience will (a) afford student a network of science scholars who will provide a wealth of advice pre-and post-PhD and (b) equip students with the skills to not only succeed- but excel in top-ranked graduate programs in the biomedical sciences.

"MU PREP Scholars program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The University of Missouri-Columbia (MU) will identify and provide financial support and training for a total of 20 prospective underrepresented minority researchers, at a steady state of 10/year, to prepare them to successfully pursue a research doctorate in a biomedically-relevant discipline at MU, or at any other research institution. The MU/NIH PREP Scholars program will strengthen the research, academic, and personal communication skills of talented and promising minority baccalaureate graduates who elected or were forced by circumstance to postpone graduate school. We will prepare our PREP Scholars for entrance into and successful completion of PhD programs leading to research careers, especially in areas that address health disparities in minority populations.     This project complements and will be carefully coordinated with MU'S current high school, undergraduate and graduate programs for underrepresented minority scholars, thereby advancing our comprehensive effort to increase the minority research scholar talent pool in the biomedical sciences. In this proposal we present a coordinated, intrusive plan to help underrepresented minorities make a successful transition to a doctoral graduate program by immersing each of them in a faculty research program and providing a coordinated academic, financial and personal support system. Those PREP Scholars Program participants who elect to remain at MU for their doctoral work will begin their doctoral program with advanced research skills, with a faculty and peer mentoring system already in place, with connections to departments and active membership in a smaller academic community, and with lasting friendships with other graduate students in the life sciences.

PREP will provide (1) paid research training as full-time apprentice scientists in a preceptor's faculty laboratory to gain research skills, in an employer-employee relationship, (2) individual academic plans to enhance scholar's preparedness, (3) quarterly academic advising, (4) GRE preparation, (5) monthly faculty seminars about research on health disparities presented by invited speakers and (6) training in scientific communications to prepare papers to be presented at scientific meetings.  These components serve as a mechanism to maintain interest in biomedical research after college graduation, receive compensation and prepare for a Ph.D. program, while scholars establish a mentor relation with a faculty advisor, gain advance research skills and become competitive applicants for graduate school.  PREP scholars will have individual academic plans based on recommendations made by the Admission Committee of the Combined Graduate Program offered by two departments in the School of Biological Sciences and four departments in the College of Medicine.  Faculty in the Combined Graduate Program utilize state-of-the-art approaches and provide training in eight areas of concentration, including cancer biology, virology, immunology and pathogenesis.  Over 100 faculty with funded research programs have agreed to serve as preceptors.  Progress made by scholars will be monitored by quarterly meetings to insure advances in their research training, academic plans, GRE preparation and application to the Ph.D. program.

"Cal State LA Biomedical PREP    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  California State University Los Angeles (Cal State LA), a minority institution offering the MS as its highest degree, and with a long tradition of success in developing the careers of minority Americans in the biomedical sciences, proposes to renew its successful Biomedical Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (BIOMED PREP). The proposed and expanded program seeks to keep in the biomedical human capital pipeline the talents of capable minority individuals whose abilities might otherwise be lost to biomedical research. The result is that the participants in this program will subsequently enter graduate programs leading to the PhD at major research institutions. In the first grant period, over 80% of participating post-baccalaureate students proceeded to biomedical or behavioral PhD programs at top institutions nationwide. The project we propose for renewal is expanded in two significant ways: we will increase the number of minority PREP Scholars from the current six to 12 per year, and by partnering with two major biomedical research institutions, the University of Southern California and The City of Hope/Beckman   Research Institute, will provide additional research training and education sites for our students. The 12 PREP Scholars will be employed as technicians by Cal State LA while undergoing career advancement through a post-baccalaureate program designed to increase their research skills; enhance their academic background in the biomedical sciences; integrate them into the broader Southern California biomedical research community; expose them to a broad range of biomedical sciences and scientists; and enhance their entry directly into PhD programs, or to MS programs en route to the PhD; and establish the foundation for their successful research careers in the biomedical sciences.      We aim to increase the number of minority PhD-level biomedical and behavioral scientists, with the   expectation that many will be motivated to work on those problems that disproportionately affect minority populations and have resulted in health disparities among Americans.           ",Cal State LA Biomedical PREP,7137411,R25GM064104,"['curriculum ', ' postgraduate education ', ' training ', ' health science profession ', ' minority health professional ', ' health science research potential ', ' career ', ' academic achievement ', ' ']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY LOS ANGELES,R25,2006,274766,0.14749139666452274

"Cal State LA Biomedical PREP    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  California State University Los Angeles (Cal State LA), a minority institution offering the MS as its highest degree, and with a long tradition of success in developing the careers of minority Americans in the biomedical sciences, proposes to renew its successful Biomedical Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (BIOMED PREP). The proposed and expanded program seeks to keep in the biomedical human capital pipeline the talents of capable minority individuals whose abilities might otherwise be lost to biomedical research. The result is that the participants in this program will subsequently enter graduate programs leading to the PhD at major research institutions. In the first grant period, over 80% of participating post-baccalaureate students proceeded to biomedical or behavioral PhD programs at top institutions nationwide. The project we propose for renewal is expanded in two significant ways: we will increase the number of minority PREP Scholars from the current six to 12 per year, and by partnering with two major biomedical research institutions, the University of Southern California and The City of Hope/Beckman   Research Institute, will provide additional research training and education sites for our students. The 12 PREP Scholars will be employed as technicians by Cal State LA while undergoing career advancement through a post-baccalaureate program designed to increase their research skills; enhance their academic background in the biomedical sciences; integrate them into the broader Southern California biomedical research community; expose them to a broad range of biomedical sciences and scientists; and enhance their entry directly into PhD programs, or to MS programs en route to the PhD; and establish the foundation for their successful research careers in the biomedical sciences.      We aim to increase the number of minority PhD-level biomedical and behavioral scientists, with the   expectation that many will be motivated to work on those problems that disproportionately affect minority populations and have resulted in health disparities among Americans.           ",Cal State LA Biomedical PREP,7268866,R25GM064104,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Institution ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Range ', ' Research Training ', ' Behavioral ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' career ', ' Grant ', ' Site ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Science ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Talents ', ' Scientist ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Route ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Training and Education ', ' American ', ' success ', ' California ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' human capital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' ']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY LOS ANGELES,R25,2007,269657,0.14749139666452274
"PREP: Addressing Health Disparities This application requests funds to establish and support a PREP at the Albany Medical College (AMC), focused on health disparities and designed to encourage underrepresented minorites who hold a recent baccalaureate degree in a biomedically relevant science to pursue a research doctorate. ""PREP: Addressing Health Disparities"" will draw opportunities from four academic departments at AMC in which research is related to health disparities, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, substance abuse and trauma, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and HIV. With careful attention and significant effort, talented and promising minority baccalaureate graduates who, for any reason, may have decided to postpone application to graduate school, will be recruited and will spend up to two years as an apprentice doing meaningful, authentic, mentored research in the laboratory of an NIH-funded investigator who has the time and inclination to invest in training these apprentices. Apprentices will spend 75% of their time doing research and increasing their laboratory competence, but will also take part in a series of important Enrichment Activities. Centered around aspects of health disparities, Enrichment Activities will be selected from an extensive list and arranged according to an Individual Educational Plan developed for each apprentice. PREP will be administered by a Program Director and an Apprentice Oversight Committee and thoroughly evaluated by a PREP Oversight Committee on an annual basis. The long-term objective is to increase the number of competitively trained underrepresented minorities who will go on to careers that address health problems that disproportionately affect minorities and the medically underserved. Extensive evaluation of apprentices and of the program, and tracking of all apprentices for several years during and after the program, will measure the effectiveness of the program against a cleady delineated set of outcome goals designed to meet the objective of the program announcement.

"Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goals of Mount Sinai School of Medicine's Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP), for which renewed support is sought, are to: (i) increase enrollment of under-represented minority (URM) PhD and MD-PhD students in our own graduate programs and in other excellent programs. The longer-term goal is to contribute to greater URM participation in biomedical research careers at a high level of achievement. We will demonstrate to recent URM college graduates that a career in biomedical research is an exciting and achievable choice for them. The central activity in this demonstration is a cutting-edge mentored research experience, supplemented critically by special seminars, works-in-progress, journal clubs and  opportunities to attend meetings, (ii) enhance PREP scholars' ability to succeed and, in significant numbers, to excel when they enter pre-doctoral programs. To achieve this, PREP scholars with be given the chance to adjust to a Graduate School/Medical Center environment as part of the supportive PREP mini-community and become full participants in the larger academic community before undertaking a full pre-doctoral course-load. PREP scholars will also have the option of taking or auditing appropriate course-work to experience the challenge of pre-doctoral academic work with a single course at a time and, when they succeed, gain confidence as well as a ""leg-up"" with respect to the requirements of their next program. An array of individualized development activities will enhance the skills of each PREP scholar from their own starting points, (iii) foster later participation in translational research and reduction of health care disparities by bringing them into the intense institutional efforts in these arenas as participants and/or learners.      Mount Sinai's PREP will build on the success of its first 4 years during which a large majority of the first   17 PREP scholars to complete PREP entered doctoral programs; 13 of the 17 scholars entered PhD (11) or MD-PhD (2) programs and are progressing strongly, with one more now applying to PhD programs. To further enhance this success and foster an even deeper engagement with issues of health and health care disparities, we will refine the Program elements, will carefully monitor the long-term success of the Program and evaluate the contribution of specific Program elements by collecting and analyzing both short- and longterm outcomes data.          ",Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP),7595796,R25GM064118,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Leg ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' NCI Scholars Program ', ' Scholars Program ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Depth ', ' Numbers ', ' Fostering ', ' Mentors ', ' Research ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Communities ', ' Outcome ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' ']",NIGMS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R25,2008,220720,0.33841873539243783

"UMass Amherst PREP Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to significantly increase the number of students from underrepresented groups who obtain Ph.D. degrees in biomedical fields. To this end, we will establish a one-year PREP internship that includes independent research and individualized programs of study, each with an interdisciplinary focus designed to increase the competitiveness of the PREP students for admission to rigorous biomedical graduate programs. Our project will capitalize on unique strengths of the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMA): A) UMA leads the Northeast Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NEAGEP), a highly interactive network of 15 minority-serving and research-extensive universities with demonstrated success in recruiting and retaining minority students STEM Ph.D. programs; B) UMA has well developed programs of interdisciplinary research and graduate education in biomedicine; C) UMA has developed effective multi-level mentoring programs to support diversity at all levels of academia. We will use these strengths to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Use existing connections in NEAGEP and at UMA to recruit talented students from underrepresented groups; 2) Pre-screen students through a well established eight-week summer program for undergraduate research (SPUR); 3) Train near-peer and faculty mentors through an eight-week workshop series, ""Entering Mentoring"", focused on working with students from diverse backgrounds; 4) Work with PREP participants and their mentors to formulate individualized programs of study based on interests, strengths and needs of students identified during SPUR; 5) Start mentoring on first contact and continue through graduate school and beyond. During the program, students will rotate through two laboratories and have two sets of faculty and near-peer graduate student mentors. The Institute for Cellular Engineering, Chemistry-Biology Interface and Neuroendocrinology graduate training programs will provide an interdisciplinary focus through specific enrichment courses. Students will participate in regular social and professional development activities, many with NEAGEP doctoral students so that PREP participants will be part of a larger community of minority scholars and role models. Group PREP courses will focus on working in interdisciplinary and diverse groups in biomedicine, developing critical thinking skills and gaining an understanding of the responsible conduct of research. Faculty mentors, PIs and the Office of Graduate Recruitment and Retention will teach students how to apply to graduate school and to obtain pre- doctoral fellowships. At the end of the program, we anticipate that students will enroll in one of the numerous biomedicine graduate programs served by the participating interdisciplinary training programs or in graduate programs in other NEAGEP institutions. This program will help meet the growing need for biomedical researchers who can address issues of all segments of our population.      The continuous multi-tiered mentoring and emphasis on interdisciplinary research inherent in the UMA PREP will increase the success of our students in doctoral programs and preparedness for biomedical research careers where the prevalence of multi-investigator projects is increasing.

"MU PREP SCHOLARS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The University of Missouri-Columbia (MU) proposes to identify, provide financial support, and train a total of 26 students from groups dramatically underrepresented in the biomedical sciences in order to prepare them to successfully enter and complete a PhD program in a biomedically related discipline at MU or any other highly competitive research intensive institution. The MU PREP is also designed to begin to prepare PREP Scholars for eventual entry into biomedical research careers in areas that address major health problems in the U.S. (e.g. cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer) with an emphasis on health problems that disproportionately affect portions of the U.S. population.       This proposal presents a coordinated plan to strengthen the research, academic, and personal interaction skills of promising and talented baccalaureate graduates by immersing each Scholar in an independent research project with a faculty mentor and providing a coordinated academic and personal support system. Specific MU PREP components include: design and completion of an independent research project; strong research mentoring by committed faculty, aided by prior training of faculty mentors; training in responsible conduct of research and scientific expression; critical thinking and analysis modules; peer and group mentoring; practice writing and critiquing papers and grant applications; and presentation of their research results at national/international meetings in the discipline. PREP Scholars should thus begin their PhD programs with advanced research skills, with a faculty and peer mentoring system in place, with connections to a broader discipline beyond MU, and with lasting friendships with other graduate students in the life sciences. The MU PREP program will be carefully coordinated with MU's high school, undergraduate and PhD programs for underrepresented students thereby advancing MU's comprehensive effort to increase the number of scholars from underrepresented populations in the biomedical sciences.

"UMass Amherst PREP Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to significantly increase the number of students from underrepresented groups who obtain Ph.D. degrees in biomedical fields. To this end, we will establish a one-year PREP internship that includes independent research and individualized programs of study, each with an interdisciplinary focus designed to increase the competitiveness of the PREP students for admission to rigorous biomedical graduate programs. Our project will capitalize on unique strengths of the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMA): A) UMA leads the Northeast Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NEAGEP), a highly interactive network of 15 minority-serving and research-extensive universities with demonstrated success in recruiting and retaining minority students STEM Ph.D. programs; B) UMA has well developed programs of interdisciplinary research and graduate education in biomedicine; C) UMA has developed effective multi-level mentoring programs to support diversity at all levels of academia. We will use these strengths to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Use existing connections in NEAGEP and at UMA to recruit talented students from underrepresented groups; 2) Pre-screen students through a well established eight-week summer program for undergraduate research (SPUR); 3) Train near-peer and faculty mentors through an eight-week workshop series, ""Entering Mentoring"", focused on working with students from diverse backgrounds; 4) Work with PREP participants and their mentors to formulate individualized programs of study based on interests, strengths and needs of students identified during SPUR; 5) Start mentoring on first contact and continue through graduate school and beyond. During the program, students will rotate through two laboratories and have two sets of faculty and near-peer graduate student mentors. The Institute for Cellular Engineering, Chemistry-Biology Interface and Neuroendocrinology graduate training programs will provide an interdisciplinary focus through specific enrichment courses. Students will participate in regular social and professional development activities, many with NEAGEP doctoral students so that PREP participants will be part of a larger community of minority scholars and role models. Group PREP courses will focus on working in interdisciplinary and diverse groups in biomedicine, developing critical thinking skills and gaining an understanding of the responsible conduct of research. Faculty mentors, PIs and the Office of Graduate Recruitment and Retention will teach students how to apply to graduate school and to obtain pre- doctoral fellowships. At the end of the program, we anticipate that students will enroll in one of the numerous biomedicine graduate programs served by the participating interdisciplinary training programs or in graduate programs in other NEAGEP institutions. This program will help meet the growing need for biomedical researchers who can address issues of all segments of our population.      The continuous multi-tiered mentoring and emphasis on interdisciplinary research inherent in the UMA PREP will increase the success of our students in doctoral programs and preparedness for biomedical research careers where the prevalence of multi-investigator projects is increasing. We expect our strategies to significantly increase the number of biomedical researchers from underrepresented groups.

"Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of Mount Sinai's Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (Mount Sinai PREP) is to make a significant contribution to increasing the number of biomedical scientists from underrepresented minority groups, disadvantaged backgrounds or those who live with the challenges of disability. We aim to prepare recent college graduates from these targeted groups to enroll and succeed in highly competitive Ph.D. or MD/Ph.D. programs so that they go on to develop independent research careers after their postdoctoral or residency/fellowship training. Now in its 8th year, Mount Sinai PREP has a strong and growing record of application and enrollment of its participants in excellent Ph.D. and MD/Ph.D. programs. Of the 26 who have enrolled in such programs, over 92% have progressed well. They are all supported by fellowships and traineeships, including 12 T32 traineeships and 6 F31 fellowships from NIH. The first Ph.D. awards are occurring with excellent time-lines and records of accomplishment this spring. Mount Sinai PREP has enhanced its recruitment of applicants to promote consistent enrollment of PREP participants whose motivation and levels of academic and research potential support their aspirations for research careers. PREP has also further enhanced its successful program strategies. Central strategies include: (i) ensuring that all PREP participants undertake a mentored research project in which their analytical, conceptual, and technical abilities are fostered; (ii) ensuring that they integrate fully into the laboratory group and culture, increase their ability to use and critique primary research literature and their ability to present their work; (iii) providing individualized help to eliminate gaps, impediments or health issues that might impede success; (iv) fostering the ability of PREP participants to succeed in rigorous doctoral level course-work. Important additional PREP strategies include: (i) acclimatizing the PREP group to the environment of a major academic medical center; (ii) encouraging interest in health and health care disparities through projects and grand rounds of the Center for Multi-Cultural and Community Affairs along with other student groups; (iii) networking them with Mount Sinai PREP alumni, ""Friends/Outside Advisors"" of PREP and other professionals whose stories inspire and advice is worthwhile. We continue to closely monitor, mentor, and interact with Mount Sinai PREP alumni. We enjoy the presence of 12 of them in programs on our campus, and expect some of them to become faculty colleagues and future PREP leaders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The PREP initiative seeks to increase the participation of individuals from underrepresented minority and disadvantaged as well as disabled individuals at the cutting-edge levels of biomedical research. Major benefits to public health will result from diversification of the biomedical research work-force because research practitioners from communities that struggle with negative health and health care disparities are highly motivated to undertake projects that address these disparities and projects that yield new therapies or preventive strategies for major health problems or illness of their communities. Diversification of the research workforce at the professoriate level will also address disparities in access of young people from similar backgrounds to high quality science education, thus increasing the rate of these positive changes.           Project Narrative: The PREP initiative seeks to increase the participation of individuals from underrepresented minority and disadvantaged as well as disabled individuals at the cutting-edge levels of biomedical research.

"SMART Post-Baccalaureate Ph.D. PREP Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The SMART PREP at BCM will continue to provide research and educational opportunities to better prepare promising underrepresented (UR) college graduates to enter and succeed in biomedical related Ph.D. programs and progress into biomedical research careers. BCM is ranked in the top 10% of US graduate schools granting biomedical Ph.D.s. BCM UR Ph.D. student enrollment increased by 400% from 1998 to 2007. UR students maximize their potential through individual development plans (IDP) and are often ranked among our best Ph.D. and MD/Ph.D. students. Creating IDPs for PREP apprentices is a key component of our PREPs. Participants will work 30 hrs/week as apprentices and conduct research at the frontier of biomedical science. Apprentices will participate intellectually in the research through directed reading of scientific papers, lab meetings, journal clubs and seminars. A research project will provide opportunities for apprentices to progress toward more independent function developing hypotheses, designing and conducting experiments, interpreting data, drawing conclusions and contributing to the preparation of a manuscript describing the work. The culmination of the project will involve summarizing the research in the form of a manuscript, to provide an experience that reflects the processes of scientific discovery and publication. Apprentices will build their knowledge in molecular and cellular biology (MCB) through a course that emphasizes experimental approaches, quantitative skills, ethical decision-making, URM health disparities and the contributions of URM scientists. There are 83 URM Ph.D. and MD/Ph.D. students enrolled in BCM programs. Some of these students will be selected as guest lecturers to present a ""research relevance"" for some MCB classes. Weekly analysis and problem solving meetings will enhance the ability to read and analyze the scientific literature and research with an emphasis on quantitative and writing skills. GRE preparatory workshops, graduate school application workshops, ethics and safety training, and skills building workshops will provide additional training in skills needed to succeed as a scientist. Individual or group tutoring and instruction will be provided in English, math or physical sciences as needed. Faculty and Ph.D. student mentoring and attending a UR student organization meetings, fall welcome and spring graduation receptions, and scientific conferences will help inspire and motivate participants to strive for excellence as they become members of the scientific community. Progression into Ph.D. programs will be facilitated by interacting with program directors (T32 training grant supported and other Ph.D. programs) through receptions and meetings with program directors and Ph.D. students. Formative and summative evaluations will assess progress and performance of apprentices, mentors, staff and the impact of the program on the institution and achievement of goals of the MORE Division of NIH, to diversify biomedicine.      The BCM SMART PREP will enhance education of under-represented (UR) students and their progression into Ph.D. biomedical programs.

"Arizona State University PREP for Biomedical Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of underrepresented individuals in the biomedical and behavioral sciences is improving, but more significant increases are still needed. Arizona State University (ASU) Biomedical Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) is designed to identify underrepresented baccalaureate graduates with significant potential and commitment to pursue a Ph.D. in these area, but for various reasons do not pursue this goal directly after graduation. ASU Biomedical PREP proposes in this renewal application to continue providing an additional year of preparation beyond the undergraduate degree to help 10 underrepresented graduates smoothly transition into highly competitive biomedical and behavioral graduate programs at ASU and throughout the country. The goal is for participants to successfully complete the Ph.D. and go on to pursue careers as strong investigators in academic or private sectors. The long term goal is to contribute to the development of a strong cohort of scientists that are keenly informed, highly committed and prepared to address important biomedical and behavioral research problems, particularly those that reduce health disparities. The specific goals are to (1) provide a strong intensive individualized mentored research experience, (2) strengthen communication, computational, analytical and critical thinking skills through the research experience, as well as formal and informal activities and (3) provide insight into career options, including information about research focused on elimination of health disparities. PREP students will be recruited from ASU and through contacts with the University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, and other institutions, especially in California and the Southwest. Students will work with the Director, mentor and other faculty to establish an individualized development plan that focuses on mentored research, academic preparation and skills/training activities to strengthen verbal, analytical and critical thinking skills.

"KU Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek continuation of the KU Post Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) that has exceeded its goals in the recruitment and training of American Indian (AI) and other underrepresented minorities (URMs). Within the three years since its inception, 23 URMs have been accepted into the program. Over half (13) are AI, and nine attended our long-term partnering tribal college, Haskell Indian Nations University. All 11 scholars that successfully completed the program have entered graduate school. Six are enrolled in doctoral programs, and five are enrolled or have completed masters programs with the potential to continue into PhD programs. Four additional scholars are applying to graduate school, bringing the total of PREP scholars either enrolled in or applying to graduate school to near 65% of the students who enrolled in the program. Continuation of KU PREP will build on these successes and permit refinements that respond to a formative evaluation of the program. Talented PREP scholars with a bachelor's degree who find themselves under-prepared for graduate work will be recruited from Haskell, KU, and other institutions. An individualized student development plan (IDP) will be created for each scholar based on the results of careful academic evaluation and assessments made by skilled professionals. A central focus of the IDP will be research training; consequently, PREP scholars will be Apprentice Scientists, each assigned a KU faculty researcher and a mentoring team. All participating mentors have demonstrated their abilities to work with minority students like those engaged at the University of Kansas. KU's PREP also enhances math, reading and writing, and leadership skills to guarantee scholar success in highly competitive graduate programs. IDPs include coursework in professional writing that enhances the PREP scholars' ability to critique, synthesize, and communicate within their chosen fields. KU Math department faculty work with individual scholars to elevate their quantitative skills to an advanced level appropriate for today's scientific research. All PREP scholars complete a series of seminars in the responsible conduct of research, test taking strategies, applying to graduate school, and professional development workshops that improve their overall qualifications for graduate school. Modifications in response to program evaluation will allow KU PREP to advance at least 75% of its scholars into graduate school with a PhD completion rate of 80%, thereby increasing the number of AI and other URMs within the biomedical research community.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will increase the diversity of the scientific community by preparing American Indians and other underrepresented students for graduate study and eventual careers in biomedical research.

"Understanding PrEP Implementation Among Club Drug Using Men Who Have Sex With Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were over 55,000 new HIV infections identified in the United States in 2006, and >50% were among men who report having sex with other men (MSM) (CDC, 2008). Substance use, in particular crystal methamphetamine and other club drugs (e.g., ecstasy, GHB, etc.) are highly associated with HIV sexual risk behavior and HIV infection among MSM. The use of the antiretrovirals tenofovir  emtricitabine as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a novel biomedical HIV prevention strategy to help decrease HIV spread. Recent trials in HIV-uninfected men and women have demonstrated that PrEP is safe and well-tolerated, and data from a multinational randomized controlled trial of daily oral PrEP among 2,499 MSM were recently released, and show a significant decrease in HIV acquisition (Grant, Lama et al. 2010). Although harm reduction strategies such as needle exchange programs have been shown to decrease HIV infection among injection drug users (IDUs), it is unclear how PrEP will be utilized among MSM who use club drugs and engage in HIV sexual risk behavior.  Overview of project. We propose to conduct qualitative interviews (phase 1) and a larger quantitative assessment (phase 2) among HIV-uninfected MSM who report recent club drug use and concurrent sexual risk (in the last 3 months) to gain a better understanding of the facilitators and barriers to PrEP implementation in this high risk group. All participants will be recruited from bars, nightclubs, and dance clubs in the Boston area that are known to attract gay and bisexual men and other MSM where club drug use is occurring. The phase 1 qualitative interviews will be conducted among 40 HIV-uninfected MSM to understand the potential factors surrounding PrEP acceptability, intent to use, and perceived ability to take PrEP among MSM with varied levels of club drug use who are at risk for HIV. We will rapidly analyze these data to inform and strengthen questions for the larger quantitative survey assessment (phase 2). In phase 2, Date-Time-Venue sampling will be used to recruit a random sample of 375 MSM (allowing for a 20% attrition from their recruitment venue to their in person assessment visit, yielding 300 total for the phase 2 assessment) from a variety of venues (bars, night clubs, dance clubs) in the greater Boston area. Of these 300 MSM, 50% will meet DSM-IV criteria for abuse/dependence of a given club drug and the other 50% will be those who have reported recent club drug use, but do not meet criteria for abuse/dependence (i.e., infrequent users). The lessons learned will provide key insights in the development of interventions to enhance PrEP adoption and utilization in this high-risk subpopulation of MSM.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Data over the last 3 months has shown evidence supporting a role for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as a method to decrease HIV transmission in high-risk men who have sex with men (MSM). MSM who use drugs to enhance sexual activity is a subpopulation that has been shown to have an increased risk of HIV infection through sexual risk behavior compared to the general population, and MSM who do not use drugs. It is therefore essential that we understand the facilitators and barriers to PrEP implementation in this subpopulation of MSM who are at greater risk for HIV. The lessons learned will be applied to intervention development to enhance acceptance and utilization of biomedical preventions such as PrEP among this high- risk group.              Data over the last 3 months has shown evidence supporting a role for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as a method to decrease HIV transmission in high-risk men who have sex with men (MSM).

"Post-baccalaureate Training in Biomedical Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The majority of research training programs for individuals from underrepresented groups focus only on basic science research. Although critically important, these programs often fail to provide the motivational link between basic science research and improved health. The goal of the Mayo Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) is to increase the number of individuals from underrepresented groups who choose biomedical research careers, especially disease-oriented research. The program assists both those likely to succeed and those for whom the PREP experience may truly be pivotal in their career paths. Our hypothesis is that students from underrepresented groups increasingly choose disease-directed basic or translational research careers when they clearly see the value of this research in improving human health. Mayo's PREP is successful and mature, having been a unique cornerstone of institutional education diversity efforts since Mayo pioneered this program nationally in 1996. Mayo's ongoing commitment to diversity is supported from the highest executive level and has resulted in significant positive changes at the institution. The unique, highly-integrated clinical and biomedical research programs at Mayo provide an ideal environment to foster the career goals of apprentice scientists. Mayo's PhD graduate school, medical school, MSTP training site, and residency program are parts of the famed Mayo Clinic tertiary care center. Sustained funding of the Mayo PREP positively impacts diversity across the Mayo campus. The PREP synergizes with other ongoing Mayo diversity programs, including Mayo's NIH IMSD pre-doctoral program, URM summer research programs, and other institutionally-supported diversity education initiatives directed through Mayo's newly-formed Education Office for Diversity. Mayo's successful PREP and IMSD programs celebrate peer mentoring and mutual support between URM students across the summer undergraduate, clinical research, PREP, PhD, and MD/PhD research spectrum. This synergy is critical for student self-efficacy, identity as biomedical research scientists, and elucidation of the training path. PREP progress during the prior funding cycle, together with longitudinal data derived from 13 cohorts of prior PREP students, provides objective evidence of success in promoting graduate training leading to the PhD degree. During the next funding cycle we will maintain our successful program while increasing program evaluation, mentor training, and recruitment. Specific aims: 1. Recruit to Mayo 9 new post-baccalaureate apprentice scientists each year (total of up to 36 over 4 years) for a program of research with intensive enrichment toward individualized student academic and professional development. PREP apprentice scientists may receive one or two years of training, depending on their needs. 2. Maintain Mayo's PREP program where > 75% of post-baccalaureate apprentice scientists enter PhD or MD/PhD programs with a primary interest in laboratory-based or translational research. 3. Enrich Mayo's post-baccalaureate apprentice scientists with skills important for successful initiation and completion of the PhD degree. Each aspect of the Mayo PREP program is designed to enhance students' creativity, self-efficacy, commitment, and purpose as scientists. The program offers activities specifically designed to encourage student interest in research areas related to health disparities. 4. Improve long-term contact and ongoing mentoring of Mayo post-baccalaureate apprentice scientists through graduate school and beyond. We will achieve this goal in synergy with Mayo's NIH-funded IMSD program for minority pre-doctoral students, and with Mayo's Education Office for Diversity. 5. Continue internal and external evaluation with semi-structured interviews ensuring increased utility, feasibility, propriety, and accuracy of Mayo's PREP activities.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research education program will provide 1 or 2 years of support and professional skills development for recent college graduates. The goal is to help students from diverse backgrounds (e.g. ethnic/racial minorities, individuals with disabilities, and individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds) to advance to successful biomedical research careers at the PhD level thus contributing to the diversification of the biomedical research workforce.           This research education program will provide 1 or 2 years of support and professional skills development for recent college graduates.

"UMass Amherst PREP Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to significantly increase the number of students from underrepresented groups who obtain Ph.D. degrees in biomedical fields. To this end, we will establish a one-year PREP internship that includes independent research and individualized programs of study, each with an interdisciplinary focus designed to increase the competitiveness of the PREP students for admission to rigorous biomedical graduate programs. Our project will capitalize on unique strengths of the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMA): A) UMA leads the Northeast Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NEAGEP), a highly interactive network of 15 minority-serving and research-extensive universities with demonstrated success in recruiting and retaining minority students STEM Ph.D. programs; B) UMA has well developed programs of interdisciplinary research and graduate education in biomedicine; C) UMA has developed effective multi-level mentoring programs to support diversity at all levels of academia. We will use these strengths to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Use existing connections in NEAGEP and at UMA to recruit talented students from underrepresented groups; 2) Pre-screen students through a well established eight-week summer program for undergraduate research (SPUR); 3) Train near-peer and faculty mentors through an eight-week workshop series, ""Entering Mentoring"", focused on working with students from diverse backgrounds; 4) Work with PREP participants and their mentors to formulate individualized programs of study based on interests, strengths and needs of students identified during SPUR; 5) Start mentoring on first contact and continue through graduate school and beyond. During the program, students will rotate through two laboratories and have two sets of faculty and near-peer graduate student mentors. The Institute for Cellular Engineering, Chemistry-Biology Interface and Neuroendocrinology graduate training programs will provide an interdisciplinary focus through specific enrichment courses. Students will participate in regular social and professional development activities, many with NEAGEP doctoral students so that PREP participants will be part of a larger community of minority scholars and role models. Group PREP courses will focus on working in interdisciplinary and diverse groups in biomedicine, developing critical thinking skills and gaining an understanding of the responsible conduct of research. Faculty mentors, PIs and the Office of Graduate Recruitment and Retention will teach students how to apply to graduate school and to obtain pre- doctoral fellowships. At the end of the program, we anticipate that students will enroll in one of the numerous biomedicine graduate programs served by the participating interdisciplinary training programs or in graduate programs in other NEAGEP institutions. This program will help meet the growing need for biomedical researchers who can address issues of all segments of our population.      The continuous multi-tiered mentoring and emphasis on interdisciplinary research inherent in the UMA PREP will increase the success of our students in doctoral programs and preparedness for biomedical research careers where the prevalence of multi-investigator projects is increasing. We expect our strategies to significantly increase the number of biomedical researchers from underrepresented groups. The strategies we devise will be transferrable and will help develop the diverse workforce needed to address disparities in healthcare and ensure continued international preeminence in biomedicine and biotechnology.          ",UMass Amherst PREP Program,8242674,R25GM086264,"['cellular engineering ', ' cell engineering ', ' role model ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' Graduate Education ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Left ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' peer ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' career ', ' skills ', ' Minority ', ' Faculty ', ' Series ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' graduate student ', ' Fellowship ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Institutes ', ' social ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Schools ', ' Institution ', ' Running ', ' Prevalence ', ' Economics ', ' Chemistry ', ' Mentors ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Talents ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Wisconsin ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' Social Development ', ' Academia ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Program Development ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Mathematics ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' handicapping condition ', ' handicapping ', ' Infirmity ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' interest ', ' Goals ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' experience ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' novel ', ' Biology ', ' Funding ', ' Population ', ' programs ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Area ', ' Science ', ' Training Programs ', ' meetings ', ' cohort ', ' Training ', ' Students ', ' Native Americans ', ' Address ', ' success ', ' Technology ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Universities ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Work ', ' International ', ' Ensure ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Research ', ' Laboratories ', ' Engineering ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Medical ', ' base ', ' Communities ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Internships ', ' Neuroendocrinology ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R25,2011,367747,0.19395831334934174

"Understanding PrEP Implementation Among Club Drug Using Men Who Have Sex With Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were over 55,000 new HIV infections identified in the United States in 2006, and >50% were among men who report having sex with other men (MSM) (CDC, 2008). Substance use, in particular crystal methamphetamine and other club drugs (e.g., ecstasy, GHB, etc.) are highly associated with HIV sexual risk behavior and HIV infection among MSM. The use of the antiretrovirals tenofovir  emtricitabine as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a novel biomedical HIV prevention strategy to help decrease HIV spread. Recent trials in HIV-uninfected men and women have demonstrated that PrEP is safe and well-tolerated, and data from a multinational randomized controlled trial of daily oral PrEP among 2,499 MSM were recently released, and show a significant decrease in HIV acquisition (Grant, Lama et al. 2010). Although harm reduction strategies such as needle exchange programs have been shown to decrease HIV infection among injection drug users (IDUs), it is unclear how PrEP will be utilized among MSM who use club drugs and engage in HIV sexual risk behavior.  Overview of project. We propose to conduct qualitative interviews (phase 1) and a larger quantitative assessment (phase 2) among HIV-uninfected MSM who report recent club drug use and concurrent sexual risk (in the last 3 months) to gain a better understanding of the facilitators and barriers to PrEP implementation in this high risk group. All participants will be recruited from bars, nightclubs, and dance clubs in the Boston area that are known to attract gay and bisexual men and other MSM where club drug use is occurring. The phase 1 qualitative interviews will be conducted among 40 HIV-uninfected MSM to understand the potential factors surrounding PrEP acceptability, intent to use, and perceived ability to take PrEP among MSM with varied levels of club drug use who are at risk for HIV. We will rapidly analyze these data to inform and strengthen questions for the larger quantitative survey assessment (phase 2). In phase 2, Date-Time-Venue sampling will be used to recruit a random sample of 375 MSM (allowing for a 20% attrition from their recruitment venue to their in person assessment visit, yielding 300 total for the phase 2 assessment) from a variety of venues (bars, night clubs, dance clubs) in the greater Boston area. Of these 300 MSM, 50% will meet DSM-IV criteria for abuse/dependence of a given club drug and the other 50% will be those who have reported recent club drug use, but do not meet criteria for abuse/dependence (i.e., infrequent users). The lessons learned will provide key insights in the development of interventions to enhance PrEP adoption and utilization in this high-risk subpopulation of MSM.        Data over the last 3 months has shown evidence supporting a role for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as a method to decrease HIV transmission in high-risk men who have sex with men (MSM). MSM who use drugs to enhance sexual activity is a subpopulation that has been shown to have an increased risk of HIV infection through sexual risk behavior compared to the general population, and MSM who do not use drugs. It is therefore essential that we understand the facilitators and barriers to PrEP implementation in this subpopulation of MSM who are at greater risk for HIV. The lessons learned will be applied to intervention development to enhance acceptance and utilization of biomedical preventions such as PrEP among this high- risk group.

"KU Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek continuation of the KU Post Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) that has exceeded its goals in the recruitment and training of American Indian (AI) and other underrepresented minorities (URMs). Within the three years since its inception, 23 URMs have been accepted into the program. Over half (13) are AI, and nine attended our long-term partnering tribal college, Haskell Indian Nations University. All 11 scholars that successfully completed the program have entered graduate school. Six are enrolled in doctoral programs, and five are enrolled or have completed masters programs with the potential to continue into PhD programs. Four additional scholars are applying to graduate school, bringing the total of PREP scholars either enrolled in or applying to graduate school to near 65% of the students who enrolled in the program. Continuation of KU PREP will build on these successes and permit refinements that respond to a formative evaluation of the program. Talented PREP scholars with a bachelor's degree who find themselves under-prepared for graduate work will be recruited from Haskell, KU, and other institutions. An individualized student development plan (IDP) will be created for each scholar based on the results of careful academic evaluation and assessments made by skilled professionals. A central focus of the IDP will be research training; consequently, PREP scholars will be Apprentice Scientists, each assigned a KU faculty researcher and a mentoring team. All participating mentors have demonstrated their abilities to work with minority students like those engaged at the University of Kansas. KU's PREP also enhances math, reading and writing, and leadership skills to guarantee scholar success in highly competitive graduate programs. IDPs include coursework in professional writing that enhances the PREP scholars' ability to critique, synthesize, and communicate within their chosen fields. KU Math department faculty work with individual scholars to elevate their quantitative skills to an advanced level appropriate for today's scientific research. All PREP scholars complete a series of seminars in the responsible conduct of research, test taking strategies, applying to graduate school, and professional development workshops that improve their overall qualifications for graduate school. Modifications in response to program evaluation will allow KU PREP to advance at least 75% of its scholars into graduate school with a PhD completion rate of 80%, thereby increasing the number of AI and other URMs within the biomedical research community.

"Arizona State University PREP for Biomedical Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of underrepresented individuals in the biomedical and behavioral sciences is improving, but more significant increases are still needed. Arizona State University (ASU) Biomedical Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) is designed to identify underrepresented baccalaureate graduates with significant potential and commitment to pursue a Ph.D. in these area, but for various reasons do not pursue this goal directly after graduation. ASU Biomedical PREP proposes in this renewal application to continue providing an additional year of preparation beyond the undergraduate degree to help 10 underrepresented graduates smoothly transition into highly competitive biomedical and behavioral graduate programs at ASU and throughout the country. The goal is for participants to successfully complete the Ph.D. and go on to pursue careers as strong investigators in academic or private sectors. The long term goal is to contribute to the development of a strong cohort of scientists that are keenly informed, highly committed and prepared to address important biomedical and behavioral research problems, particularly those that reduce health disparities. The specific goals are to (1) provide a strong intensive individualized mentored research experience, (2) strengthen communication, computational, analytical and critical thinking skills through the research experience, as well as formal and informal activities and (3) provide insight into career options, including information about research focused on elimination of health disparities. PREP students will be recruited from ASU and through contacts with the University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, and other institutions, especially in California and the Southwest. Students will work with the Director, mentor and other faculty to establish an individualized development plan that focuses on mentored research, academic preparation and skills/training activities to strengthen verbal, analytical and critical thinking skills. Participants will interact with graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty through participation in seminars, journal clubs, lab meetings, local graduate symposia, national meetings and a series of Graduate College programs and activities. PREP will be evaluated on a continuing basis by the Director, Advisory Committee, mentors, evaluators and external advisors.

"UMass Amherst PREP Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to significantly increase the number of students from underrepresented groups who obtain Ph.D. degrees in biomedical fields. To this end, we will establish a one-year PREP internship that includes independent research and individualized programs of study, each with an interdisciplinary focus designed to increase the competitiveness of the PREP students for admission to rigorous biomedical graduate programs. Our project will capitalize on unique strengths of the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMA): A) UMA leads the Northeast Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NEAGEP), a highly interactive network of 15 minority-serving and research-extensive universities with demonstrated success in recruiting and retaining minority students STEM Ph.D. programs; B) UMA has well developed programs of interdisciplinary research and graduate education in biomedicine; C) UMA has developed effective multi-level mentoring programs to support diversity at all levels of academia. We will use these strengths to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Use existing connections in NEAGEP and at UMA to recruit talented students from underrepresented groups; 2) Pre-screen students through a well established eight-week summer program for undergraduate research (SPUR); 3) Train near-peer and faculty mentors through an eight-week workshop series, ""Entering Mentoring"", focused on working with students from diverse backgrounds; 4) Work with PREP participants and their mentors to formulate individualized programs of study based on interests, strengths and needs of students identified during SPUR; 5) Start mentoring on first contact and continue through graduate school and beyond. During the program, students will rotate through two laboratories and have two sets of faculty and near-peer graduate student mentors. The Institute for Cellular Engineering, Chemistry-Biology Interface and Neuroendocrinology graduate training programs will provide an interdisciplinary focus through specific enrichment courses. Students will participate in regular social and professional development activities, many with NEAGEP doctoral students so that PREP participants will be part of a larger community of minority scholars and role models. Group PREP courses will focus on working in interdisciplinary and diverse groups in biomedicine, developing critical thinking skills and gaining an understanding of the responsible conduct of research. Faculty mentors, PIs and the Office of Graduate Recruitment and Retention will teach students how to apply to graduate school and to obtain pre- doctoral fellowships. At the end of the program, we anticipate that students will enroll in one of the numerous biomedicine graduate programs served by the participating interdisciplinary training programs or in graduate programs in other NEAGEP institutions. This program will help meet the growing need for biomedical researchers who can address issues of all segments of our population.      The continuous multi-tiered mentoring and emphasis on interdisciplinary research inherent in the UMA PREP will increase the success of our students in doctoral programs and preparedness for biomedical research careers where the prevalence of multi-investigator projects is increasing. We expect our strategies to significantly increase the number of biomedical researchers from underrepresented groups. The strategies we devise will be transferrable and will help develop the diverse workforce needed to address disparities in healthcare and ensure continued international preeminence in biomedicine and biotechnology.

"Intervention to Enhance PrEP Uptake and Adherence in a Community-Based Setting     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) refers to daily or intermittent oral administration of antiretroviral drugs designed to protect high-risk HIV-negative individuals from infection. As PrEP is, at present, the most promising biomedical HIV prevention tool, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released interim guidance for health care providers in January 2011, and is expected to soon release detailed public health guidelines for its use. However, in order for PrEP to become an effective prevention tool, three critical factors must be addressed: a) acceptability, i.e., individuals who would benefit from PrEP must know about it and be willing to take it; b) adherence, i.e., individuals who choose to PrEP as a prevention strategy must take the pills as prescribed; and c) implementation, i.e., processes and protocols must be developed to allow for the integration of PrEP delivery and programs into real world settings in a way that is feasible, scalable, and realistic. The proposed project is a two-phase study, conducted in collaboration with the largest LGBT community health provider in New York City (NYC). This project will focus on three specific aims: 1) Identifying social and behavioral factors that are likely to influence PrEP implementation, acceptance, and use/adherence by MSM in NYC, including factors at individual-, community-, and organizational-levels; 2) Examining social and behavioral factors associated with disparities in access to prevention and care services among MSM in NYC that might directly impact PrEP implementation programs and policies; and 3) Evaluating an intervention in which PrEP is introduced, provided, and supported as part of a prevention package delivered in an community health center. To achieve these aims, the project will enroll high-risk MSM to test a two-stage behavioral intervention. First, eligible participants will be randomized to receive either basic information about PrEP availability or a targeted intervention designed to increase PrEP uptake. Second, participants who accept PrEP (regardless of condition) will be randomized to receive either basic adherence information or an enhanced PrEP adherence intervention. Participants will be followed quarterly for 12 months. Outcome variables will include: PrEP uptake, PrEP persistence, PrEP adherence (measured through self-report and biological measures), STI incidence, and self-reported risk behavior. The project is particularly innovative in that it combines an efficacy and effectiveness trial, testing a new intervention in the setting in which it would most feasibly be delivered, and pioneering a new approach to community-based collaboration and study design that can accelerate the pace of implementation science. The proposed project has the potential to exert a sustained and powerful influence not only on the effectiveness of PrEP interventions for MSM, but also on dissemination and scalability of a targeted intervention within community-based settings and in a manner that reduces disparities in access and maximizes cultural competence and acceptability.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a new biomedical approach to HIV prevention with the potential to become a powerful tool. This study identifies social and behavioral factors likely to influence PrEP acceptability and adherence among MSM, and collaborates with a community health center to evaluate a two- stage intervention to improve PrEP uptake, persistence, and adherence.

"PrEP for Black MSM: Community-Based Ethnography and Clinic-Based Treatment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, men who have sex with men (MSM) comprise the group most severely affected by the HIV epidemic: 61% of all new infections in 2009 occurred in this population. Black MSM experience an even more disproportionate burden of infections, with prevalence of 28% in contrast to 16% in White, non- Latino MSM. HIV-infected Black MSM are also more likely than White MSM to receive an HIV diagnosis at  their first testing experience, suggesting that they are less likely than other group to benefit from HIV  prevention and control services. Clearly, the reduction of HIV-related disparities in Black MSM is a national health priority, essential to the success of efforts to contol and prevent HIV/AIDS as articulated in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), which has been shown to reduce acquisition among MSM, could play a critical role in the next generation of combination prevention interventions. Before  PrEP is scaled up on a national level, however, critical questions must be answered regarding both the  community-level factors that will shape uptake of and adherence to PrEP among Black MSM and the optimal  clinical package for delivering PrEP in a way that is both scalable and effective.   There is, moreover, a relationship between the broader social needs and perceptions of Black MSM and that clinical care package, and so we propose a multi-method study that incorporates community-based ethnography and an intervention in a community primary care clinic.  The community-based ethnographic  research will consist of institutional mapping, key informant interviews, ethnographic interviews with a  systematic ethnographic sample, participant observation, and analysis of material culture. Drawing on the concepts of social risk, life projects, and social networks, we will explore the structural and cultural factors that shape men's sexual relationships, health systems engagement, and knowledge attitudes and practices related to HIV prevention in general and PrEP in particular. Findings from the ethnographic research will provide urgently needed information regarding community-contextual factors relevant to designing combination prevention interventions that include PrEP, and will lay the groundwork for the randomized controlled trial for PrEP for Black MSM in a community-based clinic. The clinic-based research will randomize eligible HIV- negative Black MSM to an enhanced versus standard PrEP package of care and compare their effectiveness on adherence with PrEP and reduction in sexual risk behaviors. The RCT will generate critical information regarding the acceptability of PrEP for Black MSM in a community clinical context, adherence to PrEP under non-experimental conditions, health providers' experiences with PrEP, and the impact of PrEP on sexual risk practices.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Black Men who have sex with men (MSM) have among the highest rates of new HIV infections of any group in the United States, and developing effective HIV prevention interventions that work with this group is a critical element of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy.

"Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of Mount Sinai's Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (Mount Sinai PREP) is to make a significant contribution to increasing the number of biomedical scientists from underrepresented minority groups, disadvantaged backgrounds or those who live with the challenges of disability. We aim to prepare recent college graduates from these targeted groups to enroll and succeed in highly competitive Ph.D. or MD/Ph.D. programs so that they go on to develop independent research careers after their postdoctoral or residency/fellowship training. Now in its 8th year, Mount Sinai PREP has a strong and growing record of application and enrollment of its participants in excellent Ph.D. and MD/Ph.D. programs. Of the 26 who have enrolled in such programs, over 92% have progressed well. They are all supported by fellowships and traineeships, including 12 T32 traineeships and 6 F31 fellowships from NIH. The first Ph.D. awards are occurring with excellent time-lines and records of accomplishment this spring. Mount Sinai PREP has enhanced its recruitment of applicants to promote consistent enrollment of PREP participants whose motivation and levels of academic and research potential support their aspirations for research careers. PREP has also further enhanced its successful program strategies. Central strategies include: (i) ensuring that all PREP participants undertake a mentored research project in which their analytical, conceptual, and technical abilities are fostered; (ii) ensuring that they integrate fully into the laboratory group and culture, increase their ability to use and critique primary research literature and their ability to present their work; (iii) providing individualized help to eliminate gaps, impediments or health issues that might impede success; (iv) fostering the ability of PREP participants to succeed in rigorous doctoral level course-work. Important additional PREP strategies include: (i) acclimatizing the PREP group to the environment of a major academic medical center; (ii) encouraging interest in health and health care disparities through projects and grand rounds of the Center for Multi-Cultural and Community Affairs along with other student groups; (iii) networking them with Mount Sinai PREP alumni, ""Friends/Outside Advisors"" of PREP and other professionals whose stories inspire and advice is worthwhile. We continue to closely monitor, mentor, and interact with Mount Sinai PREP alumni. We enjoy the presence of 12 of them in programs on our campus, and expect some of them to become faculty colleagues and future PREP leaders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The PREP initiative seeks to increase the participation of individuals from underrepresented minority and disadvantaged as well as disabled individuals at the cutting-edge levels of biomedical research. Major benefits to public health will result from diversification of the biomedical research work-force because research practitioners from communities that struggle with negative health and health care disparities are highly motivated to undertake projects that address these disparities and projects that yield new therapies or preventive strategies for major health problems or illness of their communities. Diversification of the research workforce at the professoriate level will also address disparities in access of young people from similar backgrounds to high quality science education, thus increasing the rate of these positive changes.

"MU PREP SCHOLARS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The University of Missouri-Columbia (MU) proposes to identify, provide financial support, and train a total of 26 students from groups dramatically underrepresented in the biomedical sciences in order to prepare them to successfully enter and complete a PhD program in a biomedically related discipline at MU or any other highly competitive research intensive institution. The MU PREP is also designed to begin to prepare PREP Scholars for eventual entry into biomedical research careers in areas that address major health problems in the U.S. (e.g. cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer) with an emphasis on health problems that disproportionately affect portions of the U.S. population.       This proposal presents a coordinated plan to strengthen the research, academic, and personal interaction skills of promising and talented baccalaureate graduates by immersing each Scholar in an independent research project with a faculty mentor and providing a coordinated academic and personal support system. Specific MU PREP components include: design and completion of an independent research project; strong research mentoring by committed faculty, aided by prior training of faculty mentors; training in responsible conduct of research and scientific expression; critical thinking and analysis modules; peer and group mentoring; practice writing and critiquing papers and grant applications; and presentation of their research results at national/international meetings in the discipline. PREP Scholars should thus begin their PhD programs with advanced research skills, with a faculty and peer mentoring system in place, with connections to a broader discipline beyond MU, and with lasting friendships with other graduate students in the life sciences. The MU PREP program will be carefully coordinated with MU's high school, undergraduate and PhD programs for underrepresented students thereby advancing MU's comprehensive effort to increase the number of scholars from underrepresented populations in the biomedical sciences. Successful parts of this program will be institutionalized and disseminated as a model for other institutions.

"Post-baccalaureate Training in Biomedical Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The majority of research training programs for individuals from underrepresented groups focus only on basic science research. Although critically important, these programs often fail to provide the motivational link between basic science research and improved health. The goal of the Mayo Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) is to increase the number of individuals from underrepresented groups who choose biomedical research careers, especially disease-oriented research. The program assists both those likely to succeed and those for whom the PREP experience may truly be pivotal in their career paths. Our hypothesis is that students from underrepresented groups increasingly choose disease-directed basic or translational research careers when they clearly see the value of this research in improving human health. Mayo's PREP is successful and mature, having been a unique cornerstone of institutional education diversity efforts since Mayo pioneered this program nationally in 1996. Mayo's ongoing commitment to diversity is supported from the highest executive level and has resulted in significant positive changes at the institution. The unique, highly-integrated clinical and biomedical research programs at Mayo provide an ideal environment to foster the career goals of apprentice scientists. Mayo's PhD graduate school, medical school, MSTP training site, and residency program are parts of the famed Mayo Clinic tertiary care center. Sustained funding of the Mayo PREP positively impacts diversity across the Mayo campus. The PREP synergizes with other ongoing Mayo diversity programs, including Mayo's NIH IMSD pre-doctoral program, URM summer research programs, and other institutionally-supported diversity education initiatives directed through Mayo's newly-formed Education Office for Diversity. Mayo's successful PREP and IMSD programs celebrate peer mentoring and mutual support between URM students across the summer undergraduate, clinical research, PREP, PhD, and MD/PhD research spectrum. This synergy is critical for student self-efficacy, identity as biomedical research scientists, and elucidation of the training path. PREP progress during the prior funding cycle, together with longitudinal data derived from 13 cohorts of prior PREP students, provides objective evidence of success in promoting graduate training leading to the PhD degree. During the next funding cycle we will maintain our successful program while increasing program evaluation, mentor training, and recruitment. Specific aims: 1. Recruit to Mayo 9 new post-baccalaureate apprentice scientists each year (total of up to 36 over 4 years) for a program of research with intensive enrichment toward individualized student academic and professional development. PREP apprentice scientists may receive one or two years of training, depending on their needs. 2. Maintain Mayo's PREP program where > 75% of post-baccalaureate apprentice scientists enter PhD or MD/PhD programs with a primary interest in laboratory-based or translational research. 3. Enrich Mayo's post-baccalaureate apprentice scientists with skills important for successful initiation and completion of the PhD degree. Each aspect of the Mayo PREP program is designed to enhance students' creativity, self-efficacy, commitment, and purpose as scientists. The program offers activities specifically designed to encourage student interest in research areas related to health disparities. 4. Improve long-term contact and ongoing mentoring of Mayo post-baccalaureate apprentice scientists through graduate school and beyond. We will achieve this goal in synergy with Mayo's NIH-funded IMSD program for minority pre-doctoral students, and with Mayo's Education Office for Diversity. 5. Continue internal and external evaluation with semi-structured interviews ensuring increased utility, feasibility, propriety, and accuracy of Mayo's PREP activities.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research education program will provide 1 or 2 years of support and professional skills development for recent college graduates. The goal is to help students from diverse backgrounds (e.g. ethnic/racial minorities, individuals with disabilities, and individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds) to advance to successful biomedical research careers at the PhD level thus contributing to the diversification of the biomedical research workforce.

Together these efforts will provide critical information for building more effective HIV prevention interventions or this at-risk population.                      ",PrEP for Black MSM: Community-Based Ethnography and Clinic-Based Treatment,8549302,R01MH098723,"['Affect ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Couples ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Maps ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' New York City ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' base ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' uptake ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Pill ', ' pill (pharmacologic) ', ' Population Group ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Social Concepts ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical trial ', ' pre-clinical trial ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' preclinical study ', ' sexual relationship ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' primary care setting ', ' social science research ', ' arm ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2013,603013,0.22388926809141732
"Post-baccalaureate Training in Biomedical Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The majority of research training programs for individuals from underrepresented groups focus only on basic science research. Although critically important, these programs often fail to provide the motivational link between basic science research and improved health. The goal of the Mayo Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) is to increase the number of individuals from underrepresented groups who choose biomedical research careers, especially disease-oriented research. The program assists both those likely to succeed and those for whom the PREP experience may truly be pivotal in their career paths. Our hypothesis is that students from underrepresented groups increasingly choose disease-directed basic or translational research careers when they clearly see the value of this research in improving human health. Mayo's PREP is successful and mature, having been a unique cornerstone of institutional education diversity efforts since Mayo pioneered this program nationally in 1996. Mayo's ongoing commitment to diversity is supported from the highest executive level and has resulted in significant positive changes at the institution. The unique, highly-integrated clinical and biomedical research programs at Mayo provide an ideal environment to foster the career goals of apprentice scientists. Mayo's PhD graduate school, medical school, MSTP training site, and residency program are parts of the famed Mayo Clinic tertiary care center. Sustained funding of the Mayo PREP positively impacts diversity across the Mayo campus. The PREP synergizes with other ongoing Mayo diversity programs, including Mayo's NIH IMSD pre-doctoral program, URM summer research programs, and other institutionally-supported diversity education initiatives directed through Mayo's newly-formed Education Office for Diversity. Mayo's successful PREP and IMSD programs celebrate peer mentoring and mutual support between URM students across the summer undergraduate, clinical research, PREP, PhD, and MD/PhD research spectrum. This synergy is critical for student self-efficacy, identity as biomedical research scientists, and elucidation of the training path. PREP progress during the prior funding cycle, together with longitudinal data derived from 13 cohorts of prior PREP students, provides objective evidence of success in promoting graduate training leading to the PhD degree. During the next funding cycle we will maintain our successful program while increasing program evaluation, mentor training, and recruitment. Specific aims: 1. Recruit to Mayo 9 new post-baccalaureate apprentice scientists each year (total of up to 36 over 4 years) for a program of research with intensive enrichment toward individualized student academic and professional development. PREP apprentice scientists may receive one or two years of training, depending on their needs. 2. Maintain Mayo's PREP program where > 75% of post-baccalaureate apprentice scientists enter PhD or MD/PhD programs with a primary interest in laboratory-based or translational research. 3. Enrich Mayo's post-baccalaureate apprentice scientists with skills important for successful initiation and completion of the PhD degree. Each aspect of the Mayo PREP program is designed to enhance students' creativity, self-efficacy, commitment, and purpose as scientists. The program offers activities specifically designed to encourage student interest in research areas related to health disparities. 4. Improve long-term contact and ongoing mentoring of Mayo post-baccalaureate apprentice scientists through graduate school and beyond. We will achieve this goal in synergy with Mayo's NIH-funded IMSD program for minority pre-doctoral students, and with Mayo's Education Office for Diversity. 5. Continue internal and external evaluation with semi-structured interviews ensuring increased utility, feasibility, propriety, and accuracy of Mayo's PREP activities.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research education program will provide 1 or 2 years of support and professional skills development for recent college graduates. The goal is to help students from diverse backgrounds (e.g. ethnic/racial minorities, individuals with disabilities, and individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds) to advance to successful biomedical research careers at the PhD level thus contributing to the diversification of the biomedical research workforce.

"Intervention to Enhance PrEP Uptake and Adherence in a Community-Based Setting     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) refers to daily or intermittent oral administration of antiretroviral drugs designed to protect high-risk HIV-negative individuals from infection. As PrEP is, at present, the most promising biomedical HIV prevention tool, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released interim guidance for health care providers in January 2011, and is expected to soon release detailed public health guidelines for its use. However, in order for PrEP to become an effective prevention tool, three critical factors must be addressed: a) acceptability, i.e., individuals who would benefit from PrEP must know about it and be willing to take it; b) adherence, i.e., individuals who choose to PrEP as a prevention strategy must take the pills as prescribed; and c) implementation, i.e., processes and protocols must be developed to allow for the integration of PrEP delivery and programs into real world settings in a way that is feasible, scalable, and realistic. The proposed project is a two-phase study, conducted in collaboration with the largest LGBT community health provider in New York City (NYC). This project will focus on three specific aims: 1) Identifying social and behavioral factors that are likely to influence PrEP implementation, acceptance, and use/adherence by MSM in NYC, including factors at individual-, community-, and organizational-levels; 2) Examining social and behavioral factors associated with disparities in access to prevention and care services among MSM in NYC that might directly impact PrEP implementation programs and policies; and 3) Evaluating an intervention in which PrEP is introduced, provided, and supported as part of a prevention package delivered in an community health center. To achieve these aims, the project will enroll high-risk MSM to test a two-stage behavioral intervention. First, eligible participants will be randomized to receive either basic information about PrEP availability or a targeted intervention designed to increase PrEP uptake. Second, participants who accept PrEP (regardless of condition) will be randomized to receive either basic adherence information or an enhanced PrEP adherence intervention. Participants will be followed quarterly for 12 months. Outcome variables will include: PrEP uptake, PrEP persistence, PrEP adherence (measured through self-report and biological measures), STI incidence, and self-reported risk behavior. The project is particularly innovative in that it combines an efficacy and effectiveness trial, testing a new intervention in the setting in which it would most feasibly be delivered, and pioneering a new approach to community-based collaboration and study design that can accelerate the pace of implementation science. The proposed project has the potential to exert a sustained and powerful influence not only on the effectiveness of PrEP interventions for MSM, but also on dissemination and scalability of a targeted intervention within community-based settings and in a manner that reduces disparities in access and maximizes cultural competence and acceptability.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a new biomedical approach to HIV prevention with the potential to become a powerful tool. This study identifies social and behavioral factors likely to influence PrEP acceptability and adherence among MSM, and collaborates with a community health center to evaluate a two- stage intervention to improve PrEP uptake, persistence, and adherence. Study findings have the potential to influence dissemination and scalability of a targeted PrEP intervention within community-based settings and in a manner that reduces disparities in access and maximizes cultural competence and acceptability.                    ",Intervention to Enhance PrEP Uptake and Adherence in a Community-Based Setting,8538874,R01AA022067,"['intraoral drug delivery

"KU Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek continuation of the KU Post Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) that has exceeded its goals in the recruitment and training of American Indian (AI) and other underrepresented minorities (URMs). Within the three years since its inception, 23 URMs have been accepted into the program. Over half (13) are AI, and nine attended our long-term partnering tribal college, Haskell Indian Nations University. All 11 scholars that successfully completed the program have entered graduate school. Six are enrolled in doctoral programs, and five are enrolled or have completed masters programs with the potential to continue into PhD programs. Four additional scholars are applying to graduate school, bringing the total of PREP scholars either enrolled in or applying to graduate school to near 65% of the students who enrolled in the program. Continuation of KU PREP will build on these successes and permit refinements that respond to a formative evaluation of the program. Talented PREP scholars with a bachelor's degree who find themselves under-prepared for graduate work will be recruited from Haskell, KU, and other institutions. An individualized student development plan (IDP) will be created for each scholar based on the results of careful academic evaluation and assessments made by skilled professionals. A central focus of the IDP will be research training; consequently, PREP scholars will be Apprentice Scientists, each assigned a KU faculty researcher and a mentoring team. All participating mentors have demonstrated their abilities to work with minority students like those engaged at the University of Kansas. KU's PREP also enhances math, reading and writing, and leadership skills to guarantee scholar success in highly competitive graduate programs. IDPs include coursework in professional writing that enhances the PREP scholars' ability to critique, synthesize, and communicate within their chosen fields. KU Math department faculty work with individual scholars to elevate their quantitative skills to an advanced level appropriate for today's scientific research. All PREP scholars complete a series of seminars in the responsible conduct of research, test taking strategies, applying to graduate school, and professional development workshops that improve their overall qualifications for graduate school. Modifications in response to program evaluation will allow KU PREP to advance at least 75% of its scholars into graduate school with a PhD completion rate of 80%, thereby increasing the number of AI and other URMs within the biomedical research community. NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE  The proposed project will increase the diversity of the scientific community by preparing American Indians and other underrepresented students for graduate study and eventual careers in biomedical research.

"Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of Mount Sinai's Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (Mount Sinai PREP) is to make a significant contribution to increasing the number of biomedical scientists from underrepresented minority groups, disadvantaged backgrounds or those who live with the challenges of disability. We aim to prepare recent college graduates from these targeted groups to enroll and succeed in highly competitive Ph.D. or MD/Ph.D. programs so that they go on to develop independent research careers after their postdoctoral or residency/fellowship training. Now in its 8th year, Mount Sinai PREP has a strong and growing record of application and enrollment of its participants in excellent Ph.D. and MD/Ph.D. programs. Of the 26 who have enrolled in such programs, over 92% have progressed well. They are all supported by fellowships and traineeships, including 12 T32 traineeships and 6 F31 fellowships from NIH. The first Ph.D. awards are occurring with excellent time-lines and records of accomplishment this spring. Mount Sinai PREP has enhanced its recruitment of applicants to promote consistent enrollment of PREP participants whose motivation and levels of academic and research potential support their aspirations for research careers. PREP has also further enhanced its successful program strategies. Central strategies include: (i) ensuring that all PREP participants undertake a mentored research project in which their analytical, conceptual, and technical abilities are fostered; (ii) ensuring that they integrate fully into the laboratory group and culture, increase their ability to use and critique primary research literature and their ability to present their work; (iii) providing individualized help to eliminate gaps, impediments or health issues that might impede success; (iv) fostering the ability of PREP participants to succeed in rigorous doctoral level course-work. Important additional PREP strategies include: (i) acclimatizing the PREP group to the environment of a major academic medical center; (ii) encouraging interest in health and health care disparities through projects and grand rounds of the Center for Multi-Cultural and Community Affairs along with other student groups; (iii) networking them with Mount Sinai PREP alumni, ""Friends/Outside Advisors"" of PREP and other professionals whose stories inspire and advice is worthwhile. We continue to closely monitor, mentor, and interact with Mount Sinai PREP alumni. We enjoy the presence of 12 of them in programs on our campus, and expect some of them to become faculty colleagues and future PREP leaders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The PREP initiative seeks to increase the participation of individuals from underrepresented minority and disadvantaged as well as disabled individuals at the cutting-edge levels of biomedical research. Major benefits to public health will result from diversification of the biomedical research work-force because research practitioners from communities that struggle with negative health and health care disparities are highly motivated to undertake projects that address these disparities and projects that yield new therapies or preventive strategies for major health problems or illness of their communities. Diversification of the research workforce at the professoriate level will also address disparities in access of young people from similar backgrounds to high quality science education, thus increasing the rate of these positive changes.

Diversification of the research  workforce at the professoriate level will also address disparities in access of young people from similar  backgrounds to high quality science education, thus increasing the rate of these positive changes.",Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP),8517735,R25GM064118,"['University Medical Centers ', ' Academic Medical Centers ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' Critiques ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Hand ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Residencies ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Students ', ' Talents ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Traineeship ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Competence ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Time Management ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Activity ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' science education ', ' success ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' doctoral degree ', ' Doctorate Degree ', "" Doctor's Degree "", ' Health Sciences ', ' Measurable ', ' Scholars Program ', ' NCI Scholars Program ', ' Qualifying ', ' Research Training ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Minority ', ' ']",NIGMS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R25,2013,360257,0.3532463038223708
"Arizona State University PREP for Biomedical Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of underrepresented individuals in the biomedical and behavioral sciences is improving, but more significant increases are still needed. Arizona State University (ASU) Biomedical Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) is designed to identify underrepresented baccalaureate graduates with significant potential and commitment to pursue a Ph.D. in these area, but for various reasons do not pursue this goal directly after graduation. ASU Biomedical PREP proposes in this renewal application to continue providing an additional year of preparation beyond the undergraduate degree to help 10 underrepresented graduates smoothly transition into highly competitive biomedical and behavioral graduate programs at ASU and throughout the country. The goal is for participants to successfully complete the Ph.D. and go on to pursue careers as strong investigators in academic or private sectors. The long term goal is to contribute to the development of a strong cohort of scientists that are keenly informed, highly committed and prepared to address important biomedical and behavioral research problems, particularly those that reduce health disparities. The specific goals are to (1) provide a strong intensive individualized mentored research experience, (2) strengthen communication, computational, analytical and critical thinking skills through the research experience, as well as formal and informal activities and (3) provide insight into career options, including information about research focused on elimination of health disparities. PREP students will be recruited from ASU and through contacts with the University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, and other institutions, especially in California and the Southwest. Students will work with the Director, mentor and other faculty to establish an individualized development plan that focuses on mentored research, academic preparation and skills/training activities to strengthen verbal, analytical and critical thinking skills. Participants will interact with graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty through participation in seminars, journal clubs, lab meetings, local graduate symposia, national meetings and a series of Graduate College programs and activities. PREP will be evaluated on a continuing basis by the Director, Advisory Committee, mentors, evaluators and external advisors. The goal of PREP is to encourage and help underrepresented individuals successfully complete Ph.D. graduate programs in the biomedical and behavioral sciences.

"Intervention to Promote PrEP Awareness and Equitable Prescription among Providers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over thirty years into the United States epidemic, social disparities in HIV prevalence persist, with Black Americans, and Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in particular, disproportionately affected. Intensifying HIV prevention efforts in communities of high prevalence as well as maximizing the dissemination and impact of effective interventions are among the top national priorities for addressing HIV.1,2 The proposed training plan in this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) application will provide the essential knowledge and skills that the principal investigator, Sarah K. Calabrese, PhD, needs to launch a productive career in research targeting these public health imperatives. Further, the research conducted throughout the course of this award would contribute meaningfully to the successful delivery of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP, i.e., oral antiretroviral medication for HIV prevention) in real-world clinical practice and could have far-reaching implications for equitable access across social lines. PrEP is a cutting-edge biomedical advancement that received United States Food and Drug Administration approval for prescription in July of 2012, sparking a push for its implementation in health care settings throughout the country. There has been mounting recognition of the need for provider training and education about PrEP3-7 and some discussion of cultural sensitivity being a component thereof,5 but minimal attention paid explicitly to the risk of disparate prescription practices. Documented discrimination in the prescription of antiretroviral medication for treatment purposes as well as preliminary evidence of biases in clinical judgment surrounding PrEP pose a call to action; the proposed research aims to address this call via the development and pilot testing of a single-session, group-based PrEP Awareness + Discrimination Prevention intervention for healthcare providers. The intervention will serve the dual purpose of increasing knowledge about PrEP among providers and averting discriminatory prescription practices using evidence-based strategies derived from social-cognitive psychology. The project will include a comprehensive needs assessment, including eight focus groups with potential PrEP providers from diverse clinical settings (n=48-64), six focus groups with Black MSM at risk for HIV acquisition (i.e., potential PrEP users; n=36-48), key informant interviews with healthcare providers who have experience prescribing PrEP (n=20), and a national quantitative survey of physicians (n=350). The intervention will be pilot tested in a two-armed randomized controlled trial with 80 healthcare providers seeking continuing medical education. The project will yield an intervention manual with detailed curriculum and supporting materials as well as preliminary indicators of intervention feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness, setting the stage for future refinement and evaluation in the context of a larger-scale randomized controlled trial. The training acquired by Dr. Calabrese via this timely and innovative research project, in combination with formal coursework, focused workshops, academic conferences, manuscript preparation, grant-writing, one-on-one mentorship, and other research activities, will target the following three training objectives: (1) to gain mastery in the discipline of social-cognitive psychology on the topics of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination and to obtain training in measurement of implicit bias, (2) to gain expertise in intervention development, implementation, and evaluation, and (3) to enhance statistical analysis skills for application to planned research. Dr. Calabrese will be mentored primarily by John F. Dovidio, PhD, at Yale University, with additional mentoring from Nathan B. Hansen, PhD (Yale University), Kenneth H. Mayer, MD (Harvard Medical School/The Fenway Institute), Joseph R. Betancourt, MD, MPH (Harvard Medical School), and Manya Magnus, PhD, MPH (George Washington University). Dr. Calabrese's training through the proposed K01 award will round out her expertise and fully prepare her for a career as an independent research scientist in the field of HIV prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), a prescription-based daily oral medication for primary prevention of HIV, adds an exciting new option to the growing arsenal of prevention strategies available to individuals at risk for HIV acquisition. As PrEP is introduced into real-world clinical settings, educating potential prescribers about PrEP and ensuring equitable prescription practices are essential given preliminary indicators of racial bias in PrEP-related clinical decision-making. The proposed research aims to develop and pilot test a single-session, group-based intervention for providers to increase their awareness about PrEP and promote equitable prescription practices, ultimately increasing access to PrEP and combating the spread of HIV.",Intervention to Promote PrEP Awareness and Equitable Prescription among Providers,8658641,K01MH103080,"['Acquired Immunologic

"Post-baccalaureate Training in Biomedical Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The majority of research training programs for individuals from underrepresented groups focus only on basic science research. Although critically important, these programs often fail to provide the motivational link between basic science research and improved health. The goal of the Mayo Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) is to increase the number of individuals from underrepresented groups who choose biomedical research careers, especially disease-oriented research. The program assists both those likely to succeed and those for whom the PREP experience may truly be pivotal in their career paths. Our hypothesis is that students from underrepresented groups increasingly choose disease-directed basic or translational research careers when they clearly see the value of this research in improving human health. Mayo's PREP is successful and mature, having been a unique cornerstone of institutional education diversity efforts since Mayo pioneered this program nationally in 1996. Mayo's ongoing commitment to diversity is supported from the highest executive level and has resulted in significant positive changes at the institution. The unique, highly-integrated clinical and biomedical research programs at Mayo provide an ideal environment to foster the career goals of apprentice scientists. Mayo's PhD graduate school, medical school, MSTP training site, and residency program are parts of the famed Mayo Clinic tertiary care center. Sustained funding of the Mayo PREP positively impacts diversity across the Mayo campus. The PREP synergizes with other ongoing Mayo diversity programs, including Mayo's NIH IMSD pre-doctoral program, URM summer research programs, and other institutionally-supported diversity education initiatives directed through Mayo's newly-formed Education Office for Diversity. Mayo's successful PREP and IMSD programs celebrate peer mentoring and mutual support between URM students across the summer undergraduate, clinical research, PREP, PhD, and MD/PhD research spectrum. This synergy is critical for student self-efficacy, identity as biomedical research scientists, and elucidation of the training path. PREP progress during the prior funding cycle, together with longitudinal data derived from 13 cohorts of prior PREP students, provides objective evidence of success in promoting graduate training leading to the PhD degree. During the next funding cycle we will maintain our successful program while increasing program evaluation, mentor training, and recruitment. Specific aims: 1. Recruit to Mayo 9 new post-baccalaureate apprentice scientists each year (total of up to 36 over 4 years) for a program of research with intensive enrichment toward individualized student academic and professional development. PREP apprentice scientists may receive one or two years of training, depending on their needs. 2. Maintain Mayo's PREP program where > 75% of post-baccalaureate apprentice scientists enter PhD or MD/PhD programs with a primary interest in laboratory-based or translational research. 3. Enrich Mayo's post-baccalaureate apprentice scientists with skills important for successful initiation and completion of the PhD degree. Each aspect of the Mayo PREP program is designed to enhance students' creativity, self-efficacy, commitment, and purpose as scientists. The program offers activities specifically designed to encourage student interest in research areas related to health disparities. 4. Improve long-term contact and ongoing mentoring of Mayo post-baccalaureate apprentice scientists through graduate school and beyond. We will achieve this goal in synergy with Mayo's NIH-funded IMSD program for minority pre-doctoral students, and with Mayo's Education Office for Diversity. 5. Continue internal and external evaluation with semi-structured interviews ensuring increased utility, feasibility, propriety, and accuracy of Mayo's PREP activities.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research education program will provide 1 or 2 years of support and professional skills development for recent college graduates. The goal is to help students from diverse backgrounds (e.g. ethnic/racial minorities, individuals with disabilities, and individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds) to advance to successful biomedical research careers at the PhD level thus contributing to the diversification of the biomedical research workforce.

"Intervention to Enhance PrEP Uptake and Adherence in a Community-Based Setting     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) refers to daily or intermittent oral administration of antiretroviral drugs designed to protect high-risk HIV-negative individuals from infection. As PrEP is, at present, the most promising biomedical HIV prevention tool, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released interim guidance for health care providers in January 2011, and is expected to soon release detailed public health guidelines for its use. However, in order for PrEP to become an effective prevention tool, three critical factors must be addressed: a) acceptability, i.e., individuals who would benefit from PrEP must know about it and be willing to take it; b) adherence, i.e., individuals who choose to PrEP as a prevention strategy must take the pills as prescribed; and c) implementation, i.e., processes and protocols must be developed to allow for the integration of PrEP delivery and programs into real world settings in a way that is feasible, scalable, and realistic. The proposed project is a two-phase study, conducted in collaboration with the largest LGBT community health provider in New York City (NYC). This project will focus on three specific aims: 1) Identifying social and behavioral factors that are likely to influence PrEP implementation, acceptance, and use/adherence by MSM in NYC, including factors at individual-, community-, and organizational-levels; 2) Examining social and behavioral factors associated with disparities in access to prevention and care services among MSM in NYC that might directly impact PrEP implementation programs and policies; and 3) Evaluating an intervention in which PrEP is introduced, provided, and supported as part of a prevention package delivered in an community health center. To achieve these aims, the project will enroll high-risk MSM to test a two-stage behavioral intervention. First, eligible participants will be randomized to receive either basic information about PrEP availability or a targeted intervention designed to increase PrEP uptake. Second, participants who accept PrEP (regardless of condition) will be randomized to receive either basic adherence information or an enhanced PrEP adherence intervention. Participants will be followed quarterly for 12 months. Outcome variables will include: PrEP uptake, PrEP persistence, PrEP adherence (measured through self-report and biological measures), STI incidence, and self-reported risk behavior. The project is particularly innovative in that it combines an efficacy and effectiveness trial, testing a new intervention in the setting in which it would most feasibly be delivered, and pioneering a new approach to community-based collaboration and study design that can accelerate the pace of implementation science. The proposed project has the potential to exert a sustained and powerful influence not only on the effectiveness of PrEP interventions for MSM, but also on dissemination and scalability of a targeted intervention within community-based settings and in a manner that reduces disparities in access and maximizes cultural competence and acceptability.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a new biomedical approach to HIV prevention with the potential to become a powerful tool. This study identifies social and behavioral factors likely to influence PrEP acceptability and adherence among MSM, and collaborates with a community health center to evaluate a two- stage intervention to improve PrEP uptake, persistence, and adherence. Study findings have the potential to influence dissemination and scalability of a targeted PrEP intervention within community-based settings and in a manner that reduces disparities in access and

"KU Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek continuation of the KU Post Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) that has exceeded its goals in the recruitment and training of American Indian (AI) and other underrepresented minorities (URMs). Within the three years since its inception, 23 URMs have been accepted into the program. Over half (13) are AI, and nine attended our long-term partnering tribal college, Haskell Indian Nations University. All 11 scholars that successfully completed the program have entered graduate school. Six are enrolled in doctoral programs, and five are enrolled or have completed masters programs with the potential to continue into PhD programs. Four additional scholars are applying to graduate school, bringing the total of PREP scholars either enrolled in or applying to graduate school to near 65% of the students who enrolled in the program. Continuation of KU PREP will build on these successes and permit refinements that respond to a formative evaluation of the program. Talented PREP scholars with a bachelor's degree who find themselves under-prepared for graduate work will be recruited from Haskell, KU, and other institutions. An individualized student development plan (IDP) will be created for each scholar based on the results of careful academic evaluation and assessments made by skilled professionals. A central focus of the IDP will be research training; consequently, PREP scholars will be Apprentice Scientists, each assigned a KU faculty researcher and a mentoring team. All participating mentors have demonstrated their abilities to work with minority students like those engaged at the University of Kansas. KU's PREP also enhances math, reading and writing, and leadership skills to guarantee scholar success in highly competitive graduate programs. IDPs include coursework in professional writing that enhances the PREP scholars' ability to critique, synthesize, and communicate within their chosen fields. KU Math department faculty work with individual scholars to elevate their quantitative skills to an advanced level appropriate for today's scientific research. All PREP scholars complete a series of seminars in the responsible conduct of research, test taking strategies, applying to graduate school, and professional development workshops that improve their overall qualifications for graduate school. Modifications in response to program evaluation will allow KU PREP to advance at least 75% of its scholars into graduate school with a PhD completion rate of 80%, thereby increasing the number of AI and other URMs within the biomedical research community. NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE  The proposed project will increase the diversity of the scientific community by preparing American Indians and other underrepresented students for graduate study and eventual careers in biomedical research. The project will increase the size and diversity of the scientific workforce and increase interest in research regarding  diseases with a high incidence in minority populations, improving both health care and disease prevention in this country.",KU Post-Baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP),8607962,R25GM078441,"['American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Behavior ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Critiques ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Elements ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Faculty ', ' Fellowship ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Immersion ', ' Immersion Investigative Technique ', ' Incidence ', ' Kansas ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Leadership ', ' Math ', ' Mathematics ', ' Mentors ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Paper ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Reading ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Thinking, function ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Competence ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Specialist ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' graduate student ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Undergraduate Degree ', ' Baccalaureate Degree ', "" Bachelor's Degree "", ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Measurable ', ' Scholars Program ', ' NCI Scholars Program ', ' Research Training ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Preparation ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' tribal university ', ' tribal college ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' Secure ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R25,2014,356983,0.2651192337645907
"Yale Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) at Yale University that will provide eight URM baccalaureate graduates with a one-year program of faculty-mentored research training in the biomedical sciences and educational preparation for graduate school admission. The long-term goal of the proposed Yale PREP is to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) students pursuing doctoral studies in the biomedical sciences, especially at Yale. Yale PREP will recruit baccalaureate graduates from a wide range of colleges and universities but especially historically black colleges and universities, Hispanic serving institutions, and the University of Puerto Rico, as well as through an exciting new partnership between Yale and Chaminade University of Honolulu, a Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander serving institution. The goal of Yale PREP is to provide program participants with a foundation of knowledge, experiences, and skills necessary to be successful graduate students. Specific objectives for program participants are: 1) To experience life as a biomedical graduate student at a major research university, taking courses and receiving mentoring alongside first year PhD students. 2) To conduct, under supervision of a faculty mentor, an independent research project for which they ultimately take responsibility for planning and executing experiments, including formulating and testing hypotheses. 3) To study an educational curriculum that consists of GRE preparation, graduate school and career workshops, a research literature seminar course, a journal club covering health-disparities research, Yale courses, and research presentations. Program participants will devote 75% of their time to independent research and 25% to the educational curriculum. Expected outcomes for Yale PREP participants include improved laboratory skills, problem-solving abilities, biomedical research knowledge, and presentation skills. They will also demonstrate an increased commitment to biomedical research, which should ultimately culminate in the pursuit of the PhD degree. The impact of the proposed Yale PREP will be to expand the pool of exceptional doctoral students from underrepresented groups in the biomedical sciences and thus the diversity of perspectives needed to address important problems in human health and disease, including health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Yale University proposes to establish a Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) that will provide underrepresented minority baccalaureate graduates with faculty-mentored research training in the biomedical sciences and educational preparation for graduate school admission.

"PrEP for Black MSM: Community-Based Ethnography and Clinic-Based Treatment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, men who have sex with men (MSM) comprise the group most severely affected by the HIV epidemic: 61% of all new infections in 2009 occurred in this population. Black MSM experience an even more disproportionate burden of infections, with prevalence of 28% in contrast to 16% in White, non- Latino MSM. HIV-infected Black MSM are also more likely than White MSM to receive an HIV diagnosis at  their first testing experience, suggesting that they are less likely than other group to benefit from HIV  prevention and control services. Clearly, the reduction of HIV-related disparities in Black MSM is a national health priority, essential to the success of efforts to contol and prevent HIV/AIDS as articulated in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), which has been shown to reduce acquisition among MSM, could play a critical role in the next generation of combination prevention interventions. Before  PrEP is scaled up on a national level, however, critical questions must be answered regarding both the  community-level factors that will shape uptake of and adherence to PrEP among Black MSM and the optimal  clinical package for delivering PrEP in a way that is both scalable and effective.   There is, moreover, a relationship between the broader social needs and perceptions of Black MSM and that clinical care package, and so we propose a multi-method study that incorporates community-based ethnography and an intervention in a community primary care clinic.  The community-based ethnographic  research will consist of institutional mapping, key informant interviews, ethnographic interviews with a  systematic ethnographic sample, participant observation, and analysis of material culture. Drawing on the concepts of social risk, life projects, and social networks, we will explore the structural and cultural factors that shape men's sexual relationships, health systems engagement, and knowledge attitudes and practices related to HIV prevention in general and PrEP in particular. Findings from the ethnographic research will provide urgently needed information regarding community-contextual factors relevant to designing combination prevention interventions that include PrEP, and will lay the groundwork for the randomized controlled trial for PrEP for Black MSM in a community-based clinic. The clinic-based research will randomize eligible HIV- negative Black MSM to an enhanced versus standard PrEP package of care and compare their effectiveness on adherence with PrEP and reduction in sexual risk behaviors. The RCT will generate critical information regarding the acceptability of PrEP for Black MSM in a community clinical context, adherence to PrEP under non-experimental conditions, health providers' experiences with PrEP, and the impact of PrEP on sexual risk practices.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Black Men who have sex with men (MSM) have among the highest rates of new HIV infections of any group in the United States, and developing effective HIV prevention interventions that work with this group is a critical element of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. We propose to carry out community-based research that will  explore factors relevant to how Black MSM might engage with PrEP, and then to conduct a study in a community primary care clinic to compare two packages for providing PrEP. Together these efforts will provide critical information for building more effective HIV prevention interventions or this at-risk population.                      ",PrEP for Black MSM: Community-Based Ethnography and Clinic-Based Treatment,8695490,R01MH098723,"['Affect ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Couples ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Maps ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' New York City ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' base ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' uptake ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Pill ', ' pill (pharmacologic) ', ' Population Group ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Social Concepts ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical trial ', ' pre-clinical trial ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' preclinical study ', ' sexual relationship ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' primary care setting ', ' social science research ', ' arm ', ' ']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2014,621810,0.22388926809141732
"Arizona State University PREP for Biomedical Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of underrepresented individuals in the biomedical and behavioral sciences is improving, but more significant increases are still needed. Arizona State University (ASU) Biomedical Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) is designed to identify underrepresented baccalaureate graduates with significant potential and commitment to pursue a Ph.D. in these area, but for various reasons do not pursue this goal directly after graduation. ASU Biomedical PREP proposes in this renewal application to continue providing an additional year of preparation beyond the undergraduate degree to help 10 underrepresented graduates smoothly transition into highly competitive biomedical and behavioral graduate programs at ASU and throughout the country. The goal is for participants to successfully complete the Ph.D. and go on to pursue careers as strong investigators in academic or private sectors. The long term goal is to contribute to the development of a strong cohort of scientists that are keenly informed, highly committed and prepared to address important biomedical and behavioral research problems, particularly those that reduce health disparities. The specific goals are to (1) provide a strong intensive individualized mentored research experience, (2) strengthen communication, computational, analytical and critical thinking skills through the research experience, as well as formal and informal activities and (3) provide insight into career options, including information about research focused on elimination of health disparities. PREP students will be recruited from ASU and through contacts with the University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, and other institutions, especially in California and the Southwest. Students will work with the Director, mentor and other faculty to establish an individualized development plan that focuses on mentored research, academic preparation and skills/training activities to strengthen verbal, analytical and critical thinking skills.

"Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of Mount Sinai's Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (Mount Sinai PREP) is to make a significant contribution to increasing the number of biomedical scientists from underrepresented minority groups, socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds or those who are challenged by a disability. We aim to prepare recent college graduates from these groups to enroll and succeed in competitive PhD and MD/PhD programs, and then complete postdoctoral or residency/fellowship training before entering careers in which they can contribute to biomedical research, drug development, or research on health and health care disparities. Now in its 12th year, Mount Sinai PREP alumni have garnered 12 PhD degrees, with 2 of those students ready to complete their MD/PhD training this May, while completion of 4 more PhD degrees is also expected by the summer. During their pre-doctoral work, 20 Mount Sinai PREP alumni were supported by traineeships on T32 training grants, 9 were awarded F31 fellowships and many other prestigious fellowships were obtained, e.g. 3 UNCF-Merck awards. All the PREP alumni who completed PhD programs to-date have entered postdoctoral work: 7 in academic settings, with prestigious fellowships including the CDC Infectious Disease Fellowship and HHMI Life Sciences Award~ 1 at NIAID, with an IRTA award ~ 1 at the FDA with an FDA Commissioner's award, who is now a Pharmaceuticals Reviewer on the FDA staff ~ and 1 who pursued postdoctoral work at Glaxo-Smith-Kline. Enhanced recruitment efforts, program evaluation (self-evaluation and external evaluation) and ongoing program development have enabled the program to achieve and benefit from a large applicant pool and maintain an accept/enter ratio between 1 and 1.2. Central strategies of Mount Sinai PREP include the following. We strive to ensure that each PREP scholar has a laboratory placement with an excellent faculty research mentor, supportive peer mentors, and an opportunity to work on a cutting-edge project of interest that develops analytical, conceptual and technical skills. We expect PREP scholars to integrate into laboratory activities such as lab meetings, journal clubs, and parties. They are also expected to integrate into the PREP community and activities such as workshops that build research, presentation, writing skills, or initiate a discussion of psychosocial well-being. PREP activities also include peer-led WIPs/J. Clubs, lunches with advisors and guests with interesting paths to share, and encounters with PREP alumni. We further promote their integration into activities of the PhD, MD/PhD and master's student community of the Graduate School, which whom PREP scholars interact in courses, seminars, and both outreach and social activities. The Program joins a Regional PREP Symposium, at which the PREP scholars present their work and network. The Program will also follow up on a well-received 10 year Reunion-Retreat with a Reunion-Retreat every 5 years. The Program maintains close touch with PREP alumni through emails, reunions, alumni visits to speak to current PREP scholars and Program Director visits to them during travel to a nearby meeting.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mount Sinai PREP seeks to increase the participation of individuals from underrepresented minority groups and socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals at the cutting-edge levels of biomedical research, and seeks to accommodate individuals with disabilities. Research shows that diverse groups function more effectively and innovatively than groups lacking diversity. Major benefits to public health will result from furthe diversification of the biomedical work-force and a diverse work-force will increased engagement and expert focus on problems related to health and health care disparities, which are in need of such focus.            ",Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP),8636826,R25GM064118,"['Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Be element ', ' Beryllium ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Fellowship ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Interviewer ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Residencies ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Schools ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Self Assessment (Psychology) ', ' Self-Evaluation Programs ', ' statistics ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Traineeship ', ' Travel ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Activity ', ' Development Plans ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' instrument ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Reaction ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' peer ', ' empowerment ', ' outreach ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' drug development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Commit ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Institution ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Measurable ', ' Scholars Program ', ' NCI Scholars Program ', ' NIAID ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' F31 Award ', ' Predoctoral Individual National Research Service Award ', ' Qualifying ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIGMS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R25,2014,404696,0.38870451486211055
"Accelerating PrEP Diffusion through Network Change Agents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early evidence exists of disparities in Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) knowledge, PrEP seeking behavior and PrEP adoption based on race. Black communities and in particular, younger Black MSM (YBMSM) have limited PrEP engagement. Evidence of few Black PrEP users is of concern with <15% of PrEP clients in Washington DC and New York City identifying as Black in PrEP demonstration/implementation projects. This finding is in the context of YBMSM leading new infections in these cities (and nationally). Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of PrEP clients nationally are privately insured and older - two characteristics incongruous with current HIV incidence. So while PrEP is promising; real-world PrEP use faces major implementation challenges.  Over the past two decades, the most widely used network-based intervention for HIV prevention has been the opinion leader (OL) model or variants of it. This approach includes training popular members from a target population to promote HIV prevention messages through interpersonal communication. The effectiveness of the OL model can be limited by several factors, including: heterogeneous and overlapping networks, inadequate network assessments, and the OL's public position which often requires she/he maintain conformity to the status quo. Consequently, identifying those who connect across groups of otherwise disconnected individuals (hereafter ""network bridges""), may be an alternative and efficient way to use network information to accelerate behavior change as has been demonstrated in other settings.  This proposal moves beyond traditional OL and peer outreach models by aiming to recruit change agents based upon their structural position in a social network, in this case Facebook, in order to accelerate diffusion of PrEP. This framework is further important for measuring the potential of bridging network members as they may be the earliest innovation adopters and are likely to be more willing to challenge the existing status quo. Such bridges have structural advantages that have led to increased communication, innovation and efficiency in workplace settings; however, such bridging impact in public health contexts is understudied.  We propose to address these knowledge gaps and intervene by building upon two recent studies through three phases. Phase I expands the use of Facebook for accurately characterizing a YBMSM network using a hybrid network data collection approach developed and implemented by the PI. Phase II identifies, recruits and trains change agents based upon their structural position (e.g., bridging, central, or other positions). Phase III measures and evaluates three stages of PrEP diffusion as promoted by the same agents. Our interdisciplinary team has expertise with PrEP implementation (Schneider), bridging metrics (Valente), intervention training (Bouris, Hill), social network analysis (Schneider, Valente, Goodreau), ethics (Karnik) and diffusion (Valente, Khanna). The proposed research will advance current understandings of diffusion of PrEP innovation and if successful, is structured to impact urban HIV epicenters with alarming rates of HIV infection in YBMSM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed intervention will utilize bridging network members within a large young Black MSM Facebook network to accelerate the diffusion of PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) knowledge and early adoption in this same network. If successful, this project has the potential to translate a highly efficacious biomedical intervention into an impactful one in a sub-population at highest risk for HIV infection in the United States.                    ",Accelerating PrEP Diffusion through Network Change Agents,8990690,R01AI120700,"['Adoption ', ' Behavior ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Client ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diffusion ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of Mount Sinai's Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (Mount Sinai PREP) is to make a significant contribution to increasing the number of biomedical scientists from underrepresented minority groups, socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds or those who are challenged by a disability. We aim to prepare recent college graduates from these groups to enroll and succeed in competitive PhD and MD/PhD programs, and then complete postdoctoral or residency/fellowship training before entering careers in which they can contribute to biomedical research, drug development, or research on health and health care disparities. Now in its 12th year, Mount Sinai PREP alumni have garnered 12 PhD degrees, with 2 of those students ready to complete their MD/PhD training this May, while completion of 4 more PhD degrees is also expected by the summer. During their pre-doctoral work, 20 Mount Sinai PREP alumni were supported by traineeships on T32 training grants, 9 were awarded F31 fellowships and many other prestigious fellowships were obtained, e.g. 3 UNCF-Merck awards. All the PREP alumni who completed PhD programs to-date have entered postdoctoral work: 7 in academic settings, with prestigious fellowships including the CDC Infectious Disease Fellowship and HHMI Life Sciences Award~ 1 at NIAID, with an IRTA award ~ 1 at the FDA with an FDA Commissioner's award, who is now a Pharmaceuticals Reviewer on the FDA staff ~ and 1 who pursued postdoctoral work at Glaxo-Smith-Kline. Enhanced recruitment efforts, program evaluation (self-evaluation and external evaluation) and ongoing program development have enabled the program to achieve and benefit from a large applicant pool and maintain an accept/enter ratio between 1 and 1.2. Central strategies of Mount Sinai PREP include the following. We strive to ensure that each PREP scholar has a laboratory placement with an excellent faculty research mentor, supportive peer mentors, and an opportunity to work on a cutting-edge project of interest that develops analytical, conceptual and technical skills. We expect PREP scholars to integrate into laboratory activities such as lab meetings, journal clubs, and parties. They are also expected to integrate into the PREP community and activities such as workshops that build research, presentation, writing skills, or initiate a discussion of psychosocial well-being. PREP activities also include peer-led WIPs/J. Clubs, lunches with advisors and guests with interesting paths to share, and encounters with PREP alumni. We further promote their integration into activities of the PhD, MD/PhD and master's student community of the Graduate School, which whom PREP scholars interact in courses, seminars, and both outreach and social activities. The Program joins a Regional PREP Symposium, at which the PREP scholars present their work and network. The Program will also follow up on a well-received 10 year Reunion-Retreat with a Reunion-Retreat every 5 years. The Program maintains close touch with PREP alumni through emails, reunions, alumni visits to speak to current PREP scholars and Program Director visits to them during travel to a nearby meeting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mount Sinai PREP seeks to increase the participation of individuals from underrepresented minority groups and socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals at the cutting-edge levels of biomedical research, and seeks to accommodate individuals with disabilities. Research shows that diverse groups function more effectively and innovatively than groups lacking diversity. Major benefits to public health will result from furthe diversification of the biomedical work-force and a diverse work-force will increased engagement and expert focus on problems related to health and health care disparities, which are in need of such focus.",Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP),8904671,R25GM064118,"['Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Be element ', ' Beryllium ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Fellowship ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' Interviewer ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Residencies ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Schools ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Self Assessment (Psychology) ', ' Self-Evaluation Programs ', ' statistics ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Traineeship ', ' Travel ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Activity ', ' Development Plans ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' instrument ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Reaction ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' peer ', ' empowerment ', ' outreach ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' drug development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Institution ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Measurable ', ' Scholars Program ', ' NCI Scholars Program ', ' NIAID ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' F31 Award ', ' Predoctoral Individual National Research Service Award ', ' Qualifying ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' ']",NIGMS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R25,2015,404696,0.38870451486211055

"Intervention to Promote PrEP Awareness and Equitable Prescription among Providers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over thirty years into the United States epidemic, social disparities in HIV prevalence persist, with Black Americans, and Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in particular, disproportionately affected. Intensifying HIV prevention efforts in communities of high prevalence as well as maximizing the dissemination and impact of effective interventions are among the top national priorities for addressing HIV.1,2 The proposed training plan in this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) application will provide the essential knowledge and skills that the principal investigator, Sarah K. Calabrese, PhD, needs to launch a productive career in research targeting these public health imperatives. Further, the research conducted throughout the course of this award would contribute meaningfully to the successful delivery of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP, i.e., oral antiretroviral medication for HIV prevention) in real-world clinical practice and could have far-reaching implications for equitable access across social lines. PrEP is a cutting-edge biomedical advancement that received United States Food and Drug Administration approval for prescription in July of 2012, sparking a push for its implementation in health care settings throughout the country. There has been mounting recognition of the need for provider training and education about PrEP3-7 and some discussion of cultural sensitivity being a component thereof,5 but minimal attention paid explicitly to the risk of disparate prescription practices. Documented discrimination in the prescription of antiretroviral medication for treatment purposes as well as preliminary evidence of biases in clinical judgment surrounding PrEP pose a call to action; the proposed research aims to address this call via the development and pilot testing of a single-session, group-based PrEP Awareness + Discrimination Prevention intervention for healthcare providers. The intervention will serve the dual purpose of increasing knowledge about PrEP among providers and averting discriminatory prescription practices using evidence-based strategies derived from social-cognitive psychology. The project will include a comprehensive needs assessment, including eight focus groups with potential PrEP providers from diverse clinical settings (n=48-64), six focus groups with Black MSM at risk for HIV acquisition (i.e., potential PrEP users; n=36-48), key informant interviews with healthcare providers who have experience prescribing PrEP (n=20), and a national quantitative survey of physicians (n=350). The intervention will be pilot tested in a two-armed randomized controlled trial with 80 healthcare providers seeking continuing medical education. The project will yield an intervention manual with detailed curriculum and supporting materials as well as preliminary indicators of intervention feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness, setting the stage for future refinement and evaluation in the context of a larger-scale randomized controlled trial. The training acquired by Dr. Calabrese via this timely and innovative research project, in combination with formal coursework, focused workshops, academic conferences, manuscript preparation, grant-writing, one-on-one mentorship, and other research activities, will target the following three training objectives: (1) to gain mastery in the discipline of social-cognitive psychology on the topics of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination and to obtain training in measurement of implicit bias, (2) to gain expertise in intervention development, implementation, and evaluation, and (3) to enhance statistical analysis skills for application to planned research. Dr. Calabrese will be mentored primarily by John F. Dovidio, PhD, at Yale University, with additional mentoring from Nathan B. Hansen, PhD (Yale University), Kenneth H. Mayer, MD (Harvard Medical School/The Fenway Institute), Joseph R. Betancourt, MD, MPH (Harvard Medical School), and Manya Magnus, PhD, MPH (George Washington University). Dr. Calabrese's training through the proposed K01 award will round out her expertise and fully prepare her for a career as an independent research scientist in the field of HIV prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), a prescription-based daily oral medication for primary prevention of HIV, adds an exciting new option to the growing arsenal of prevention strategies available to individuals at risk for HIV acquisition. As PrEP is introduced into real-world clinical settings, educating potential prescribers about PrEP and ensuring equitable prescription practices are essential given preliminary indicators of racial bias in PrEP-related clinical decision-making. The proposed research aims to develop and pilot test a single-session, group-based intervention for providers to increase their awareness about PrEP and promote equitable prescription practices, ultimately increasing access to PrEP and combating the spread of HIV.",Intervention to Promote PrEP Awareness and Equitable Prescription among Providers,8842719,K01MH103080,"['Acquired Immunologic

"Intervention to Enhance PrEP Uptake and Adherence in a Community-Based Setting DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) refers to daily or intermittent oral administration of antiretroviral drugs designed to protect high-risk HIV-negative individuals from infection. As PrEP is, at present, the most promising biomedical HIV prevention tool, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released interim guidance for health care providers in January 2011, and is expected to soon release detailed public health guidelines for its use. However, in order for PrEP to become an effective prevention tool, three critical factors must be addressed: a) acceptability, i.e., individuals who would benefit from PrEP must know about it and be willing to take it; b) adherence, i.e., individuals who choose to PrEP as a prevention strategy must take the pills as prescribed; and c) implementation, i.e., processes and protocols must be developed to allow for the integration of PrEP delivery and programs into real world settings in a way that is feasible, scalable, and realistic. The proposed project is a two-phase study, conducted in collaboration with the largest LGBT community health provider in New York City (NYC). This project will focus on three specific aims: 1) Identifying social and behavioral factors that are likely to influence PrEP implementation, acceptance, and use/adherence by MSM in NYC, including factors at individual-, community-, and organizational-levels; 2) Examining social and behavioral factors associated with disparities in access to prevention and care services among MSM in NYC that might directly impact PrEP implementation programs and policies; and 3) Evaluating an intervention in which PrEP is introduced, provided, and supported as part of a prevention package delivered in an community health center. To achieve these aims, the project will enroll high-risk MSM to test a two-stage behavioral intervention. First, eligible participants will be randomized to receive either basic information about PrEP availability or a targeted intervention designed to increase PrEP uptake. Second, participants who accept PrEP (regardless of condition) will be randomized to receive either basic adherence information or an enhanced PrEP adherence intervention. Participants will be followed quarterly for 12 months. Outcome variables will include: PrEP uptake, PrEP persistence, PrEP adherence (measured through self-report and biological measures), STI incidence, and self-reported risk behavior. The project is particularly innovative in that it combines an efficacy and effectiveness trial, testing a new intervention in the setting in which it would most feasibly be delivered, and pioneering a new approach to community-based collaboration and study design that can accelerate the pace of implementation science. The proposed project has the potential to exert a sustained and powerful influence not only on the effectiveness of PrEP interventions for MSM, but also on dissemination and scalability of a targeted intervention within community-based settings and in a manner that reduces disparities in access and maximizes cultural competence and acceptability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a new biomedical approach to HIV prevention with the potential to become a powerful tool. This study identifies social and behavioral factors likely to influence PrEP acceptability and adherence among MSM, and collaborates with a community health center to evaluate a two- stage intervention to improve PrEP uptake, persistence, and adherence. Study findings have the potential to influence dissemination and scalability of a targeted PrEP intervention within community-based settings and in a manner that reduces disparities in access and maximizes cultural competence and acceptability.",Intervention to Enhance PrEP Uptake and Adherence in a Community-Based Setting,8891315,R01AA022067,"['intraoral drug delivery ', ' Oral Drug

"Developing an Implementation Program to Optimize Uptake of HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis among Black Women in Primary Care Settings ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Charlene Flash is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator and national leader in eliminating health care disparities in HIV. She strives to master the development and evaluation of theory-driven approaches to bio-behavioral HIV prevention, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), among at-risk Black women. Dr. Flash will accomplish this goal through patient-oriented research, formal mentoring by recognized experts (Drs. Thomas Giordano, Kenneth Mayer, Rivet Amico, Jeffrey Cully and Adaora Adimora) and advanced training in behavioral science, mixed-methodology, and implementation science.  The applicant's K23 research goal is to develop an HIV prevention program for Black women in primary care settings that facilitates access to PrEP. The overall hypothesis is that modifiable patient and provider features influence uptake of biobehavioral prevention. Understanding the influence of these features on CDC HIV PrEP guideline uptake can guide design of an innovative, culturally relevant HIV prevention program. The Program's objective is for Black women engaged in primary care settings to be screened for risk, made aware of PrEP and be able to access PrEP via an informed and equipped provider if the patient is both high risk and interested. Addressing four NIMH high priority areas, this research integrates behavioral and biomedical approaches, incorporates context, and uses implementation science in vulnerable populations.  The first specific aim is to use patient and provider surveys and interviews, grounded in the PARiHS implementation framework, to assess how Black women and their providers approach sexual health, assess HIV risk, and perceive PrEP. The second aim is to develop a PrEP Implementation Program to increase HIV risk assessments among Black women and appropriate PrEP uptake among those at-risk. We will develop and iteratively revise a clinical algorithm to increase HIV risk assessments, PrEP discourse, and PrEP prescribing when appropriate. The algorithm will be informed by data from AIM 1, existing literature, and input from a Multidisciplinary Advisory Board that includes experts in PrEP and implementation science, clinical providers, and at risk Black women patients. The third specific aim is to use a type 3 effectiveness-implementation hybrid design with pre-post evaluation to pilot and evaluate the PrEP Implementation Program in a primary care clinic that serves Black women of low socioeconomic status living in a high HIV incidence zip code.  As additional oral, topical and injectable chemoprophylaxis agents emerge, this work will facilitate their integration into existing health care structures. This research will expand upon the principal investigator's current skills and past work, take advantage of an outstanding research and mentoring environment, and develop an independent researcher whose work decreases HIV incidence among Black women.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: CDC recently issued guidelines supporting use of a highly effective biomedical intervention to prevent HIV transmission, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Although Black women in the United States bear disproportionate burden of HIV, limited data exist on how patient and provider features may influence their use of PrEP. This proposal is innovative in its use of implementation science to map out a step-wise approach to increasing PrEP access in a marginalized under-studied population.                ",Developing an Implementation Program to Optimize Uptake of HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis among Black Women in Primary Care Settings,9063893,K23MH109358,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Belief ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Elements ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Records ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' statistics ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Injectable ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' uptake ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' Population Study ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' implementation research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' safety net ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Chemoprophylaxis ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary care setting ', ' ']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K23,2015,170807,0.30524552571506636
"PrEP for Black MSM: Community-Based Ethnography and Clinic-Based Treatment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the United States, men who have sex with men (MSM) comprise the group most severely affected by the HIV epidemic: 61% of all new infections in 2009 occurred in this population. Black MSM experience an even more disproportionate burden of infections, with prevalence of 28% in contrast to 16% in White, non- Latino MSM. HIV-infected Black MSM are also more likely than White MSM to receive an HIV diagnosis at  their first testing experience, suggesting that they are less likely than other group to benefit from HIV  prevention and control services. Clearly, the reduction of HIV-related disparities in Black MSM is a national health priority, essential to the success of efforts to contol and prevent HIV/AIDS as articulated in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), which has been shown to reduce acquisition among MSM, could play a critical role in the next generation of combination prevention interventions. Before  PrEP is scaled up on a national level, however, critical questions must be answered regarding both the  community-level factors that will shape uptake of and adherence to PrEP among Black MSM and the optimal  clinical package for delivering PrEP in a way that is both scalable and effective.   There is, moreover, a relationship between the broader social needs and perceptions of Black MSM and that clinical care package, and so we propose a multi-method study that incorporates community-based ethnography and an intervention in a community primary care clinic.  The community-based ethnographic  research will consist of institutional mapping, key informant interviews, ethnographic interviews with a  systematic ethnographic sample, participant observation, and analysis of material culture. Drawing on the concepts of social risk, life projects, and social networks, we will explore the structural and cultural factors that shape men's sexual relationships, health systems engagement, and knowledge attitudes and practices related to HIV prevention in general and PrEP in particular. Findings from the ethnographic research will provide urgently needed information regarding community-contextual factors relevant to designing combination prevention interventions that include PrEP, and will lay the groundwork for the randomized controlled trial for PrEP for Black MSM in a community-based clinic. The clinic-based research will randomize eligible HIV- negative Black MSM to an enhanced versus standard PrEP package of care and compare their effectiveness on adherence with PrEP and reduction in sexual risk behaviors. The RCT will generate critical information regarding the acceptability of PrEP for Black MSM in a community clinical context, adherence to PrEP under non-experimental conditions, health providers' experiences with PrEP, and the impact of PrEP on sexual risk practices. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Black Men who have sex with men (MSM) have among the highest rates of new HIV infections of any group in the United States, and developing effective HIV prevention interventions that work with this group is a critical element of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. We propose to carry out community-based research that will  explore factors relevant to how Black MSM might engage with PrEP, and then to conduct a study in a community primary care clinic to compare two packages for providing PrEP.

"UMB Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of Ph.D. students from diverse backgrounds is acutely underrepresented in biomedical and behavioral sciences in the United States despite the growing proportions of minorities in the population. Through participation in several underrepresented minority (UR)-focused mentoring programs, the Science Training for Advancing Biomedical Research (STAR)-PREP director brings unique insights (from a mentee's perspective) and a great understanding of the attributes required for being a successful mentor. This STAR- PREP is designed to provide aspiring UR biomedical scientists with a specialized but comprehensive training plan. Highly functional and dynamic individual development plans (IDP) will be employed to address the Scholars' weaknesses and strengthen their skills to increase their competitiveness leading to acceptance into top-notch Ph.D. or M.D.-Ph.D. programs. We will take advantage of ongoing interactions with local UR- centered undergraduate programs and with various established programs including T32 grants on campus by incorporating into IDPs regular participation in T32-funded training activities. Our hypothesis is that active participation in an integrated multidimensional research, clinical and mentored research training program coupled with innovations in academic development will result in greater than 75% of PREP Scholars pursuing biomedical research careers. Aim 1 is to ensure an outstanding biomedical research experience to build and refine the STAR-PREP Scholar's research skills. This will be accomplished through use of a diverse community of outstanding faculty and students, state-of-the-art technologies and innovations in interdisciplinary education and training in an atmosphere that explicitly emphasizes excellence and biomedical research. Aim 2 is to strengthen and expand the STAR-PREP Scholar's academic portfolio to facilitate acceptance into a top-notch graduate program. This aim will also support and guide the PREP Scholar thru every step of the graduate school application process, prepare the Scholar for the GRE test and provide direct experience in select Ph.D. courses. Through Aim 3, we will provide a set of high- quality professional development activities individualized for each STAR-PREP Scholar. PREP Scholars will participate in a variety of research poster presentation forums, scientific writing workshops, diversity seminars and attend/present at a national science conference. Aim 4 will provide a continuous dynamic mentoring and community-building research-centered experience. Through this aim we propose to establish a sense of community through social and academic activities between Scholars, mentors and Ph.D. students. The success of each of our aims will be regularly assessed through individual diagnostic assessment tools administered by internal and external evaluators to ensure a positive and meaningful experience to successfully transition Scholars to graduate programs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The STAR-PREP is intended to augment scientific education and research experience of underrepresented minority postbaccalaureates and the number of students that become accepted into biomedical-related Ph.D. or M.D.-Ph.D. programs and careers.            ",UMB Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program,9000921,R25GM113262,"['earth atmosphere ', ' Atmosphere ', ' planetary Atmosphere ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Grant ', ' Maryland ', ' Mentors ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' notch protein ', ' notch receptors ', ' notch ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Diagnostic ', ' posters ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' skills ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' social ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' M.D. ', ' Doctor of Medicine ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Research Training ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Fellowship Program ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' minority health ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' public health relevance ', ' Interdisciplinary Education ', ' Interdisciplinary Learning ', ' underrepresented minority student ', ' under-represented minority student ', ' URM student ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' community building ', ' education research ', ' mentoring community ', ' minority undergraduate ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R25,2016,284941,0.15133924789113615

"Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of Mount Sinai's Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (Mount Sinai PREP) is to make a significant contribution to increasing the number of biomedical scientists from underrepresented minority groups, socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds or those who are challenged by a disability. We aim to prepare recent college graduates from these groups to enroll and succeed in competitive PhD and MD/PhD programs, and then complete postdoctoral or residency/fellowship training before entering careers in which they can contribute to biomedical research, drug development, or research on health and health care disparities. Now in its 12th year, Mount Sinai PREP alumni have garnered 12 PhD degrees, with 2 of those students ready to complete their MD/PhD training this May, while completion of 4 more PhD degrees is also expected by the summer. During their pre-doctoral work, 20 Mount Sinai PREP alumni were supported by traineeships on T32 training grants, 9 were awarded F31 fellowships and many other prestigious fellowships were obtained, e.g. 3 UNCF-Merck awards. All the PREP alumni who completed PhD programs to-date have entered postdoctoral work: 7 in academic settings, with prestigious fellowships including the CDC Infectious Disease Fellowship and HHMI Life Sciences Award~ 1 at NIAID, with an IRTA award ~ 1 at the FDA with an FDA Commissioner's award, who is now a Pharmaceuticals Reviewer on the FDA staff ~ and 1 who pursued postdoctoral work at Glaxo-Smith-Kline. Enhanced recruitment efforts, program evaluation (self-evaluation and external evaluation) and ongoing program development have enabled the program to achieve and benefit from a large applicant pool and maintain an accept/enter ratio between 1 and 1.2. Central strategies of Mount Sinai PREP include the following. We strive to ensure that each PREP scholar has a laboratory placement with an excellent faculty research mentor, supportive peer mentors, and an opportunity to work on a cutting-edge project of interest that develops analytical, conceptual and technical skills. We expect PREP scholars to integrate into laboratory activities such as lab meetings, journal clubs, and parties. They are also expected to integrate into the PREP community and activities such as workshops that build research, presentation, writing skills, or initiate a discussion of psychosocial well-being. PREP activities also include peer-led WIPs/J. Clubs, lunches with advisors and guests with interesting paths to share, and encounters with PREP alumni. We further promote their integration into activities of the PhD, MD/PhD and master's student community of the Graduate School, which whom PREP scholars interact in courses, seminars, and both outreach and social activities.

"Developing a Women-Focused PrEP Intervention for HIV Prevention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV epidemic among women in the United States (US) is a major public health issue and Black and Hispanic women disproportionately affected. Many women at high risk for acquiring HIV infection are not aware of an effective HIV prevention option. An oral antiretroviral medication is now available by prescription for pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Oral PrEP is an efficacious, self-administered, woman-controlled, HIV prevention product. There is a wide gap between recommended use of this effective biomedical HIV prevention method and actual care for women at high risk for acquiring HIV - a gap that needs to be closed in order to avoid worsening already glaring HIV health disparities among women in the US. Alarmingly, there are currently no interventions in the US to promote PrEP uptake among women. The long term goal is to develop effective approaches to support PrEP use and reduce HIV acquisition among high risk women and thereby reduce HIV health disparities. We propose that a theory-based, contextually relevant behavioral intervention combined with linkage to health care and social services, with text message support for adherence, would be feasible and acceptable and could improve PrEP uptake among high risk women. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate an intervention to promote PrEP uptake. Since varying HIV prevention public policy landscapes may also be a factor influencing PrEP uptake, this study will be conducted in two large metropolitan areas with local HIV rates that greatly exceed the national average but with different PrEP public policy and access landscapes. The aims are to : 1.Conduct formative research (40 in-depth interviews and 102 surveys) to identify the association of social-cognitive characteristics, including pre-disposing (e.g., PrEP knowledge, attitudes, norms, self-efficacy and beliefs), enabling (e.g., perceived access to care) and need (perceived HIV risk, risk compensation) with intention of PrEP uptake (initiate, adhere) and assess how these factors are influenced by relevant background factors (e.g., socio-demographics, resources, vulnerability factors). 2. Use findings from Aim 1 to develop an individually-tailored intervention for women to promote PrEP uptake behaviors (initiate, adhere), connect to local PrEP providers, link to community resources that address personal and social barriers to PrEP uptake, and provide a text-message reminder system to support PrEP adherence. 3. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention in a pilot trial (n= 80). The secondary outcomes are to: a) examine PrEP uptake intention & behavior; b) evaluate satisfaction in accessing health care for PrEP, comparing the two sites, and in using a text-message reminder system to support PrEP adherence. Our novel approach combines proven health promotion strategies, linkage to care and technology for substantive impact. This research will advance our understanding of bio-behavioral HIV prevention strategies in heavily affected communities within different PrEP policy and access landscapes. .         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed research is relevant to public health because it will improve understanding of the factors that affect uptake of currently underutilized but potentially life-saving services and offers an intervention to close the gap between optimal and typical care. The project is relevant to the NIH Plan for HIV-Related Research because it will develop and evaluate a novel targeted theory-based intervention, which promotes salient individual factors and access to needed services to address racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in HIV acquisition.                ",Developing a Women-Focused PrEP Intervention for HIV Prevention,9137345,R34MH108437,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Study models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"PC4PrEP: Integrating PrEP into Primary Care ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been proven effective in reducing HIV infection in high-risk men who have sex with men, heterosexually active women and men, and injecting drug users. Despite its 2012 approval by the FDA and the development of CDC clinical guidelines, PrEP uptake has been limited. Significant impediments to PrEP implementation include: system barriers (lack of a medical ""home"" and of models for implementing PrEP); provider barriers (difficulty identifying those likely to benefit from PrEP, inexperience with PrEP, and concerns about adherence and risk compensation); and user barriers (lack of awareness of PrEP, inability to access providers comfortable with prescribing PrEP, and concerns about stigma and side effects). Cost is not a barrier in New York State, where PrEP is covered by many insurance plans, including Medicaid.  Primary Care for PrEP (PC4PrEP) is a structural, multilevel intervention that will integrate PrEP into primary care practices that care for underserved communities in the Bronx, NY, an epicenter of continuing HIV infection in the US. The proposed study is closely aligned with the goals of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in expanding high-quality coordinated primary care in community health centers and integrating HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment services into primary care. PC4PrEP will develop an organizational protocol for prescribing PrEP in primary care; identify high-risk individuals in primary care clinics and community HIV testing sites using a new PrEP Eligibility Tool; link them to primary care providers (PCPs) who can provide PrEP; and counsel potential users about PrEP both before they receive a prescription (to enhance receptivity), and after they initiate PrEP (to enhance adherence). In the course of this study, we will (1) develop and pilot PC4PrEP; (2) implement and evaluate it in ""real-world"" settings (Federally Qualified Health Centers; FQHCs) on objective outcomes as well as provider and patient reports; and (3) present a new model, the PrEP Cascade that - as with the HIV Care Cascade for HIV+ populations - may be used to evaluate the impact of PrEP programs in the US and other countries. PC4PrEP is consistent with CDC and NYSDOH Guidelines and the Affordable Care Act in integrating PrEP into primary care practices and is responsive to recent 2014 NYSDOH recommendations which now position PrEP as a first-line intervention for MSM and transgender women who engage in ongoing condomless anal sex, HIV- partners in sero-discordant relationships, and high-risk heterosexual women in high seroprevalence areas.  There are two Specific Aims: (1) Finalize the PC4PrEP intervention and, in a clinic-randomized Phase 2 futility trial, assess whether it shows promise for increasing PrEP prescription rates in the Bronx, NY; and (2) Identify strengths and limitations of PC4PrEP in two ways: (a) through a mixed-methods process evaluation PrEP-eligible patients and PCPs, counselors and navigators; and (b) by identifying ""fall-off"" at each step of the PrEP Cascade. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Evidence-based prevention approaches such as oral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may move the US epidemic past the ""HIV plateau"", where annual incidence has remained unchanged at 50,000 HIV infections. However, interest in and demand for PrEP are unknown as there are few studies on implementation of PrEP outside of randomized clinical trials.

"Developing an Implementation Program to Optimize Uptake of HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis among Black Women in Primary Care Settings ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Charlene Flash is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator and national leader in eliminating health care disparities in HIV. She strives to master the development and evaluation of theory-driven approaches to bio-behavioral HIV prevention, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), among at-risk Black women. Dr. Flash will accomplish this goal through patient-oriented research, formal mentoring by recognized experts (Drs. Thomas Giordano, Kenneth Mayer, Rivet Amico, Jeffrey Cully and Adaora Adimora) and advanced training in behavioral science, mixed-methodology, and implementation science.  The applicant's K23 research goal is to develop an HIV prevention program for Black women in primary care settings that facilitates access to PrEP. The overall hypothesis is that modifiable patient and provider features influence uptake of biobehavioral prevention. Understanding the influence of these features on CDC HIV PrEP guideline uptake can guide design of an innovative, culturally relevant HIV prevention program. The Program's objective is for Black women engaged in primary care settings to be screened for risk, made aware of PrEP and be able to access PrEP via an informed and equipped provider if the patient is both high risk and interested. Addressing four NIMH high priority areas, this research integrates behavioral and biomedical approaches, incorporates context, and uses implementation science in vulnerable populations.  The first specific aim is to use patient and provider surveys and interviews, grounded in the PARiHS implementation framework, to assess how Black women and their providers approach sexual health, assess HIV risk, and perceive PrEP. The second aim is to develop a PrEP Implementation Program to increase HIV risk assessments among Black women and appropriate PrEP uptake among those at-risk. We will develop and iteratively revise a clinical algorithm to increase HIV risk assessments, PrEP discourse, and PrEP prescribing when appropriate. The algorithm will be informed by data from AIM 1, existing literature, and input from a Multidisciplinary Advisory Board that includes experts in PrEP and implementation science, clinical providers, and at risk Black women patients. The third specific aim is to use a type 3 effectiveness-implementation hybrid design with pre-post evaluation to pilot and evaluate the PrEP Implementation Program in a primary care clinic that serves Black women of low socioeconomic status living in a high HIV incidence zip code.  As additional oral, topical and injectable chemoprophylaxis agents emerge, this work will facilitate their integration into existing health care structures. This research will expand upon the principal investigator's current skills and past work, take advantage of an outstanding research and mentoring environment, and develop an independent researcher whose work decreases HIV incidence among Black women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: CDC recently issued guidelines supporting use of a highly effective biomedical intervention to prevent HIV transmission, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Although Black women in the United States bear disproportionate burden of HIV, limited data exist on how patient and provider features may influence their use of PrEP. This proposal is innovative in its use of implementation science to map out a step-wise approach to increasing PrEP access in a marginalized under-studied population.",Developing an Implementation Program to Optimize Uptake of HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis among Black Women in Primary Care Settings,9150664,K23MH109358,"['Accounting ', ' Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Belief ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Elements ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Records ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' statistics ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Injectable ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' patient oriented study ', ' patient oriented research ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' implementation research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Chemoprophylaxis ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary care setting ', ' study population ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' ']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K23,2016,170808,0.30524552571506636
"Targeted PrEP Implementation: Interrupting HIV Transmission Among Young Black MSM Abstract Young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) have had among the highest recent increases in HIV incidence in the US and Baltimore. The efficacy of control strategies such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is well established, but implementation of these strategies have been limited by available resources and the inability to identify and access those at greatest risk for acquisition. To interrupt HIV transmission it is essential to identify sexual networks with on-going transmission. Once identified, chains of transmission can be interrupted in these networks using a targeted PrEP control strategy to reduce the susceptibility of those at risk. The goal of the proposed research plan is to identify access points for YBMSM within HIV transmission networks and enable the development of a PrEP control strategy to halt transmission within these networks. The applicant is an adolescent medicine and HIV provider with doctoral level training in public health. He is trained as a qualitative researcher and has focused his research on understanding HIV disparities affecting YBMSM. However, as this disparity persists, he has recognized the need to shift his research focus from descriptive studies aimed at understanding the disparity to the effective implementation of strategies aimed at addressing the disparity. Together with his mentors he has developed a training plan to address the additional skills he will for this shift. This training plan includes 1) attaining network analysis skills focused on HIV transmission dynamics in sexual networks, 2) developing field research skills including sampling in venue and internet-based settings, 3) developing mixed methods skills to inform effective implementation design, and 4) attaining knowledge and skills in community-centered implementation of evidence-based prevention strategies. The research plan is designed to identify sex partner meeting venues with ongoing HIV transmission and to explore the barriers and facilitators to accessing and achieving PrEP uptake in YBMSM within these venues Specific Aim 1 is to graph venue affiliation networks linking sex partner meeting venues reported by new MSM HIV cases in Baltimore. Specific Aim 2 is to describe the network structure and compositional characteristics of the venue affiliation networks identified in Aim 1 and, using prospective HIV testing data, to determine the association between network structure, compositional characteristics and HIV incidence and prevalence. Informed by data from the prior aims, Specific Aim 3 is to explore barriers and facilitator to accessing and achieving PrEP uptake in YBMSM in high incidence venue networks in order to interrupt HIV transmission. Through this award, the applicant will become a physician scientist skilled in mixed methods and network analysis, experienced in field research on the ground and online, and skilled in engaging communities in the application of evidence-based prevention. Together with his clinical and public health perspective on the HIV disparities affecting YBMSM, this training will uniquely position him to implement effective strategies to eliminate these disparities and improve the health of patients and their communities. Project Narrative Young Black gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (YBMSM) suffer significant racial disparities in HIV incidence in the U.S. despite advances in treatment and prevention. The purpose of this study is to identify high risk sex partner meeting venues connected by ongoing HIV transmission networks among users. Findings will provide access points for YBMSM at risk for infection. Using these data, the study will explore facilitators and barriers to accessing and achieving PrEP uptake among YBMSM who attend these venues with the goal of using PrEP to halt transmission within these networks.",Targeted PrEP Implementation: Interrupting HIV Transmission Among Young Black MSM,9165428,U01PS005115,[''],NCHHSTP,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,263662,0.17101678849195226
"Intervention to Enhance PrEP Uptake and Adherence in a Community-Based Setting DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) refers to daily or intermittent oral administration of antiretroviral drugs designed to protect high-risk HIV-negative individuals from infection. As PrEP is, at present, the most promising biomedical HIV prevention tool, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released interim guidance for health care providers in January 2011, and is expected to soon release detailed public health guidelines for its use. However, in order for PrEP to become an effective prevention tool, three critical factors must be addressed: a) acceptability, i.e., individuals who would benefit from PrEP must know about it and be willing to take it; b) adherence, i.e., individuals who choose to PrEP as a prevention strategy must take the pills as prescribed; and c) implementation, i.e., processes and protocols must be developed to allow for the integration of PrEP delivery and programs into real world settings in a way that is feasible, scalable, and realistic. The proposed project is a two-phase study, conducted in collaboration with the largest LGBT community health provider in New York City (NYC). This project will focus on three specific aims: 1) Identifying social and behavioral factors that are likely to influence PrEP implementation, acceptance, and use/adherence by MSM in NYC, including factors at individual-, community-, and organizational-levels; 2) Examining social and behavioral factors associated with disparities in access to prevention and care services among MSM in NYC that might directly impact PrEP implementation programs and policies; and 3) Evaluating an intervention in which PrEP is introduced, provided, and supported as part of a prevention package delivered in an community health center. To achieve these aims, the project will enroll high-risk MSM to test a two-stage behavioral intervention. First, eligible participants will be randomized to receive either basic information about PrEP availability or a targeted intervention designed to increase PrEP uptake. Second, participants who accept PrEP (regardless of condition) will be randomized to receive either basic adherence information or an enhanced PrEP adherence intervention. Participants will be followed quarterly for 12 months. Outcome variables will include: PrEP uptake, PrEP persistence, PrEP adherence (measured through self-report and biological measures), STI incidence, and self-reported risk behavior. The project is particularly innovative in that it combines an efficacy and effectiveness trial, testing a new intervention in the setting in which it would most feasibly be delivered, and pioneering a new approach to community-based collaboration and study design that can accelerate the pace of implementation science. The proposed project has the potential to exert a sustained and powerful influence not only on the effectiveness of PrEP interventions for MSM, but also on dissemination and scalability of a targeted intervention within community-based settings and in a manner that reduces disparities in access and maximizes cultural competence and acceptability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a new biomedical approach to HIV prevention with the potential to become a powerful tool. This study identifies social and behavioral factors likely to influence PrEP acceptability and adherence among MSM, and collaborates with a community health center to evaluate a two- stage intervention to improve PrEP uptake, persistence, and adherence.

"Project PrEP-R: Network Support to Engage and Retain Younger Black MSM in PrEP Care Project Summary/Abstract This goal of this project is to refine and pilot test a flexible PrEP Retention (PrEP-R) intervention that leverages organic social support network members of HIV-negative young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) to improve retention in PrEP care. While data exist for YBMSM on PrEP linkage, receipt, and adherence, there is a lack of empirically tested interventions on a key intermediate step: retention in PrEP care. Several existing strategies seek to address challenges to retention in HIV care, including case management, peer health navigation, and multi-modal programs. These efforts all rely on newly created network members, a traditional public health approach. What is often missing in these strategies is a coordinated attempt to harness organic social support networks. Our use of “organic” refers to a naturally existing social support network, which is distinct from newly generated support persons, e.g., assigned peer navigators or case managers. The concept of organic social support as a powerful force in the health of HIV infected persons is well documented, but has been underutilized to retain YBMSM in PrEP care. However, sexual minorities are often stigmatized and need persistent, deep, and ongoing social support, the kind that is often only available from existing confidants— friends, kin, and other persons—with whom one might share personal information and be influenced by. Flexibility of PrEP-R ensures that a support confidant (SC) is selected based on factors such as providing a supportive function (e.g., emotional support) as opposed to their status (e.g., mother). Such SCs are likely important not only to retention in PrEP care, but also to sustained health maintenance, risk reduction behavior maintenance and long-term adherence to PrEP. We have developed a brief, theoretically-grounded, culturally- sensitive PrEP-R intervention that (1) utilizes social support network visualization and network theory to help YBMSM safely identify a SC to engage in retention in PrEP care activities; (2) uses an Information-Motivation- Behavioral Skills Model targeted at the SC to activate and maintain PrEP-specific social support in the dyad; and (3) a linked PrEP-specific social support conceptual model to then drive appointment adherence among index YBMSM. Our primary aims are to: (1) Refine PrEP-R intervention protocol, materials and assessments by (1) shifting more of the intervention to focus on the SC through individual and dyadic sessions; and (2) developing a systematic procedure to generate social support of the client by engaging the SC via mini-booster cell phone sessions; and (2) Pilot test the feasibility (reach, adoption, and implementation) and initial efficacy (number of 3-month periods with 1 completed visit) of the PrEP-R intervention versus standard linkage to care at 12-months post randomization among a sample of 160 YBMSM ages 18-29. Secondary outcomes to be assessed include self-efficacy, social support, HIV/STI testing frequency and maintenance of health insurance. Secondary outcomes include self-efficacy, social support, HIV/STI testing frequency, and health insurance maintenance. This pilot study will provide objective data in support of our next step: an adequately powered RCT testing the effectiveness of PrEP-R to promote retention in PrEP primary care versus treatment as usual. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to refine and test an intervention to retain HIV negative young Black men in PrEP primary care. We do this by recruiting, informing, and motivating naturally existing social support network members to help young men keep their PrEP care appointments, which will have important public health benefits by decreasing the risk of HIV transmission.",Project PrEP-R: Network Support to Engage and Retain Younger Black MSM in PrEP Care,9203952,R34MH111392,"['abstracting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Adoption ', ' Age ', ' Appointment ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' indexing ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Maintenance ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mothers ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Support Groups ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaccination ', ' Friends ', ' Case Management ', ' Family member ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Injectable ', ' Caring ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Lifestyle Risk Reduction ', ' Risk Reduction Behavior ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Care Manager ', ' Case Manager ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief intervention ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Implant ', ' Network-based ', ' secondary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' financial incentive ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' sexual minority ', ' screening ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' peer support ', ' support network ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R34,2016,197251,0.2220709117138864

"Accelerating PrEP Diffusion through Network Change Agents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early evidence exists of disparities in Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) knowledge, PrEP seeking behavior and PrEP adoption based on race. Black communities and in particular, younger Black MSM (YBMSM) have limited PrEP engagement. Evidence of few Black PrEP users is of concern with <15% of PrEP clients in Washington DC and New York City identifying as Black in PrEP demonstration/implementation projects. This finding is in the context of YBMSM leading new infections in these cities (and nationally). Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of PrEP clients nationally are privately insured and older - two characteristics incongruous with current HIV incidence. So while PrEP is promising; real-world PrEP use faces major implementation challenges.  Over the past two decades, the most widely used network-based intervention for HIV prevention has been the opinion leader (OL) model or variants of it. This approach includes training popular members from a target population to promote HIV prevention messages through interpersonal communication. The effectiveness of the OL model can be limited by several factors, including: heterogeneous and overlapping networks, inadequate network assessments, and the OL's public position which often requires she/he maintain conformity to the status quo. Consequently, identifying those who connect across groups of otherwise disconnected individuals (hereafter ""network bridges""), may be an alternative and efficient way to use network information to accelerate behavior change as has been demonstrated in other settings.  This proposal moves beyond traditional OL and peer outreach models by aiming to recruit change agents based upon their structural position in a social network, in this case Facebook, in order to accelerate diffusion of PrEP. This framework is further important for measuring the potential of bridging network members as they may be the earliest innovation adopters and are likely to be more willing to challenge the existing status quo. Such bridges have structural advantages that have led to increased communication, innovation and efficiency in workplace settings; however, such bridging impact in public health contexts is understudied.  We propose to address these knowledge gaps and intervene by building upon two recent studies through three phases. Phase I expands the use of Facebook for accurately characterizing a YBMSM network using a hybrid network data collection approach developed and implemented by the PI. Phase II identifies, recruits and trains change agents based upon their structural position (e.g., bridging, central, or other positions). Phase III measures and evaluates three stages of PrEP diffusion as promoted by the same agents. Our interdisciplinary team has expertise with PrEP implementation (Schneider), bridging metrics (Valente), intervention training (Bouris, Hill), social network analysis (Schneider, Valente, Goodreau), ethics (Karnik) and diffusion (Valente, Khanna). The proposed research will advance current understandings of diffusion of PrEP innovation and if successful, is structured to impact urban HIV epicenters with alarming rates of HIV infection in YBMSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed intervention will utilize bridging network members within a large young Black MSM Facebook network to accelerate the diffusion of PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) knowledge and early adoption in this same network. If successful, this project has the potential to translate a highly efficacious biomedical intervention into an impactful one in a sub-population at highest risk for HIV infection in the United States.",Accelerating PrEP Diffusion through Network Change Agents,9101943,R01AI120700,"['Adoption ', ' Behavior ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Client ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diffusion ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Intervention to Promote PrEP Awareness and Equitable Prescription among Providers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over thirty years into the United States epidemic, social disparities in HIV prevalence persist, with Black Americans, and Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in particular, disproportionately affected. Intensifying HIV prevention efforts in communities of high prevalence as well as maximizing the dissemination and impact of effective interventions are among the top national priorities for addressing HIV.1,2 The proposed training plan in this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) application will provide the essential knowledge and skills that the principal investigator, Sarah K. Calabrese, PhD, needs to launch a productive career in research targeting these public health imperatives. Further, the research conducted throughout the course of this award would contribute meaningfully to the successful delivery of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP, i.e., oral antiretroviral medication for HIV prevention) in real-world clinical practice and could have far-reaching implications for equitable access across social lines. PrEP is a cutting-edge biomedical advancement that received United States Food and Drug Administration approval for prescription in July of 2012, sparking a push for its implementation in health care settings throughout the country. There has been mounting recognition of the need for provider training and education about PrEP3-7 and some discussion of cultural sensitivity being a component thereof,5 but minimal attention paid explicitly to the risk of disparate prescription practices. Documented discrimination in the prescription of antiretroviral medication for treatment purposes as well as preliminary evidence of biases in clinical judgment surrounding PrEP pose a call to action; the proposed research aims to address this call via the development and pilot testing of a single-session, group-based PrEP Awareness + Discrimination Prevention intervention for healthcare providers. The intervention will serve the dual purpose of increasing knowledge about PrEP among providers and averting discriminatory prescription practices using evidence-based strategies derived from social-cognitive psychology. The project will include a comprehensive needs assessment, including eight focus groups with potential PrEP providers from diverse clinical settings (n=48-64), six focus groups with Black MSM at risk for HIV acquisition (i.e., potential PrEP users; n=36-48), key informant interviews with healthcare providers who have experience prescribing PrEP (n=20), and a national quantitative survey of physicians (n=350). The intervention will be pilot tested in a two-armed randomized controlled trial with 80 healthcare providers seeking continuing medical education. The project will yield an intervention manual with detailed curriculum and supporting materials as well as preliminary indicators of intervention feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness, setting the stage for future refinement and evaluation in the context of a larger-scale randomized controlled trial. The training acquired by Dr. Calabrese via this timely and innovative research project, in combination with formal coursework, focused workshops, academic conferences, manuscript preparation, grant-writing, one-on-one mentorship, and other research activities, will target the following three training objectives: (1) to gain mastery in the discipline of social-cognitive psychology on the topics of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination and to obtain training in measurement of implicit bias, (2) to gain expertise in intervention development, implementation, and evaluation, and (3) to enhance statistical analysis skills for application to planned research. Dr. Calabrese will be mentored primarily by John F. Dovidio, PhD, at Yale University, with additional mentoring from Nathan B. Hansen, PhD (Yale University), Kenneth H. Mayer, MD (Harvard Medical School/The Fenway Institute), Joseph R. Betancourt, MD, MPH (Harvard Medical School), and Manya Magnus, PhD, MPH (George Washington University). Dr. Calabrese's training through the proposed K01 award will round out her expertise and fully prepare her for a career as an independent research scientist in the field of HIV prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), a prescription-based daily oral medication for primary prevention of HIV, adds an exciting new option to the growing arsenal of prevention strategies available to individuals at risk for HIV acquisition. As PrEP is introduced into real-world clinical settings, educating potential prescribers about PrEP and ensuring equitable prescription practices are essential given preliminary indicators of racial bias in PrEP-related clinical decision-making. The proposed research aims to develop and pilot test a single-session, group-based intervention for providers to increase their awareness about PrEP and promote equitable prescription practices, ultimately increasing access to PrEP and combating the spread of HIV.",Intervention to Promote PrEP Awareness and Equitable Prescription among Providers,9054170,K01MH103080,"['Acquired Immunologic

"UMass Amherst PREP Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to significantly increase the number of students from underrepresented groups who obtain Ph.D. degrees in biomedical fields. To this end, we will establish a one-year PREP internship that includes independent research and individualized programs of study, each with an interdisciplinary focus designed to increase the competitiveness of the PREP students for admission to rigorous biomedical graduate programs. Our project will capitalize on unique strengths of the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMA): A) UMA leads the Northeast Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NEAGEP), a highly interactive network of 15 minority-serving and research-extensive universities with demonstrated success in recruiting and retaining minority students in STEM Ph.D. programs; B) UMA has well-developed programs of interdisciplinary research and graduate education in biomedicine; C) UMA has developed effective multi-level mentoring programs to support diversity at all levels of academia. We take advantage of these strengths to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Use existing connections in NEAGEP and at UMA to recruit talented students from underrepresented groups; 2) Pre-screen students through a well established eight-week summer program for undergraduate research (SPUR); 3) Provide near- peer and faculty mentors with diversity training; 4) Work with PREP participants and their mentors to formulate individualized programs of study based on interests, strengths and needs of students identified during SPUR; 5) Start mentoring on first contact and continue through graduate school and beyond. During the program, students will engage in a collaborative research project with a primary and secondary faculty mentors, as well as near-peer graduate student mentors. The Institute for Cellular Engineering, Chemistry-Biology Interface and Neuroendocrinology graduate training programs will provide an interdisciplinary focus through specific enrichment courses. Students will participate in regular social and professional development activities, many with NEAGEP doctoral students so that PREP participants will be part of a larger community of minority scholars. Group PREP courses will focus on working in interdisciplinary and diverse groups in biomedicine, developing critical thinking skills and gaining an understanding of the responsible conduct of research. Faculty mentors, PIs and the Office of Graduate Recruitment and Retention will teach students how to apply to graduate school and to obtain pre-doctoral fellowships. At the end of the program, we anticipate that students will enroll in one of the numerous biomedicine graduate programs served by the participating interdisciplinary training programs, graduate programs in other NEAGEP institutions or in other selective graduate programs around the country. This program will help meet the growing need for biomedical researchers who can address issues of health care in all segments of our population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The underrepresentation of U.S. minorities, a growing segment of the population in the biomedical and behavioral research workforce increases reliance on international talent and exacerbates healthcare disparities among racial and socioeconomic groups.

"PC4PrEP: Integrating PrEP into Primary Care ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been proven effective in reducing HIV infection in high-risk men who have sex with men, heterosexually active women and men, and injecting drug users. Despite its 2012 approval by the FDA and the development of CDC clinical guidelines, PrEP uptake has been limited. Significant impediments to PrEP implementation include: system barriers (lack of a medical ""home"" and of models for implementing PrEP); provider barriers (difficulty identifying those likely to benefit from PrEP, inexperience with PrEP, and concerns about adherence and risk compensation); and user barriers (lack of awareness of PrEP, inability to access providers comfortable with prescribing PrEP, and concerns about stigma and side effects). Cost is not a barrier in New York State, where PrEP is covered by many insurance plans, including Medicaid.  Primary Care for PrEP (PC4PrEP) is a structural, multilevel intervention that will integrate PrEP into primary care practices that care for underserved communities in the Bronx, NY, an epicenter of continuing HIV infection in the US. The proposed study is closely aligned with the goals of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in expanding high-quality coordinated primary care in community health centers and integrating HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment services into primary care. PC4PrEP will develop an organizational protocol for prescribing PrEP in primary care; identify high-risk individuals in primary care clinics and community HIV testing sites using a new PrEP Eligibility Tool; link them to primary care providers (PCPs) who can provide PrEP; and counsel potential users about PrEP both before they receive a prescription (to enhance receptivity), and after they initiate PrEP (to enhance adherence). In the course of this study, we will (1) develop and pilot PC4PrEP; (2) implement and evaluate it in ""real-world"" settings (Federally Qualified Health Centers; FQHCs) on objective outcomes as well as provider and patient reports; and (3) present a new model, the PrEP Cascade that - as with the HIV Care Cascade for HIV+ populations - may be used to evaluate the impact of PrEP programs in the US and other countries. PC4PrEP is consistent with CDC and NYSDOH Guidelines and the Affordable Care Act in integrating PrEP into primary care practices and is responsive to recent 2014 NYSDOH recommendations which now position PrEP as a first-line intervention for MSM and transgender women who engage in ongoing condomless anal sex, HIV- partners in sero-discordant relationships, and high-risk heterosexual women in high seroprevalence areas.  There are two Specific Aims: (1) Finalize the PC4PrEP intervention and, in a clinic-randomized Phase 2 futility trial, assess whether it shows promise for increasing PrEP prescription rates in the Bronx, NY; and (2) Identify strengths and limitations of PC4PrEP in two ways: (a) through a mixed-methods process evaluation PrEP-eligible patients and PCPs, counselors and navigators; and (b) by identifying ""fall-off"" at each step of the PrEP Cascade. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Evidence-based prevention approaches such as oral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may move the US epidemic past the ""HIV plateau"", where annual incidence has remained unchanged at 50,000 HIV infections. However, interest in and demand for PrEP are unknown as there are few studies on implementation of PrEP outside of randomized clinical trials.

"Developing a Women-Focused PrEP Intervention for HIV Prevention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV epidemic among women in the United States (US) is a major public health issue and Black and Hispanic women disproportionately affected. Many women at high risk for acquiring HIV infection are not aware of an effective HIV prevention option. An oral antiretroviral medication is now available by prescription for pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Oral PrEP is an efficacious, self-administered, woman-controlled, HIV prevention product. There is a wide gap between recommended use of this effective biomedical HIV prevention method and actual care for women at high risk for acquiring HIV - a gap that needs to be closed in order to avoid worsening already glaring HIV health disparities among women in the US. Alarmingly, there are currently no interventions in the US to promote PrEP uptake among women. The long term goal is to develop effective approaches to support PrEP use and reduce HIV acquisition among high risk women and thereby reduce HIV health disparities. We propose that a theory-based, contextually relevant behavioral intervention combined with linkage to health care and social services, with text message support for adherence, would be feasible and acceptable and could improve PrEP uptake among high risk women. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate an intervention to promote PrEP uptake. Since varying HIV prevention public policy landscapes may also be a factor influencing PrEP uptake, this study will be conducted in two large metropolitan areas with local HIV rates that greatly exceed the national average but with different PrEP public policy and access landscapes. The aims are to : 1.Conduct formative research (40 in-depth interviews and 102 surveys) to identify the association of social-cognitive characteristics, including pre-disposing (e.g., PrEP knowledge, attitudes, norms, self-efficacy and beliefs), enabling (e.g., perceived access to care) and need (perceived HIV risk, risk compensation) with intention of PrEP uptake (initiate, adhere) and assess how these factors are influenced by relevant background factors (e.g., socio-demographics, resources, vulnerability factors). 2. Use findings from Aim 1 to develop an individually-tailored intervention for women to promote PrEP uptake behaviors (initiate, adhere), connect to local PrEP providers, link to community resources that address personal and social barriers to PrEP uptake, and provide a text-message reminder system to support PrEP adherence. 3. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention in a pilot trial (n= 80). The secondary outcomes are to: a) examine PrEP uptake intention & behavior; b) evaluate satisfaction in accessing health care for PrEP, comparing the two sites, and in using a text-message reminder system to support PrEP adherence. Our novel approach combines proven health promotion strategies, linkage to care and technology for substantive impact. This research will advance our understanding of bio-behavioral HIV prevention strategies in heavily affected communities within different PrEP policy and access landscapes. . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed research is relevant to public health because it will improve understanding of the factors that affect uptake of currently underutilized but potentially life-saving services and offers an intervention to close the gap between optimal and typical care. The project is relevant to the NIH Plan for HIV-Related Research because it will develop and evaluate a novel targeted theory-based intervention, which promotes salient individual factors and access to needed services to address racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in HIV acquisition.",Developing a Women-Focused PrEP Intervention for HIV Prevention,9327061,R34MH108437,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Study models ', ' Morbidity -

"Characterizing the HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis care continuum for African American and Hispanic/Latino men who have sex with men PROJECT SUMMARY  Young African American (AA) and Hispanic/Latino (H/L) MSM bear a disproportionate share of the HIV disease burden in the United States (US). Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective in reducing HIV acquisition risks among MSM, but its ability to reduce HIV acquisition among AA and H/L MSM hinges on optimal implementation and expanded use in “real-world” clinical settings. Preliminary studies demonstrate that AA and H/L initiate PrEP and are retained in PrEP care at lower rates than their White counterparts, but little is known about longer-term adherence and retention in PrEP care among AA and H/L MSM. The manner in which structural, social, and individual level factors impact PrEP outcomes in real-world settings, particularly among young AA and H/L MSM, are not yet well understood. MSM who initiate PrEP may change behaviors (e.g., enter a monogamous relationship with an HIV negative partner) and no longer be indicated for PrEP. Furthermore, it is largely unknown why individuals, especially AA and H/L MSM, are not retained in PrEP care which complicates development of appropriate interventions to enhance retention in PrEP care. This proposed study follows a longitudinal, observational cohort (n=450) of White, AA and H/L MSM in real-world PrEP programs in Mississippi, Missouri, and Rhode Island to both characterize a PrEP care continuum and predict why MSM are sub-optimally adherent or lost to care, with a focus on measuring racial and ethnic disparities (Specific Aim 1). We will conduct individual interviews with MSM who are prescribed PrEP but sub-optimally adherent or drop out of PrEP care (Specific Aim 2) to elucidate reasons for sub-optimal adherence and retention and to identify components of potential interventions to improve adherence and retention in care. Using data from our longitudinal cohort, we will perform microsimulations in the context of an agent-based model to evaluate the impact of sub-optimal PrEP adherence and retention in care on HIV incidence in three diverse US settings. We will then predict the impact of potential interventions on PrEP care continuum outcomes (Specific Aim 3). PROJECT NARRATIVE  Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in preventing HIV transmission among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM). However, preliminary studies show that young African American and Hispanic/Latino MSM are retained in PrEP care at lower rates than their White counterparts. This study will follow a large, real-world cohort of MSM enrolled across three diverse United States settings to characterize rates of adherence and retention in PrEP care for young White, African American and Hispanic/Latino MSM, reasons for suboptimal adherence and retention in care, and the impact of different interventions to enhance adherence and retention in PrEP care outcomes on HIV incidence.",Characterizing the HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis care continuum for African American and Hispanic/Latino men who have sex with men,9410241,R01MH114657,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geography ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Mississippi ', ' Missouri ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' Seasons ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Gays ', ' uptake ', ' Spottings ', ' programs ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Drops ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' prospective ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' FDA approved ', ' primary outcome ', ' clinical infrastructure ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' retention rate ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' ']",NIMH,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R01,2017,780394,0.2793831013845346
"The Effect of Intersecting Stigmas on PrEP Outcomes for Young Black MSM Abstract Despite recent progress, Black Americans continue to bear the most severe burden of HIV/AIDS in the nation, and young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) continue to be most affected. Antiretroviral pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been endorsed as a potentially effective part of HIV combination prevention strategies and an opportunity to reduce new infections among YBMSM. However, without significant efforts to develop age and culturally-tailored PrEP interventions for YBMSM, PrEP use may only be accessible and utilized by older, White, more affluent MSM, further exacerbating HIV disparities. Through the framework of intersectionality, the proposed research examines how various, intersectional stigmas may limit YBMSM’s ability and willingness to use PrEP. Various stigmas experienced by Black MSM (homonegativity, racism) are associated with adverse outcomes along the HIV care continuum and there is reason to believe these stigmas may also negatively affect PrEP outcomes. The proposed study aims to address the current lack of research on YBMSM’s barriers to using PrEP and gather the data necessary to inform a tailored intervention for YBMSM. The study will take place in Milwaukee, WI. In phase I, we will conduct 9 focus groups (n=72-90) with YBMSM ages 16-25 to explore YBMSM’s knowledge and perceptions of PrEP, identify individual, community and structural level factors likely to affect PrEP uptake among YBMSM, and examine YBMSM’s general healthcare utilization patterns and barriers. Additionally, we will employ a quantitative study to examine the relationship between various stigmas (racism, medical mistrust, homonegativity) and examine the effects of intersecting stigmas on knowledge and acceptance of PrEP among 300 YBMSM. We hypothesize that racism, homonegativity, and the intersection of those stigmas will predict lower knowledge of PrEP, reduced likelihood of using PrEP, and greater PrEP stigma. We also hypothesize that the relationships between various stigmas and PrEP outcomes will be moderated by resiliency and social support. In Phase II, we will use findings from Phase I and community-based participatory research methods to develop an evidence-based multi-level intervention tailored to YBMSM to be tested in a future R34. Findings from this study may not only be useful in increasing PrEP use among YBMSM, but may also be generalized to other outcomes along the care continuum. The training plan in this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) application will provide the training and research experience necessary to support Dr. Katherine Quinn’s transition to an independent HIV prevention and intervention researcher. Training includes four primary goals: build content expertise in intersectional stigma, develop mastery of complex statistical modeling for intersectionality and mixed-methods research, build expertise in intervention science, and enhance career and professional development. The training acquired by Dr. Quinn includes didactic coursework, academic conferences, manuscript preparation, independent study, grant writing workshops and other research activities. Project Narrative Young, black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may be an essential part of combination prevention strategies to curb these disparities. Stigma may be a limiting factor in the success of PrEP for YBMSM and this research will examine how intersectional stigma experienced by YBMSM may influence PrEP knowledge and uptake. The promise of PrEP can only be fully realized if we understand the factors that shape YBMSM’s engagement with PrEP and findings from this study will inform a tailored PrEP intervention for YBMSM.

"Following a U.S. National Cohort of Vulnerable Men to Improve HIV Prevention and Care Project Summary  RFA-AI-16-031 (LITE) is designed to address critical needs in HIV prevention research by using innovative technology to enroll and follow large-scale epidemiological cohorts of those at highest risk of infection. The proposed project will utilize established Internet-based strategies, previously used successfully by the research team, to enroll a sample of 5,000 high-risk HIV-negative gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM) ages 16 to 49—the population representing the highest percentage of new infections annually—and follow them prospectively for four years. The design features of our proposal were chosen specifically to: (a) identify individual-, network-, and contextual-level predictors and correlates of HIV seroconversion, (b) identify missed HIV prevention opportunities among those seroconverting during the course of the study, and, thus (c) inform interventions to further reduce acquisition and transmission.  We define “high-risk” as meeting CDC guidelines for PrEP treatment, but not taking PrEP. Participants will complete annual self-administered at-home rapid HIV testing (results submitted via digital photo of the test paddle) as well as brief (~20 min) at-home computerized surveys. In addition to being referred for treatment, study participants who seroconvert will complete a semi-structured telephone interview to identify missed HIV prevention opportunities and the contextual factors involved. We will monitor newly diagnosed participants' movement through the HIV care continuum. Based on current incidence rates, we anticipate accumulating ~252 infections during the study; however, because we are targeting high-risk men, this number could be higher. Aim 1 (UG3 Phase): Establish a cohort of 5,000 high-risk HIV-negative GBM who are not on PrEP, all of  whom complete baseline online surveys and at-home self-administered HIV testing, as well as consent for  longitudinal follow-up. Determine PrEP uptake and HIV incidence 12 months after study enrollment.  Supplemental Aims: Using the cross sectional data from GBM deemed ineligible during screening for study eligibility: Sup. Aim 1a—Estimate the uptake of PrEP; and Sup. Aim 1b—Characterize missed HIV  prevention opportunities (e.g., reasons for no prior PrEP use) among recent HIV seroconverters. Aim 2 (UH3 Phase): Follow the cohort for four years to characterize (2a) individual/network/contextual-level  determinants of PrEP uptake/discontinuation; (2b) new HIV seroconversions and missed HIV prevention  opportunities, including individual/network/contextual-level determinants; (2c) racial/ethnic disparities in  HIV incidence and their trends over time; and (2d) the influence of PrEP uptake on racial/ethnic disparities. Project Summary  This study will characterize HIV incidence and PrEP in a U.S. national sample of 5000 vulnerable men at risk for HIV. We will use technology-mediated methods to follow the sample for four years. Because participation in research studies that include frequent in-person contact with research personnel can impact participant behavior in ways that make them less representative of the high-risk populations from which they were drawn, we will utilize technological approaches to facilitate participation that are minimally invasive, and that incentivizes participation with nominal behavioral interference.",Following a U.S. National Cohort of Vulnerable Men to Improve HIV Prevention and Care,9393530,UG3AI133675,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Color ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Geography ', ' Hawthorne Effect ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incentives ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Gays ', ' uptake ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Test Result ', ' psychosocial ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' meetings ', ' innovative technologies ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' minimally invasive ', ' screening ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' seroconversion ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' Time trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', ' urban setting ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' ']",NIAID,GRADUATE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH POLICY,UG3,2017,1203451,0.25580151886755015
"Yale Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) at Yale University that will provide eight URM baccalaureate graduates with a one-year program of faculty-mentored research training in the biomedical sciences and educational preparation for graduate school admission. The long-term goal of the proposed Yale PREP is to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) students pursuing doctoral studies in the biomedical sciences, especially at Yale. Yale PREP will recruit baccalaureate graduates from a wide range of colleges and universities but especially historically black colleges and universities, Hispanic serving institutions, and the University of Puerto Rico, as well as through an exciting new partnership between Yale and Chaminade University of Honolulu, a Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander serving institution. The goal of Yale PREP is to provide program participants with a foundation of knowledge, experiences, and skills necessary to be successful graduate students. Specific objectives for program participants are: 1) To experience life as a biomedical graduate student at a major research university, taking courses and receiving mentoring alongside first year PhD students. 2) To conduct, under supervision of a faculty mentor, an independent research project for which they ultimately take responsibility for planning and executing experiments, including formulating and testing hypotheses. 3) To study an educational curriculum that consists of GRE preparation, graduate school and career workshops, a research literature seminar course, a journal club covering health-disparities research, Yale courses, and research presentations. Program participants will devote 75% of their time to independent research and 25% to the educational curriculum. Expected outcomes for Yale PREP participants include improved laboratory skills, problem-solving abilities, biomedical research knowledge, and presentation skills. They will also demonstrate an increased commitment to biomedical research, which should ultimately culminate in the pursuit of the PhD degree. The impact of the proposed Yale PREP will be to expand the pool of exceptional doctoral students from underrepresented groups in the biomedical sciences and thus the diversity of perspectives needed to address important problems in human health and disease, including health disparities.

"Developing a PrEP Screening Instrument for Identification/Referral of High-Risk MSM in Primary Care Project Abstract A significant public health development, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is now being widely promoted as a prevention strategy for individuals in high-risk groups, such as men who have sex with men who report substance-use (past 6-month illegal drug use and/or heavy alcohol use). While this is an exciting development, rapid identification of these high-risk patients and the ability to provide brief consultation and prescription or referral for PrEP services by primary care staff remains a major concern. The proposed mixed methods study aims to develop and pilot-test a PrEP screening instrument for facilitating PrEP uptake among substance-using MSM that will be integrated into clinic workflow based on provider-identified barriers and facilitators to sexual-health screening. The study will take place in a single primary care clinic contained within a larger integrated healthcare delivery system, Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC). Identification of both the provider- and patient-level barriers to PrEP uptake among high-risk substance-using MSM within a large integrated healthcare system will inform future intervention efforts aimed at mitigating HIV health disparities. The proposed 2-year pilot study will involve the collection of preliminary data to inform the development of a larger formal evaluation study. This project is significant in that it seeks to develop and test a screening instrument that will be administered to patients during appointment check-in and made available to their primary care provider for the rapid identification of substance-using MSM at high-risk for HIV acquisition in order to facilitate PrEP prescription/referral. This project is innovative in its focus on the identification of potential provider-, patient-, and system-level barriers to PrEP uptake among these patients.

"Developing a PrEP Adherence Intervention Targeting At-Risk and Substance Using Women Project Summary We aim to develop and assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy on adherence of a community-informed tenofovir/emticitrabine (TDF/FTC) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) engagement intervention among street-based female sex workers (FSWs) in Baltimore, Maryland. PrEP is a potentially empowering method of HIV protection that is safe and effective, however, there is little research to inform PrEP targeting and use among FSWs. The CDC Clinical Guidelines indicate PrEP for women engaged in sex work. Through a community participatory process, we propose developing a small group, mHealth-enhanced peer- navigator intervention, STAR-PrEP (Sex workers Take Action and Responsibility), aimed raise PrEP awareness among FSWs and to to enhance PrEP uptake and adherence. The study is informed by psychological empowerment and fundamental cause theories. The study aims to: 1). employ community engaged research activities (e.g., community forums, focus groups, component testing, in-depth interviews) to identify FSW-specific barriers to PrEP engagement and to develop a small group and mHealth enhanced SW- PrEP intervention to promote PrEP uptake and adherence among street-based HIV-negative FSWs (N=40) in Baltimore Maryland; 2) assess the STAR-PrEP’s acceptability (e.g., refusal rates, intervention engagement) and feasibility (e.g., recruitment, retention) among intervention participants (n=40), and preliminary efficacy on PrEP uptake and adherence in intervention versus comparison participants (n=40) among street-based FSWs in Baltimore, Maryland at 6-month follow-up; 2a) to explore the role of empowerment (e.g. perceived stigma, social support) and structural vulnerability (e.g., access to care) factors as correlates or possible mediators of the intervention effect on study outcomes in intervention (n=40) versus comparison participants (n=40) at 6-month follow-up; and 3) to explore predictors (i.e., homelessness, depression, drug use) of STAR- PrEP participants on monthly drug adherence among street-based FSWs (N=40) in Baltimore, Maryland at the 6-month follow up. Drug adherence will be detected by 6-monthly plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells tests. The proposal is directly responsive to RFA-MH-17-361 and addresses 3 NIH HIV/AIDS Research Priorities: 1) reducing “incidence in HIV/AIDS” among a high risk yet understudied population; 2) reducing health disparities among socially and economically marginalized group of women who are largely African American; and 3) training peer navigators to increase a “workforce to conduct high priority HIV/AIDS research."" The proposed intervention is one of the first to focus on this high-risk yet understudied population in the U.S., and is strengthened by its partnership with longstanding community healthcare providers to prescribe PrEP. Data will inform the design, recruitment, and effect size of a future R01 focused on a larger trial targeting street-based FSWs and PrEP providers. Project Relevance The proposed study will inform the development of a multifaceted PrEP adherence intervention targeting street-based female sex workers (FSWs) in Baltimore, Maryland. The study will include an extensive community engaged research activities co-led by a FSW Community Advisory Board, including FSW community forums focus groups, component testing, and in-depth interviews with community-based PrEP providers. This process will result in the development of a small group, mHealth-enhanced peer-navigator intervention, STAR-PrEP (Sex workers Take Action and Responsibility). The intervention aims to enhance PrEP awareness among FSWs as well as increase PrEP uptake and adherence among the intervention (n=40) compared to the comparison (n=40) participants, while adherence will be detected among intervention participants t detected by 6-monthly plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) tests.",Developing a PrEP Adherence Intervention Targeting At-Risk and Substance Using Women,9405193,R34DA045619,"['Awareness ', ' Baltimore ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Community Workers ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Maryland ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Homelessness ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' uptake ', ' Review Literature ', ' Nature ', ' Research Priority ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Pattern ', ' Outcome Study ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' PBMC ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' empowerment ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' arm ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' navigator intervention ', ' female sex worker ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' ']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R34,2017,245250,0.3409618744492109
"Increasing PrEP Use in High-Risk Social Networks of African American MSM in Underserved Low-Uptake Cities Abstract  PrEP is a powerful and potentially groundbreaking HIV prevention strategy, but its public health impact will depend on widescale adoption by persons at greatest risk for contracting HIV infection. PrEP awareness and use remain especially low among African American MSM in mid-sized cities across the center of the country, and very little research has tested interventions that can increase PrEP awareness, benefit perception, and normative support—and decrease PrEP stigma and concerns—among African American MSM in these cities. PrEP can achieve its full public health potential only when its uptake among racial minority MSM in neglected mid-sized American cities is increased. In prior research, our team established that network-level interventions can reach and be used to deliver effective HIV risk reduction interventions to Black MSM in the industrial Midwest, including hard-to-reach men hidden in the community. The planned mixed- methods research will now evaluate a network intervention to increase PrEP uptake among high-risk African American MSM in Milwaukee and Cleveland, cities where HIV racial disparities are profound but PrEP use is low. In a formative research phase, in-depth interviews will be conducted with African American MSM, PrEP providers, and other key informants in each city to identify understandings, concerns, barriers, and facilitators of PrEP use. In the main intervention trial phase, 36 social networks of high-risk racial minority MSM (expected n=504 participants) will be enrolled, 18 networks per city, by recruiting high-risk initial “seeds,” members of each seed's MSM friendship network, and then two outward successive rings of their friends. All study participants will receive baseline counseling for PrEP and risk reduction. The 36 networks will then be randomized in equal numbers to intervention and comparison conditions. In each intervention condition network, a cadre of network leaders open to PrEP, trusted for advice, and highly interconnected with others will attend an intervention that educates and then provides training and guidance in diffusing messages to friends to encourage PrEP uptake, correcting PrEP misconceptions and stigma, and instilling positive PrEP norms and benefit perceptions. At baseline and 6- and 15-month followup points, participants will complete measures of PrEP use corroborated by the testing of dried blood spot specimens for tenofovir; measures of PrEP related knowledge, attitudes, perceived norms, and stage of change readiness; sexual risk practices; and substance use. We hypothesize that the network intervention will produce greater PrEP adoption by HIV- participants than that found in comparison networks. PrEP knowledge, attitudes, intentions, peer norms, and stage of change readiness will be explored as both mediators and as secondary outcomes. Intervention effects on HIV incidence will be mathematically modeled to determine its public health impact. This research will test a novel approach for increasing PrEP use among neglected racial minority MSM in mid-sized American cities who can best—and can perhaps only—be reached through their social network connections. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) regimens greatly reduce the likelihood that high-risk uninfected men who have sex with men (MSM) will contract HIV infection. However, PrEP use remains very low in mid-sized cities across the country, especially among African American MSM who may be hidden in the community and hard to reach through conventional PrEP awareness campaigns. This research will employ a social network approach for both reaching racial minority MSM in the community and delivering an intervention in which peer network leaders are taught and enlisted to increase awareness, correct misconceptions, reduce stigma, and increase benefit perception and positive attitudes of their network members toward PrEP. Results of the study will improve models for HIV prevention implementation science among African American MSM in neglected regions of the country.  ",Increasing PrEP Use in High-Risk Social Networks of African American MSM in Underserved Low-Uptake Cities,9408208,R01NR017574,"['Adoption ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Goals ', ' positive attitude ', ' Happiness ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Industrialization ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Persons ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Seeds ', ' seed ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Syphilis ', ' great pox ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' Friendships ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Diffuse ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' uptake ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Community Networks ', ' Spottings ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' behavior change ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' HIV risk ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' neglect ', ' community intervention ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Regimen ', ' Prevention trial ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' peer networks ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' support network ', ' racial minority ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' ']",NINR,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R01,2017,692184,0.3182091571784418
"Accelerating PrEP Diffusion through Network Change Agents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early evidence exists of disparities in Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) knowledge, PrEP seeking behavior and PrEP adoption based on race. Black communities and in particular, younger Black MSM (YBMSM) have limited PrEP engagement. Evidence of few Black PrEP users is of concern with <15% of PrEP clients in Washington DC and New York City identifying as Black in PrEP demonstration/implementation projects. This finding is in the context of YBMSM leading new infections in these cities (and nationally). Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of PrEP clients nationally are privately insured and older - two characteristics incongruous with current HIV incidence. So while PrEP is promising; real-world PrEP use faces major implementation challenges.  Over the past two decades, the most widely used network-based intervention for HIV prevention has been the opinion leader (OL) model or variants of it. This approach includes training popular members from a target population to promote HIV prevention messages through interpersonal communication. The effectiveness of the OL model can be limited by several factors, including: heterogeneous and overlapping networks, inadequate network assessments, and the OL's public position which often requires she/he maintain conformity to the status quo. Consequently, identifying those who connect across groups of otherwise disconnected individuals (hereafter ""network bridges""), may be an alternative and efficient way to use network information to accelerate behavior change as has been demonstrated in other settings.  This proposal moves beyond traditional OL and peer outreach models by aiming to recruit change agents based upon their structural position in a social network, in this case Facebook, in order to accelerate diffusion of PrEP. This framework is further important for measuring the potential of bridging network members as they may be the earliest innovation adopters and are likely to be more willing to challenge the existing status quo. Such bridges have structural advantages that have led to increased communication, innovation and efficiency in workplace settings; however, such bridging impact in public health contexts is understudied.  We propose to address these knowledge gaps and intervene by building upon two recent studies through three phases. Phase I expands the use of Facebook for accurately characterizing a YBMSM network using a hybrid network data collection approach developed and implemented by the PI. Phase II identifies, recruits and trains change agents based upon their structural position (e.g., bridging, central, or other positions). Phase III measures and evaluates three stages of PrEP diffusion as promoted by the same agents. Our interdisciplinary team has expertise with PrEP implementation (Schneider), bridging metrics (Valente), intervention training (Bouris, Hill), social network analysis (Schneider, Valente, Goodreau), ethics (Karnik) and diffusion (Valente, Khanna). The proposed research will advance current understandings of diffusion of PrEP innovation and if successful, is structured to impact urban HIV epicenters with alarming rates of HIV infection in YBMSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed intervention will utilize bridging network members within a large young Black MSM Facebook network to accelerate the diffusion of PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) knowledge and early adoption in this same network. If successful, this project has the potential to translate a highly efficacious biomedical intervention into an impactful one in a sub-population at highest risk for HIV infection in the United States.",Accelerating PrEP Diffusion through Network Change Agents,9206439,R01AI120700,"['Adoption ', ' Behavior ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Client ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diffusion ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of Mount Sinai's Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (Mount Sinai PREP) is to make a significant contribution to increasing the number of biomedical scientists from underrepresented minority groups, socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds or those who are challenged by a disability. We aim to prepare recent college graduates from these groups to enroll and succeed in competitive PhD and MD/PhD programs, and then complete postdoctoral or residency/fellowship training before entering careers in which they can contribute to biomedical research, drug development, or research on health and health care disparities. Now in its 12th year, Mount Sinai PREP alumni have garnered 12 PhD degrees, with 2 of those students ready to complete their MD/PhD training this May, while completion of 4 more PhD degrees is also expected by the summer. During their pre-doctoral work, 20 Mount Sinai PREP alumni were supported by traineeships on T32 training grants, 9 were awarded F31 fellowships and many other prestigious fellowships were obtained, e.g. 3 UNCF-Merck awards. All the PREP alumni who completed PhD programs to-date have entered postdoctoral work: 7 in academic settings, with prestigious fellowships including the CDC Infectious Disease Fellowship and HHMI Life Sciences Award~ 1 at NIAID, with an IRTA award ~ 1 at the FDA with an FDA Commissioner's award, who is now a Pharmaceuticals Reviewer on the FDA staff ~ and 1 who pursued postdoctoral work at Glaxo-Smith-Kline. Enhanced recruitment efforts, program evaluation (self-evaluation and external evaluation) and ongoing program development have enabled the program to achieve and benefit from a large applicant pool and maintain an accept/enter ratio between 1 and 1.2. Central strategies of Mount Sinai PREP include the following. We strive to ensure that each PREP scholar has a laboratory placement with an excellent faculty research mentor, supportive peer mentors, and an opportunity to work on a cutting-edge project of interest that develops analytical, conceptual and technical skills. We expect PREP scholars to integrate into laboratory activities such as lab meetings, journal clubs, and parties. They are also expected to integrate into the PREP community and activities such as workshops that build research, presentation, writing skills, or initiate a discussion of psychosocial well-being. PREP activities also include peer-led WIPs/J. Clubs, lunches with advisors and guests with interesting paths to share, and encounters with PREP alumni. We further promote their integration into activities of the PhD, MD/PhD and master's student community of the Graduate School, which whom PREP scholars interact in courses, seminars, and both outreach and social activities. The Program joins a Regional PREP Symposium, at which the PREP scholars present their work and network. The Program will also follow up on a well-received 10 year Reunion-Retreat with a Reunion-Retreat every 5 years. The Program maintains close touch with PREP alumni through emails, reunions, alumni visits to speak to current PREP scholars and Program Director visits to them during travel to a nearby meeting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mount Sinai PREP seeks to increase the participation of individuals from underrepresented minority groups and socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals at the cutting-edge levels of biomedical research, and seeks to accommodate individuals with disabilities. Research shows that diverse groups function more effectively and innovatively than groups lacking diversity. Major benefits to public health will result from furthe diversification of the biomedical work-force and a diverse work-force will increased engagement and expert focus on problems related to health and health care disparities, which are in need of such focus.",Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP),9321822,R25GM064118,"['Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' electronic communication ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Fellowship ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interviewer ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentors ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Periodicity ', ' Rhythmicity ', ' Cyclicity ', ' Program Development ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Residencies ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Schools ', ' Self Assessment ', ' statistics ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Talents ', ' Traineeship ', ' Travel ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Self-reflection ', ' Self-Surveillance ', ' Self evaluation ', ' Self-Examination ', ' technical skills ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Activity ', ' Development Plans ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' instrument ', ' Retreatment ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Reaction ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohesion ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' peer ', ' empowerment ', ' outreach ', ' Touch sensation ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' drug development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Institution ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Address ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Measurable ', ' NCI Scholars Program ', ' Scholars Program ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' NIAID ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' public health relevance ', ' anxious ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' faculty mentor ', ' faculty research ', ' peer coaching ', ' peer teaching ', ' peer mentoring ', ' peer led team learning ', ' peer instruction ', ' support network ', ' laboratory experiment ', ' laboratory exercise ', ' laboratory assignment ', ' laboratory activity ', ' lab experiment ', ' lab assignment ', ' education research ', ' Diverse Workforce ', ' Workplace Diversity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' ']",NIGMS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R25,2017,404696,0.38870451486211055
"UMB Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of Ph.D. students from diverse backgrounds is acutely underrepresented in biomedical and behavioral sciences in the United States despite the growing proportions of minorities in the population. Through participation in several underrepresented minority (UR)-focused mentoring programs, the Science Training for Advancing Biomedical Research (STAR)-PREP director brings unique insights (from a mentee's perspective) and a great understanding of the attributes required for being a successful mentor. This STAR- PREP is designed to provide aspiring UR biomedical scientists with a specialized but comprehensive training plan. Highly functional and dynamic individual development plans (IDP) will be employed to address the Scholars' weaknesses and strengthen their skills to increase their competitiveness leading to acceptance into top-notch Ph.D. or M.D.-Ph.D. programs. We will take advantage of ongoing interactions with local UR- centered undergraduate programs and with various established programs including T32 grants on campus by incorporating into IDPs regular participation in T32-funded training activities. Our hypothesis is that active participation in an integrated multidimensional research, clinical and mentored research training program coupled with innovations in academic development will result in greater than 75% of PREP Scholars pursuing biomedical research careers. Aim 1 is to ensure an outstanding biomedical research experience to build and refine the STAR-PREP Scholar's research skills. This will be accomplished through use of a diverse community of outstanding faculty and students, state-of-the-art technologies and innovations in interdisciplinary education and training in an atmosphere that explicitly emphasizes excellence and biomedical research. Aim 2 is to strengthen and expand the STAR-PREP Scholar's academic portfolio to facilitate acceptance into a top-notch graduate program. This aim will also support and guide the PREP Scholar thru every step of the graduate school application process, prepare the Scholar for the GRE test and provide direct experience in select Ph.D. courses. Through Aim 3, we will provide a set of high- quality professional development activities individualized for each STAR-PREP Scholar. PREP Scholars will participate in a variety of research poster presentation forums, scientific writing workshops, diversity seminars and attend/present at a national science conference. Aim 4 will provide a continuous dynamic mentoring and community-building research-centered experience. Through this aim we propose to establish a sense of community through social and academic activities between Scholars, mentors and Ph.D. students. The success of each of our aims will be regularly assessed through individual diagnostic assessment tools administered by internal and external evaluators to ensure a positive and meaningful experience to successfully transition Scholars to graduate programs.

"Mapping perceptions of PrEP use in transwomen and barriers to care in providers to inform intervention development Project Summary Transgender women are at significantly higher risk of contracting HIV, yet analysis of the iPrEx study indicates use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) had no effectiveness in preventing HIV in this group on an intention-to- treat basis. While significantly understudied, qualitative work suggests that trans women experience unique, trans-specific issues, including prioritization of hormone therapy and transition-related medical care over HIV prevention, and real and perceived trans-related stigma and discrimination in healthcare settings. The result is a significant group who is highly vulnerable to HIV infection and its negative health consequences, yet is less likely to benefit from PrEP. Research is urgently needed to understand how trans women perceive their HIV risk and make decisions about PrEP, as well as how healthcare providers address stigma and structural barriers to treatment, so that appropriate interventions can be developed. Utilizing perceptual mapping and vector modeling techniques, we will conduct a mixed methods study in San Francisco and Philadelphia combining in-depth qualitative methods with quantitative surveys to assess trans women's perceptions of PrEP, and get feedback on stigma and structural barriers to accessing healthcare from providers. Using vector message modeling, these maps will be used to identify specific message strategies to be embedded into larger interventions to address trans women's PrEP barriers and providers' barriers to treating trans women. Specific aims of the research are: 1: To create perceptual mapping survey instruments for trans women and healthcare providers to assess perceptions of PrEP, trans-related stigma, and barriers to healthcare. To accomplish this we will conduct focus groups (n=60) and interviews with healthcare providers (n=10) serving trans women and then develop perceptual mapping surveys based on findings; 2. To develop highly targeted messages to enhance PrEP decision-making in trans women and address structural barriers and beliefs in providers using perceptual mapping and vector modeling. To accomplish this aim we will conduct perceptual mapping surveys with trans women (n=100) and healthcare providers (n=50) and perform perceptual mapping and vector message modeling analysis to develop messages; 3. To assess the messages for cultural salience and get insight into acceptable communication channels and intervention activities to enhance decision making around PrEP use in HIV-negative trans women and address stigmatizing beliefs and structural barriers in providers. We will accomplish this by conducting focus groups with trans women (n=40) and interviews with providers (n=10) to get feedback on how messages would be best delivered in an intervention and analyze data to identify the most effective messages and delivery strategies. We expect our innovative methods will have wide application for designing effective, tailored messages to address barriers to PrEP and concerns about structural barriers to receiving healthcare, an important strategy for eliminating health disparities among an at- risk trans women. Project Narrative The proposed study will significantly contribute to the field of HIV prevention by providing insight into the specific perceptions of trans women and healthcare providers, which have application for development of interventions that address trans-specific barriers to PrEP uptake and adherence. Using perceptual mapping, an innovative marketing evaluation technique, we will identify trans women's perceptions and incorporate strategies for navigating structural barriers and stigma by getting insights from their healthcare providers.

"Optimizing PrEP Utilization among Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Using Women of Color Project Summary As we edge closer to the half century mark of the HIV epidemic, the disproportionate effect on women of color in the U.S. continues to be jolting. Women overall have been at a disadvantage in the epidemic due to gender differences and norms that shape biological, social and economic vulnerability. Racial and ethnic disparities magnify the risk. Co-factors such as alcohol and other drug (AOD) use intersect and reinforce other comorbidities. Living in a high prevalence area significantly hardens the risk and makes it tougher to overcome. Options to help women stay HIV negative have been limited. However, this obstacle shifted several years ago with FDA approval and CDC endorsement of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Yet, the majority of U.S. women do not know that PrEP can be a female-controlled strategy or that it applies to them—and backup has not been forthcoming from providers or their communities. What is most disturbing, however, is the absence of PrEP as an accessible strategy among women of color in high impact regions of the country. This developmental U34 responds to RFA-AA-17-013, which prioritizes community based participatory research (CBPR) to develop implementation models for women that address alcohol and HIV in high impact regions and communities. The proposed study will produce an evidence- and CBPR-driven PrEP implementation intervention to enhance uptake and optimize use among women of color in South Florida, which is currently the highest impact region of the U.S. with HIV rates recently determined by the CDC to be the highest in the nation. The study builds upon the team’s experience in alcohol/HIV intervention and CBPR in South Florida and preliminary work with stakeholders from the greater Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas to develop a multi- level PrEP intervention program for African American, Latina, and Haitian women who engage in risky sex and AOD use. The study includes researchers from the Southern HIV and Alcohol Research Consortium (SHARC) and will inform the design of target and comparison groups and other features of a U01 for further study within the NIAAA CHAART Consortia. Guided by the social ecological framework, the study will: identify needs, priorities, and community strengths and develop a PrEP continuum during a summit to engage stakeholders (Aim 1); produce a replicable implementation program, including manuals, materials, instruments, and procedures, through the formation of a Community Advisory and Advocacy Board (Aim 2); and conduct an exploratory pilot among 120 multi-ethnic women of color in Broward and Miami-Dade counties to test fidelity, feasibility and acceptability and measure PrEP uptake and adherence and retention in care over a 6 month period. The study will utilize biomarkers in a subsample to compare with self-reports and pharmacy refill measures. It will be among the first to develop a PrEP intervention in the South for women of color, and is thus in line with the specific high funding priorities of the Office of AIDS Research on cross-cutting research to reduce health disparities in developing implementation approaches for bio-behavioral strategies such as PrEP. Public Health Relevance Despite FDA approval in 2012, followed by recommendations from the CDC and WHO, the majority of women in the U.S. are not aware of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as an HIV prevention strategy that applies to them. The purpose of this study is to use a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) model to develop and preliminarily test an intervention program that will optimize oral PrEP utilization among women of color in South Florida, the region with the highest HIV rates in the U.S. The intervention will evaluate fidelity, feasibility and acceptability, determine patterns of PrEP uptake and adherence and retention in care, and explore the known correlates of risk such as AOD use.",Optimizing PrEP Utilization among Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Using Women of Color,9408198,U34AA026219,"['Acquired

"Targeted PrEP Implementation: Interrupting HIV Transmission Among Young Black MSM Abstract Young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) have had among the highest recent increases in HIV incidence in the US and Baltimore. The efficacy of control strategies such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is well established, but implementation of these strategies have been limited by available resources and the inability to identify and access those at greatest risk for acquisition. To interrupt HIV transmission it is essential to identify sexual networks with on-going transmission. Once identified, chains of transmission can be interrupted in these networks using a targeted PrEP control strategy to reduce the susceptibility of those at risk. The goal of the proposed research plan is to identify access points for YBMSM within HIV transmission networks and enable the development of a PrEP control strategy to halt transmission within these networks. The applicant is an adolescent medicine and HIV provider with doctoral level training in public health. He is trained as a qualitative researcher and has focused his research on understanding HIV disparities affecting YBMSM. However, as this disparity persists, he has recognized the need to shift his research focus from descriptive studies aimed at understanding the disparity to the effective implementation of strategies aimed at addressing the disparity. Together with his mentors he has developed a training plan to address the additional skills he will for this shift. This training plan includes 1) attaining network analysis skills focused on HIV transmission dynamics in sexual networks, 2) developing field research skills including sampling in venue and internet-based settings, 3) developing mixed methods skills to inform effective implementation design, and 4) attaining knowledge and skills in community-centered implementation of evidence-based prevention strategies. The research plan is designed to identify sex partner meeting venues with ongoing HIV transmission and to explore the barriers and facilitators to accessing and achieving PrEP uptake in YBMSM within these venues Specific Aim 1 is to graph venue affiliation networks linking sex partner meeting venues reported by new MSM HIV cases in Baltimore. Specific Aim 2 is to describe the network structure and compositional characteristics of the venue affiliation networks identified in Aim 1 and, using prospective HIV testing data, to determine the association between network structure, compositional characteristics and HIV incidence and prevalence. Informed by data from the prior aims, Specific Aim 3 is to explore barriers and facilitator to accessing and achieving PrEP uptake in YBMSM in high incidence venue networks in order to interrupt HIV transmission. Through this award, the applicant will become a physician scientist skilled in mixed methods and network analysis, experienced in field research on the ground and online, and skilled in engaging communities in the application of evidence-based prevention. Together with his clinical and public health perspective on the HIV disparities affecting YBMSM, this training will uniquely position him to implement effective strategies to eliminate these disparities and improve the health of patients and their communities. Project Narrative Young Black gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (YBMSM) suffer significant racial disparities in HIV incidence in the U.S. despite advances in treatment and prevention. The purpose of this study is to identify high risk sex partner meeting venues connected by ongoing HIV transmission networks among users. Findings will provide access points for YBMSM at risk for infection. Using these data, the study will explore facilitators and barriers to accessing and achieving PrEP uptake among YBMSM who attend these venues with the goal of using PrEP to halt transmission within these networks.",Targeted PrEP Implementation: Interrupting HIV Transmission Among Young Black MSM,9431054,U01PS005115,[''],NCHHSTP,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2017,346012,0.17101678849195226
"Developing an Implementation Program to Optimize Uptake of HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis among Black Women in Primary Care Settings ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Charlene Flash is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator and national leader in eliminating health care disparities in HIV. She strives to master the development and evaluation of theory-driven approaches to bio-behavioral HIV prevention, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), among at-risk Black women. Dr. Flash will accomplish this goal through patient-oriented research, formal mentoring by recognized experts (Drs. Thomas Giordano, Kenneth Mayer, Rivet Amico, Jeffrey Cully and Adaora Adimora) and advanced training in behavioral science, mixed-methodology, and implementation science.  The applicant's K23 research goal is to develop an HIV prevention program for Black women in primary care settings that facilitates access to PrEP. The overall hypothesis is that modifiable patient and provider features influence uptake of biobehavioral prevention. Understanding the influence of these features on CDC HIV PrEP guideline uptake can guide design of an innovative, culturally relevant HIV prevention program. The Program's objective is for Black women engaged in primary care settings to be screened for risk, made aware of PrEP and be able to access PrEP via an informed and equipped provider if the patient is both high risk and interested. Addressing four NIMH high priority areas, this research integrates behavioral and biomedical approaches, incorporates context, and uses implementation science in vulnerable populations.  The first specific aim is to use patient and provider surveys and interviews, grounded in the PARiHS implementation framework, to assess how Black women and their providers approach sexual health, assess HIV risk, and perceive PrEP. The second aim is to develop a PrEP Implementation Program to increase HIV risk assessments among Black women and appropriate PrEP uptake among those at-risk. We will develop and iteratively revise a clinical algorithm to increase HIV risk assessments, PrEP discourse, and PrEP prescribing when appropriate. The algorithm will be informed by data from AIM 1, existing literature, and input from a Multidisciplinary Advisory Board that includes experts in PrEP and implementation science, clinical providers, and at risk Black women patients. The third specific aim is to use a type 3 effectiveness-implementation hybrid design with pre-post evaluation to pilot and evaluate the PrEP Implementation Program in a primary care clinic that serves Black women of low socioeconomic status living in a high HIV incidence zip code.  As additional oral, topical and injectable chemoprophylaxis agents emerge, this work will facilitate their integration into existing health care structures. This research will expand upon the principal investigator's current skills and past work, take advantage of an outstanding research and mentoring environment, and develop an independent researcher whose work decreases HIV incidence among Black women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: CDC recently issued guidelines supporting use of a highly effective biomedical intervention to prevent HIV transmission, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Although Black women in the United States bear disproportionate burden of HIV, limited data exist on how patient and provider features may influence their use of PrEP. This proposal is innovative in its use of implementation science to map out a step-wise approach to increasing PrEP access in a marginalized under-studied population.",Developing an Implementation Program to Optimize Uptake of HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis among Black Women in Primary Care Settings,9335447,K23MH109358,"['Adoption ', ' Algorithms ', ' Awareness ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Belief ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Elements ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Records ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Injectable ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Penetration ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' patient oriented research ', ' patient oriented study ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' implementation research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Chemoprophylaxis ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary care setting ', ' study population ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' ']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K23,2017,185260,0.30524552571506636
"Increasing Uptake of HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis among Young, Black MSM in the South PROJECT SUMMARY: The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to provide Latesha Elopre, MD, MSPH the essential mentorship and career development necessary to become an independent investigator whose research will contribute to decreasing health inequity among underserved and disproportionately impacted populations regarding HIV infection rates. The initial focus of her work will be in developing a behavioral intervention to increase uptake of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among young, Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Deep South. Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 50% of black MSM will become infected with HIV in their lifetime. Furthermore, the Southern United States is seeing the highest rates of new HIV infections in this population, with rates rapidly increasing for young, black MSM. Through consistent use of PrEP, a biomedical prevention tool, decreased HIV infection rates can be seen among young, Black MSM. Research focusing on increasing HIV prevention services and decreasing health disparities in HIV incidence have been high priority for the NIH. However, there have been few studies evaluating PrEP uptake among young, Black MSM in the Deep South. In concordance with prior research that has shown individual and structural factors leading to increased stigma and marginalization for black MSM, this study will be grounded in the Andersen Behavioral Model for Healthcare Utilization with subsequent individual level intervention driven by the situated Information, Motivation and Behavioral skills theoretical framework. This conceptual model will allow for investigation of core determinants of health behavior in the context of individual and societal barriers influencing health service utilization. A mixed-methods research design will aid in targeted intervention development with a more granular understanding of potential barriers for PrEP uptake. Hypothesis: Characteristics that pertain to stigma related to PrEP, HIV, race, religion and poverty as well as healthcare access will be major barriers to awareness and uptake of PrEP for young, Black MSM in the South. The specific aims for this research proposal are as follows: Aim 1: Determine critical beliefs and attitudes regarding PrEP awareness and uptake among young, Black MSM in the South. Aim 2: Determine environmental barriers for delivery of PrEP to young, black MSM in the South. Aim 3: Develop a targeted intervention to increase PrEP uptake among young, Black MSM in the South. With guidance from my mentorship team, a career development plan has been created to gain training in behavioral theory, intervention development and mixed-methods research design enabled by additional coursework, hands on training, seminars and national workshops. Upon completion of the proposed scientific aims, I will be poised to pilot a theory-guided behavioral intervention to enhance PrEP uptake among young black MSM in the U.S. Deep South supported by an R-series grant. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Disproportionately high numbers of HIV infection are seen among young, Black men who have sex with men (MSM) who live in the Southern United States. New estimates from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention predict 1 in 2 Black MSM will be infected with HIV in their lifetime. Biomedical HIV prevention strategies, such as HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), have been shown to effectively decrease rates of HIV infection by up to 92% with consistent use. The project described in this application will develop a theory- driven behavioral intervention, utilizing a mixed-methods research design, to increase uptake of PrEP among young, Black MSM in the South.","Increasing Uptake of HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis among Young, Black MSM in the South",9270924,K23MH112417,"['Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention

"Developing a Patient Navigation Intervention for PrEP Continuum of Care among Young Latino MSM PROJECT SUMMARY Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the most at-risk group for contracting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the U.S., comprising 67% of new HIV diagnoses in 2014. However, the HIV epidemic impacts some groups of MSM disproportionately. Latino MSM comprise 25.1% of new HIV infections among MSM between the ages of 13 and 29 years. The daily medication tenofovir/emtricitabine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in 2012 and has demonstrated strong efficacy in reducing the risk of HIV infection. When taken consistently, PrEP has been shown to reduce new incidence of HIV by 92%. Despite the promise of PrEP to transform HIV prevention, there remain significant barriers to PrEP use among those who would benefit the most, resulting in low rates of uptake. Although Latino MSM have reported the lowest use of PrEP (6.6%), they also reported the greatest willingness to use PrEP compared to White and Black MSM. There have been no known interventions that have been designed to assist Latino MSM with accessing PrEP-related health care or adhering to PrEP. Patient navigation may be an ideal intervention to aid in PrEP uptake among Latino MSM by assisting individuals in overcoming barriers to obtaining and using PrEP. To our knowledge, no known patient navigation programs for PrEP have been developed for Latino MSM. The objectives of this proposed study are to develop, pretest, produce, and pilot test a patient navigation intervention designed to address multiple components of the PrEP cascade among Latino MSM between the age of 18 and 29. During Phase 1, qualitative data will be collected through 30 in-depth interviews to assess needs and assets of young adult Latino MSM regarding engagement and retention in the PrEP cascade. From these findings, health care provider and staff feedback, and through the guidance of a Participatory Planning Group, a patient navigation intervention will be developed and pre-tested through 25 in-depth interviews. During Phase 2, the patient navigation intervention will be pilot-tested with 60 young adult Latino MSM. The patient navigation intervention will be compared to usual care plus written information to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and study methods, as well as the intervention's potential in improving engagement and retention in PrEP-related care. The project will investigate the following specific aims: 1) to assess the needs and assets of young adult Latino MSM regarding engagement and retention in the PrEP cascade; 2) to develop, pretest, and produce a patient navigation intervention designed to facilitate engagement and retention in the PrEP cascade among young adult Latino MSM; and 3) to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of the patient navigation intervention by comparing it to usual care to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact. The proposed study has significant public health implications and is expected to contribute to efforts to reduce HIV-related disparities and increase adherence to PrEP.

"Theoretically Based Mobile App to Increase PrEP Uptake Among MSM Abstract Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) holds great promise to reduce susceptibility to HIV infection for those who are HIV-negative and take PrEP regularly. However, PrEP initiation is serostatus dependent, and starting PrEP when risk emerges requires men who have sex with men (MSM) to maintain regular HIV testing routines and regularly assess PrEP eligibility. Currently many MSM do not test for HIV regularly, and PrEP uptake has been slow. PrEP will not have sufficient impact on HIV incidence among MSM unless it is brought to scale; PrEP coverage of 40-50% would be required to reduce HIV incidence by 25%. Today, PrEP uptake among MSM stands at 8.5%. We propose to test the efficacy of a mobile app (HealthMindr) to promote PrEP uptake in 3 US cities with substantial HIV epidemics among MSM: Atlanta, GA, Jackson, MS, and Washington, DC. The prevention app has already been developed and tested with 121 MSM; 9% of PrEP eligible MSM who used the app initiated PrEP during a 4-month follow-up period. Further, the app was found to be very acceptable to MSM. Minor enhancements to the PrEP component of the app will be made, including addition of additional PrEP information. The app will include components for self-administered risk assessments, developing and supporting a plan for frequent HIV testing, and monthly self-assessment for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) eligibility. The app will link those eligible for PrEP to services with a locator for PrEP providers, including private providers and details about services available, and with public PrEP navigators. The app will be tested in an RCT versus standard of care (referral to existing PrEP information and resources) in the three cities. The primary outcome will be rate of PrEP initiation, confirmed by tenofovir-diphosphate detection in a dried blood spot (DBS) specimen and/or photographic evidence of PrEP prescription. Project narrative A key issue for advancing comprehensive HIV prevention for MSM is how to increase PrEP uptake while sustaining high levels of HIV testing and condom use. We propose to evaluate the efficacy of a mobile application, HealthMindr, to increase PrEP uptake in the context of a package of basic prevention services for men who have sex with men in 3 US cities: Atlanta, GA, Jackson, MS, and Washington, DC.",Theoretically Based Mobile App to Increase PrEP Uptake Among MSM,9410710,R01DA045612,"['Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Cities ', ' Counseling ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Minor ', ' Study models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Privatization ', ' Diphosphates ', ' Pyrophosphates ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Suggestion ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Washington ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' uptake ', ' Spottings ', ' tool ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' condoms ', ' prevention service ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' pill ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Detection ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' active control ', ' Prevention Services Research ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' usability ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' efficacy testing ', ' surveillance study ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' ']",NIDA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,1080349,0.3756237476509248
"Project PrEP-R: Network Support to Engage and Retain Younger Black MSM in PrEP Care Project Summary/Abstract This goal of this project is to refine and pilot test a flexible PrEP Retention (PrEP-R) intervention that leverages organic social support network members of HIV-negative young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) to improve retention in PrEP care. While data exist for YBMSM on PrEP linkage, receipt, and adherence, there is a lack of empirically tested interventions on a key intermediate step: retention in PrEP care. Several existing strategies seek to address challenges to retention in HIV care, including case management, peer health navigation, and multi-modal programs. These efforts all rely on newly created network members, a traditional public health approach. What is often missing in these strategies is a coordinated attempt to harness organic social support networks. Our use of “organic” refers to a naturally existing social support network, which is distinct from newly generated support persons, e.g., assigned peer navigators or case managers. The concept of organic social support as a powerful force in the health of HIV infected persons is well documented, but has been underutilized to retain YBMSM in PrEP care. However, sexual minorities are often stigmatized and need persistent, deep, and ongoing social support, the kind that is often only available from existing confidants— friends, kin, and other persons—with whom one might share personal information and be influenced by. Flexibility of PrEP-R ensures that a support confidant (SC) is selected based on factors such as providing a supportive function (e.g., emotional support) as opposed to their status (e.g., mother). Such SCs are likely important not only to retention in PrEP care, but also to sustained health maintenance, risk reduction behavior maintenance and long-term adherence to PrEP. We have developed a brief, theoretically-grounded, culturally- sensitive PrEP-R intervention that (1) utilizes social support network visualization and network theory to help YBMSM safely identify a SC to engage in retention in PrEP care activities; (2) uses an Information-Motivation- Behavioral Skills Model targeted at the SC to activate and maintain PrEP-specific social support in the dyad; and (3) a linked PrEP-specific social support conceptual model to then drive appointment adherence among index YBMSM. Our primary aims are to: (1) Refine PrEP-R intervention protocol, materials and assessments by (1) shifting more of the intervention to focus on the SC through individual and dyadic sessions; and (2) developing a systematic procedure to generate social support of the client by engaging the SC via mini-booster cell phone sessions; and (2) Pilot test the feasibility (reach, adoption, and implementation) and initial efficacy (number of 3-month periods with 1 completed visit) of the PrEP-R intervention versus standard linkage to care at 12-months post randomization among a sample of 160 YBMSM ages 18-29. Secondary outcomes to be assessed include self-efficacy, social support, HIV/STI testing frequency and maintenance of health insurance. Secondary outcomes include self-efficacy, social support, HIV/STI testing frequency, and health insurance maintenance. This pilot study will provide objective data in support of our next step: an adequately powered RCT testing the effectiveness of PrEP-R to promote retention in PrEP primary care versus treatment as usual. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to refine and test an intervention to retain HIV negative young Black men in PrEP primary care. We do this by recruiting, informing, and motivating naturally existing social support network members to help young men keep their PrEP care appointments, which will have important public health benefits by decreasing the risk of HIV transmission.",Project PrEP-R: Network Support to Engage and Retain Younger Black MSM in PrEP Care,9349586,R34MH111392,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Adoption ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Appointment ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' indexing ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Maintenance ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mothers ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Support Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaccination ', ' Friends ', ' Case Management ', ' Family member ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Injectable ', ' Caring ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Lifestyle Risk Reduction ', ' Risk Reduction Behavior ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' Case Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Care Manager ', ' Modality ', ' brief intervention ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' Outcome ', ' Implant ', ' Network-based ', ' secondary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' financial incentive ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' sexual minority ', ' screening ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' peer support ', ' support network ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R34,2017,260852,0.2220709117138864
"Evaluating HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis implementation using an all payers claims database PROJECT SUMMARY  The HIV epidemic continues to disproportionately impact men who have sex with men (MSM) and African American populations in the United States (US). Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has demonstrated efficacy in preventing HIV acquisition among at-risk populations. Despite high efficacy, PrEP implementation across the US has been slow, and approaches to evaluate implementation and determine gaps in coverage have been limited. The goal of this study is to evaluate and inform PrEP implementation efforts with a novel “big data” approach using the Rhode Island All Payers Claims Database (APCD). APCDs are an emerging data source that contain insurance claims from Medicaid, Medicare, and most, if not all, private insurers. Rhode Island is one of the first states in the country to adopt an APCD. This study will develop and validate an algorithm to measure PrEP uptake and persistence using the RI APCD (Aim 1), describe PrEP implementation across the state including which physicians are prescribing PrEP and characteristics of the patients PrEP is being prescribed to (Aim 2), and assess the impact of insurance cost-sharing (e.g. co-pays, deductibles, and co-insurance) on PrEP uptake and persistence (Aim 3). Results of this study will provide the groundwork for the development of structural-level interventions to promote PrEP uptake among high-risk populations and inform state and federal policies pertaining to PrEP implementation. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Although pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective in preventing HIV, PrEP implementation efforts have been limited by effective approaches to evaluate uptake.

"A community pharmacy-based model to link and engage young men with Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention ABSTRACT Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and transgender women (YTW) aged 18-29 remain at high risk for HIV infection, particularly YMSM and YTW of color. Such disparities cannot be attributed to individual-level behaviors alone. Age and racial disparities have been associated with a number of social determinants of HIV, including: limited awareness, low perceived risk, small sexual networks with high density of STIs and HIV, inadequate access to HIV prevention services, and more recently poor PrEP awareness, knowledge, access, and uptake.  Although PrEP is available and approved for adults ages 18 and older, demonstration studies show that less than 15% of current PrEP users identify as Black. In a Chicago-based study, by Schneider et al., only 41% of Black YMSM and YTW surveyed were aware of PrEP, only 12% knew someone who had taken PrEP, and only 4% had used PrEP. PrEP awareness was significantly associated with having a primary care provider, participation in HIV programs or studies, having had a STI screening, and being a member of the House & Ball community. However, in 2009 only 1% of primary care providers reported ever prescribing PrEP, this increased only to 7% by 2015. Thus, although PrEP is a promising biomedical intervention for HIV prevention, its uptake among Black YMSM and YTW, two groups at risk for HIV, appears to be undermined by critical contextual factors—awareness, knowledge, and access. Innovative, low-cost, scalable structural-level interventions that address these barriers and engage hard-to-reach populations, are needed to maximize PrEP’s potential for impacting the HIV epidemic.  The proposed study seeks to develop and pilot-test a novel structural-level community pharmacy-based PrEP intervention that includes: (1) the development of a digital PrEP information kiosk, and (2) PrEP educational training and referral system for pharmacy staff. The ubiquity, accessibility, and potential for non- stigmatized, population-directed PrEP information and consultation access make community pharmacies an important venue for exploration. Ultimately, this intervention has the potential to reach and engage a large number of eligible PrEP users who might not necessarily be connected with other HIV prevention programs or venues where PrEP information is disseminated (e.g., House & Ball, LGBT). The proposed study is responsive to the NIH HIV/AIDS high priority topic by specifically addressing health disparities in the incidence of new HIV infections and access to treatment. Further, this proposal includes populations at elevated risk for HIV infection and addresses health and social issues that are clearly linked with HIV.  Study findings will directly lead to a subsequent multi-site pharmacy randomized controlled trial of the pharmacy-based PrEP intervention kiosk and pharmacy staff educational training for increasing PrEP awareness, knowledge, and initiation among Black YMSM and YTW.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and transgender women (YTW) aged 18-29, particularly those of color, are at high risk for HIV infection.

"Intervention to Promote PrEP Awareness and Equitable Prescription among Providers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over thirty years into the United States epidemic, social disparities in HIV prevalence persist, with Black Americans, and Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in particular, disproportionately affected. Intensifying HIV prevention efforts in communities of high prevalence as well as maximizing the dissemination and impact of effective interventions are among the top national priorities for addressing HIV.1,2 The proposed training plan in this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) application will provide the essential knowledge and skills that the principal investigator, Sarah K. Calabrese, PhD, needs to launch a productive career in research targeting these public health imperatives. Further, the research conducted throughout the course of this award would contribute meaningfully to the successful delivery of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP, i.e., oral antiretroviral medication for HIV prevention) in real-world clinical practice and could have far-reaching implications for equitable access across social lines. PrEP is a cutting-edge biomedical advancement that received United States Food and Drug Administration approval for prescription in July of 2012, sparking a push for its implementation in health care settings throughout the country. There has been mounting recognition of the need for provider training and education about PrEP3-7 and some discussion of cultural sensitivity being a component thereof,5 but minimal attention paid explicitly to the risk of disparate prescription practices. Documented discrimination in the prescription of antiretroviral medication for treatment purposes as well as preliminary evidence of biases in clinical judgment surrounding PrEP pose a call to action; the proposed research aims to address this call via the development and pilot testing of a single-session, group-based PrEP Awareness + Discrimination Prevention intervention for healthcare providers. The intervention will serve the dual purpose of increasing knowledge about PrEP among providers and averting discriminatory prescription practices using evidence-based strategies derived from social-cognitive psychology. The project will include a comprehensive needs assessment, including eight focus groups with potential PrEP providers from diverse clinical settings (n=48-64), six focus groups with Black MSM at risk for HIV acquisition (i.e., potential PrEP users; n=36-48), key informant interviews with healthcare providers who have experience prescribing PrEP (n=20), and a national quantitative survey of physicians (n=350). The intervention will be pilot tested in a two-armed randomized controlled trial with 80 healthcare providers seeking continuing medical education. The project will yield an intervention manual with detailed curriculum and supporting materials as well as preliminary indicators of intervention feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness, setting the stage for future refinement and evaluation in the context of a larger-scale randomized controlled trial. The training acquired by Dr. Calabrese via this timely and innovative research project, in combination with formal coursework, focused workshops, academic conferences, manuscript preparation, grant-writing, one-on-one mentorship, and other research activities, will target the following three training objectives: (1) to gain mastery in the discipline of social-cognitive psychology on the topics of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination and to obtain training in measurement of implicit bias, (2) to gain expertise in intervention development, implementation, and evaluation, and (3) to enhance statistical analysis skills for application to planned research. Dr. Calabrese will be mentored primarily by John F. Dovidio, PhD, at Yale University, with additional mentoring from Nathan B. Hansen, PhD (Yale University), Kenneth H. Mayer, MD (Harvard Medical School/The Fenway Institute), Joseph R. Betancourt, MD, MPH (Harvard Medical School), and Manya Magnus, PhD, MPH (George Washington University). Dr. Calabrese's training through the proposed K01 award will round out her expertise and fully prepare her for a career as an independent research scientist in the field of HIV prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), a prescription-based daily oral medication for primary prevention of HIV, adds an exciting new option to the growing arsenal of prevention strategies available to individuals at risk for HIV acquisition. As PrEP is introduced into real-world clinical settings, educating potential prescribers about PrEP and ensuring equitable prescription practices are essential given preliminary indicators of racial bias in PrEP-related clinical decision-making. The proposed research aims to develop and pilot test a single-session, group-based intervention for providers to increase their awareness about PrEP and promote equitable prescription practices, ultimately increasing access to PrEP and combating the spread of HIV.",Intervention to Promote PrEP Awareness and Equitable Prescription among Providers,9267532,K01MH103080,"['Acquired Immunologic

"Increasing PrEP Use in High-Risk Social Networks of African American MSM in Underserved Low-Uptake Cities Abstract  PrEP is a powerful and potentially groundbreaking HIV prevention strategy, but its public health impact will depend on widescale adoption by persons at greatest risk for contracting HIV infection. PrEP awareness and use remain especially low among African American MSM in mid-sized cities across the center of the country, and very little research has tested interventions that can increase PrEP awareness, benefit perception, and normative support—and decrease PrEP stigma and concerns—among African American MSM in these cities. PrEP can achieve its full public health potential only when its uptake among racial minority MSM in neglected mid-sized American cities is increased. In prior research, our team established that network-level interventions can reach and be used to deliver effective HIV risk reduction interventions to Black MSM in the industrial Midwest, including hard-to-reach men hidden in the community. The planned mixed- methods research will now evaluate a network intervention to increase PrEP uptake among high-risk African American MSM in Milwaukee and Cleveland, cities where HIV racial disparities are profound but PrEP use is low. In a formative research phase, in-depth interviews will be conducted with African American MSM, PrEP providers, and other key informants in each city to identify understandings, concerns, barriers, and facilitators of PrEP use. In the main intervention trial phase, 36 social networks of high-risk racial minority MSM (expected n=504 participants) will be enrolled, 18 networks per city, by recruiting high-risk initial “seeds,” members of each seed's MSM friendship network, and then two outward successive rings of their friends. All study participants will receive baseline counseling for PrEP and risk reduction. The 36 networks will then be randomized in equal numbers to intervention and comparison conditions. In each intervention condition network, a cadre of network leaders open to PrEP, trusted for advice, and highly interconnected with others will attend an intervention that educates and then provides training and guidance in diffusing messages to friends to encourage PrEP uptake, correcting PrEP misconceptions and stigma, and instilling positive PrEP norms and benefit perceptions. At baseline and 6- and 15-month followup points, participants will complete measures of PrEP use corroborated by the testing of dried blood spot specimens for tenofovir; measures of PrEP related knowledge, attitudes, perceived norms, and stage of change readiness; sexual risk practices; and substance use. We hypothesize that the network intervention will produce greater PrEP adoption by HIV- participants than that found in comparison networks. PrEP knowledge, attitudes, intentions, peer norms, and stage of change readiness will be explored as both mediators and as secondary outcomes. Intervention effects on HIV incidence will be mathematically modeled to determine its public health impact. This research will test a novel approach for increasing PrEP use among neglected racial minority MSM in mid-sized American cities who can best—and can perhaps only—be reached through their social network connections. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) regimens greatly reduce the likelihood that high-risk uninfected men who have sex with men (MSM) will contract HIV infection. However, PrEP use remains very low in mid-sized cities across the country, especially among African American MSM who may be hidden in the community and hard to reach through conventional PrEP awareness campaigns. This research will employ a social network approach for both reaching racial minority MSM in the community and delivering an intervention in which peer network leaders are taught and enlisted to increase awareness, correct misconceptions, reduce stigma, and increase benefit perception and positive attitudes of their network members toward PrEP. Results of the study will improve models for HIV prevention implementation science among African American MSM in neglected regions of the country.  ",Increasing PrEP Use in High-Risk Social Networks of African American MSM in Underserved Low-Uptake Cities,9568815,R01NR017574,"['Adoption ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Goals ', ' Happiness ', ' positive attitude ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Incidence ', ' Industrialization ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Persons ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Seeds ', ' seed ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Syphilis ', ' great pox ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' Friendships ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Diffuse ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' uptake ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Community Networks ', ' Spottings ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' behavior change ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' HIV risk ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' neglect ', ' community intervention ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Regimen ', ' Prevention trial ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' peer networks ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' support network ', ' racial minority ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NINR,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R01,2018,697720,0.3182091571784418
"The Effect of Intersecting Stigmas on PrEP Outcomes for Young Black MSM Abstract Despite recent progress, Black Americans continue to bear the most severe burden of HIV/AIDS in the nation, and young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) continue to be most affected. Antiretroviral pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been endorsed as a potentially effective part of HIV combination prevention strategies and an opportunity to reduce new infections among YBMSM. However, without significant efforts to develop age and culturally-tailored PrEP interventions for YBMSM, PrEP use may only be accessible and utilized by older, White, more affluent MSM, further exacerbating HIV disparities. Through the framework of intersectionality, the proposed research examines how various, intersectional stigmas may limit YBMSM’s ability and willingness to use PrEP. Various stigmas experienced by Black MSM (homonegativity, racism) are associated with adverse outcomes along the HIV care continuum and there is reason to believe these stigmas may also negatively affect PrEP outcomes. The proposed study aims to address the current lack of research on YBMSM’s barriers to using PrEP and gather the data necessary to inform a tailored intervention for YBMSM. The study will take place in Milwaukee, WI. In phase I, we will conduct 9 focus groups (n=72-90) with YBMSM ages 16-25 to explore YBMSM’s knowledge and perceptions of PrEP, identify individual, community and structural level factors likely to affect PrEP uptake among YBMSM, and examine YBMSM’s general healthcare utilization patterns and barriers. Additionally, we will employ a quantitative study to examine the relationship between various stigmas (racism, medical mistrust, homonegativity) and examine the effects of intersecting stigmas on knowledge and acceptance of PrEP among 300 YBMSM. We hypothesize that racism, homonegativity, and the intersection of those stigmas will predict lower knowledge of PrEP, reduced likelihood of using PrEP, and greater PrEP stigma. We also hypothesize that the relationships between various stigmas and PrEP outcomes will be moderated by resiliency and social support. In Phase II, we will use findings from Phase I and community-based participatory research methods to develop an evidence-based multi-level intervention tailored to YBMSM to be tested in a future R34. Findings from this study may not only be useful in increasing PrEP use among YBMSM, but may also be generalized to other outcomes along the care continuum. The training plan in this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) application will provide the training and research experience necessary to support Dr. Katherine Quinn’s transition to an independent HIV prevention and intervention researcher. Training includes four primary goals: build content expertise in intersectional stigma, develop mastery of complex statistical modeling for intersectionality and mixed-methods research, build expertise in intervention science, and enhance career and professional development. The training acquired by Dr. Quinn includes didactic coursework, academic conferences, manuscript preparation, independent study, grant writing workshops and other research activities. Project Narrative Young, black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may be an essential part of combination prevention strategies to curb these disparities. Stigma may be a limiting factor in the success of PrEP for YBMSM and this research will examine how intersectional stigma experienced by YBMSM may influence PrEP knowledge and uptake. The promise of PrEP can only be fully realized if we understand the factors that shape YBMSM’s engagement with PrEP and findings from this study will inform a tailored PrEP intervention for YBMSM.

"Developing a PrEP Adherence Intervention Targeting At-Risk and Substance Using Women Project Summary We aim to develop and assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy on adherence of a community-informed tenofovir/emticitrabine (TDF/FTC) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) engagement intervention among street-based female sex workers (FSWs) in Baltimore, Maryland. PrEP is a potentially empowering method of HIV protection that is safe and effective, however, there is little research to inform PrEP targeting and use among FSWs. The CDC Clinical Guidelines indicate PrEP for women engaged in sex work. Through a community participatory process, we propose developing a small group, mHealth-enhanced peer- navigator intervention, STAR-PrEP (Sex workers Take Action and Responsibility), aimed raise PrEP awareness among FSWs and to to enhance PrEP uptake and adherence. The study is informed by psychological empowerment and fundamental cause theories. The study aims to: 1). employ community engaged research activities (e.g., community forums, focus groups, component testing, in-depth interviews) to identify FSW-specific barriers to PrEP engagement and to develop a small group and mHealth enhanced SW- PrEP intervention to promote PrEP uptake and adherence among street-based HIV-negative FSWs (N=40) in Baltimore Maryland; 2) assess the STAR-PrEP’s acceptability (e.g., refusal rates, intervention engagement) and feasibility (e.g., recruitment, retention) among intervention participants (n=40), and preliminary efficacy on PrEP uptake and adherence in intervention versus comparison participants (n=40) among street-based FSWs in Baltimore, Maryland at 6-month follow-up; 2a) to explore the role of empowerment (e.g. perceived stigma, social support) and structural vulnerability (e.g., access to care) factors as correlates or possible mediators of the intervention effect on study outcomes in intervention (n=40) versus comparison participants (n=40) at 6-month follow-up; and 3) to explore predictors (i.e., homelessness, depression, drug use) of STAR- PrEP participants on monthly drug adherence among street-based FSWs (N=40) in Baltimore, Maryland at the 6-month follow up. Drug adherence will be detected by 6-monthly plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells tests. The proposal is directly responsive to RFA-MH-17-361 and addresses 3 NIH HIV/AIDS Research Priorities: 1) reducing “incidence in HIV/AIDS” among a high risk yet understudied population; 2) reducing health disparities among socially and economically marginalized group of women who are largely African American; and 3) training peer navigators to increase a “workforce to conduct high priority HIV/AIDS research."" The proposed intervention is one of the first to focus on this high-risk yet understudied population in the U.S., and is strengthened by its partnership with longstanding community healthcare providers to prescribe PrEP. Data will inform the design, recruitment, and effect size of a future R01 focused on a larger trial targeting street-based FSWs and PrEP providers. Project Relevance The proposed study will inform the development of a multifaceted PrEP adherence intervention targeting street-based female sex workers (FSWs) in Baltimore, Maryland. The study will include an extensive community engaged research activities co-led by a FSW Community Advisory Board, including FSW community forums focus groups, component testing, and in-depth interviews with community-based PrEP providers. This process will result in the development of a small group, mHealth-enhanced peer-navigator intervention, STAR-PrEP (Sex workers Take Action and Responsibility). The intervention aims to enhance PrEP awareness among FSWs as well as increase PrEP uptake and adherence among the intervention (n=40) compared to the comparison (n=40) participants, while adherence will be detected among intervention participants t detected by 6-monthly plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) tests.",Developing a PrEP Adherence Intervention Targeting At-Risk and Substance Using Women,9522180,R34DA045619,"['Awareness ', ' Baltimore ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Communities ', ' Community Workers ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Maryland ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Community Health Care ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Homelessness ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' uptake ', ' Review Literature ', ' Nature ', ' Research Priority ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Pattern ', ' Outcome Study ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' PBMC ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' empowerment ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' arm ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' navigator intervention ', ' female sex worker ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' intervention participants ', ' ']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R34,2018,245625,0.3409618744492109
"Evaluating HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis implementation using an all payers claims database PROJECT SUMMARY  The HIV epidemic continues to disproportionately impact men who have sex with men (MSM) and African American populations in the United States (US). Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has demonstrated efficacy in preventing HIV acquisition among at-risk populations. Despite high efficacy, PrEP implementation across the US has been slow, and approaches to evaluate implementation and determine gaps in coverage have been limited. The goal of this study is to evaluate and inform PrEP implementation efforts with a novel “big data” approach using the Rhode Island All Payers Claims Database (APCD). APCDs are an emerging data source that contain insurance claims from Medicaid, Medicare, and most, if not all, private insurers. Rhode Island is one of the first states in the country to adopt an APCD. This study will develop and validate an algorithm to measure PrEP uptake and persistence using the RI APCD (Aim 1), describe PrEP implementation across the state including which physicians are prescribing PrEP and characteristics of the patients PrEP is being prescribed to (Aim 2), and assess the impact of insurance cost-sharing (e.g. co-pays, deductibles, and co-insurance) on PrEP uptake and persistence (Aim 3). Results of this study will provide the groundwork for the development of structural-level interventions to promote PrEP uptake among high-risk populations and inform state and federal policies pertaining to PrEP implementation. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Although pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective in preventing HIV, PrEP implementation efforts have been limited by effective approaches to evaluate uptake. All payers claims databases (APCDs) are emerging comprehensive databases of claims from Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurers.

"Longitudinal Predictors of PrEP Use and Adherence Among Young Black MSM Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) dramatically reduces the risk of HIV infection, especially for those who are most adherent. However, for PrEP to significantly impact the HIV epidemic, those most at risk of HIV must both use and adhere to PrEP. Data suggest that a substantial proportion of men who have sex with men (MSM) stop using PrEP soon after starting; they may or may not resume use. There is also evidence that many young men may not consistently adhere to PrEP. However, we know very little about the frequency of PrEP termination, gaps in PrEP use, or lapses in prevention-effective adherence among young Black MSM (YBMSM), or about short- and long-term changes in use and adherence for these men. Additionally, we lack information about how use and adherence among YBMSM may be impacted by structural and psychosocial barriers to PrEP (including issues with health care access and insurance; low socioeconomic status and instability in employment, transportation, and housing; poor mental health; substance use; and stigma and negative social norms related to PrEP) or partner and relationship factors (such as the introduction of new partners, the development of committed relationships, perceptions of partner risk, and intimate partner violence). The overall aim of the proposed research is to use short- and long-term prospective, longitudinal data from YBMSM PrEP users to examine patterns and predictors of PrEP use and adherence, with the goal of identifying targets for PrEP interventions with this high-risk population. We will recruit 200 YBMSM (ages 18- 30) who use PrEP from Midwestern metro areas with large racial disparities in HIV (Detroit, MI; Kansas City, MO; Milwaukee, WI; and Minneapolis, MN). Men will complete surveys assessing PrEP use and adherence along with hypothesized predictors every 3 months for 1 year. Additionally, a subsample of 100 users will complete 14 days of electronic daily diaries to assess micro changes in adherence, other sexual health and risk behaviors, and key predictors. Dried blood spot tests for tenofovir will be used to objectively assess adherence, and information on HIV and STI testing and infection will be drawn from linked medical records. Through the application of modern analytic methods, this research will address the following aims: (1) Describe longitudinal changes in PrEP use and adherence among YBMSM, and associations between PrEP use and adherence and other sexual health and risk behaviors and outcomes; (2) Identify factors associated with gaps in PrEP use, PrEP termination, and poor PrEP adherence for YBMSM over 1 year; and (3) Identify factors associated with PrEP adherence at the daily level for YBMSM using daily diary surveys. We predict that gaps in PrEP use, PrEP termination, and lapses in prevention-effective adherence will be common, and that they will be associated with structural and psychosocial barriers as well as sexual partner and relationship factors. Information on how and why use and adherence vary over time will inform the development of interventions targeting PrEP uptake and adherence among YBMSM. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) dramatically reduces the risk of HIV infection, especially for those who are most adherent. However, there is evidence that a substantial proportion of men who have sex with men (MSM) stop using PrEP soon after starting, and that many users, especially young Black MSM, may not take PrEP consistently. This research will collect longitudinal survey and daily diary data from young Black MSM who use PrEP in four mid-sized Midwestern cities with large HIV disparities in order to identify changes in PrEP use and adherence over time; barriers and sexual partner factors associated with gaps in PrEP use, PrEP termination, and poor PrEP adherence; and predictors of PrEP adherence at the daily level. Information on how and why use and adherence vary over time will inform the development of interventions targeting PrEP uptake and adherence among young Black MSM.",Longitudinal Predictors of PrEP Use and Adherence Among Young Black MSM,9554543,R01MH115764,"['HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Housing ', ' Infection ', ' Insurance ', ' Kansas ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Medical Records ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Modernization ', ' Perception ', ' Protective Agents ', ' Protective Drugs ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Caring ', ' analytical method ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' social norm ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' uptake ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Spottings ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Frequencies ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' open label study ', ' open label ', ' sexual relationship ', ' cost ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' neglect ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' clinical care ', ' effective intervention ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' young man ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cities ', ' Color ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Employment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' ']",NIMH,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R01,2018,381464,0.37143629554732555
"Brown University Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program Project Summary/Abstract Assessment of current programs designed to increase diversity in STEM disciplines at Brown University has revealed the need to specifically address the critical transition from undergraduate into doctoral training programs. The goal of Brown PREP is to diversify and enrich the biomedical research endeavor by increasing the number of students enrolled in and completing doctoral training programs. Informed by best practices and lessons learned from an institutional pilot PREP program, we describe an innovative program characterized by a comprehensive and customizable set of interventions to support and advance underrepresented students' academic and career development.  Each year, our program will recruit and support eight research-oriented baccalaureate graduates from underrepresented backgrounds and provide them with interdisciplinary research experiences, individualized academic planning, professional development, and skill-building activities to increase their competitiveness and readiness for high-caliber doctoral programs. Participating departments for Brown's proposed PREP reside in the Life and Medical Sciences Division and include biology, neuroscience, psychology, public health and cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences.  In addition to intensive interdisciplinary research experiences and knowledge development, multiple mentorship and community building opportunities permeate the activities of the Brown PREP. Creating a community of scholars that will help students successfully navigate program requirements is viewed as essential to helping students reach their full potential in a short period of time. The use of Individual Development Plans (IDP) will ensure that the Brown PREP research, educational and professional development activities are specifically tailored to address each student's academic and career goals. As important, the Brown PREP will provide opportunities for faculty to engage in conversations about the importance of developing a diverse workforce in the biomedical and behavioral sciences. We have developed a comprehensive evaluation plan to assess outcomes and progress toward meeting the overall goal and aims of this project and monitor quality assurance across the proposed interventions.  As designed, the Brown PREP will increase the production of underrepresented students who obtain a doctoral degree in the biomedical sciences; institutionalize best practices on training and mentoring diverse scholars that can be shared among the Brown community and beyond; and diversify the biomedical research workforce. Project Narrative This program addresses an important societal need to increase the number of individuals from underrepresented backgrounds who enter and complete doctoral programs in the biomedical and behavioral sciences.

"Individual-level and Social Network-level Information on HIV Prevention Methods Among Young Black Women ABSTRACT Young Black women (YBW) between the ages of 18 to 24 have higher rates of HIV than any other age or race and ethnicity group of women in Los Angeles County. Social networks of YBW could be both protective and risky via social influence and sexual-health-related communication. Yet there is a dearth of literature on YBW and their social network members (SNMs), particularly regarding how social networks can be used for HIV prevention and treatment. With the current HIV/AIDS priorities of decreasing incidence of HIV and increasing the use of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among high-risk groups, examining YBW and their social networks is essential in understanding how to use these networks to implement preventive interventions such as PrEP among high-risk YBW. The proposed two-year Ruth L. Kirshstein NRSA study seeks to reduce HIV/AIDS incidence among YBW aged 18–24 by investigating condom use, HIV testing, and knowledge and perceptions of PrEP as tools to prevent HIV among YBW. To achieve this goal, the proposed study will examine 200 YBW and their SNMs to explore YBW’s social media usage and its association with sexual risk and protective behaviors (i.e., HIV testing, condom use, and interest in PrEP) among YBW (Aim 1); identify subgroups profiles of YBW based on individual- and social-network-level risk factors and investigate whether HIV testing, condom use, and interest in PrEP are key indicators of those subgroups (Aim 2); and investigate whether social network and SNM characteristics are associated with HIV testing, condom use, and interest in PrEP among YBW (Aim 3). Preliminary results from the proposed PI’s pilot study examining 78 YBW women and their SNMs (n = 1,068) revealed that YBW spoke to approximately 55% of their SNMs about sex, 32% about condoms, and 21% about testing for HIV. Additionally, individual-level descriptive statistics revealed that a majority of these women were sexually active (85%), yet very few of the sexually active women used condoms during their last sexual activity (vaginal or anal sex; 19.7%, n = 13). Furthermore, 76% of the women in the study had not heard of PrEP. After a brief description of PrEP, 47% of the YBW reported being interested in taking PrEP as a tool for HIV prevention. Due to the small sample size of YBW (n = 78), there was not enough power in the pilot study to examine associations at the individual level (i.e., condom use, HIV testing, and interest in PrEP). More importantly, individual-level risk-taking behaviors could not be correlated with network variables. Thus, these pilot study data are not sufficient to address the current aims of the proposed study. This proposed study will address these individual-level limitations by recruiting 200 YBW. Findings from this study will provide insight regarding factors not typically examined, such as YBW’s knowledge and perceptions of PrEP and the association of their social networks, HIV risk behaviors, and social media use with condom use, HIV testing, and interest in PrEP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Young Black Women (YBW) are disproportionately affected by HIV. This study will contribute to effective HIV risk behavior interventions for YBW by understanding social network-level and individual-level behavioral influences that contribute to condom use, HIV testing and interest in PrEP use among this population. Specifically, social network analysis coupled with the analysis of subgroup profiles (i.e. Latent Class Analysis) will elucidate characteristics at the individual-level and social network-level that are associated with varying levels of condom use, HIV testing, and interest in PrEP use.",Individual-level and Social Network-level Information on HIV Prevention Methods Among Young Black Women,9558176,F31MD012211,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Appointment ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Love ', ' Methods ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Science ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Social Interaction ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Friends ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' sexually active ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' Sample Size ', ' Homeless Children ', ' Homeless Youth ', ' Respondent ', ' Anal Sex ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' interest ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Emotional ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' NRSA ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' protective behavior ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Coupled ', ' high risk ', ' social media ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,F31,2018,33914,0.3082849747279953
"Novel mHealth Technologies to Enhance PrEP Adherence among Thai YMSM:  Collaborative Adaption and Evaluation ABSTRACT In Thailand, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) account for 41% of new HIV infections with an increasing trend in infections over time. Young MSM (YMSM) are at a significantly greater risk of HIV infection than older MSM with YMSM, ages 15-21, experiencing a 12.1% rate of new HIV infections. There is an urgent need to implement novel behavioral and biomedical interventions for YMSM in Thailand that are culturally and developmentally appropriate, engaging for youth, and scalable. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) provides a strong preventative benefit to youth at-risk for HIV infection and there is overwhelming evidence supporting its efficacy. While daily, oral PrEP adherence is highly correlated with its efficacy in clinical trials, adherence rates are variable. In real-world practice settings, PrEP adherence has been found to be lower among youth. Given that YMSM are disproportionately affected by HIV in Thailand, interventions are needed that improve adherence to oral PrEP among this population, thereby maximizing its preventative benefits. To address this need, we propose a collaboration between Duke University, the Thai Red Cross- AIDS Research Centre (TRCARC) and the University of North Carolina- Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). The research team will adapt a theory-based smartphone app to improve PrEP adherence among YMSM in Thailand and conduct a pilot study to assess study feasibility, acceptability, and potential impact. The adapted smartphone app, CHARGE, will utilize social networking and game-based mechanics as well as evidenced-based features to improve PrEP adherence among Thai YMSM, 16-24. In order to adapt the app, we will conduct formative research in Thailand including focus group and Youth Advisory Board discussions with YMSM and interviews with key informants who provide services to YMSM to ensure the app addresses individual, contextual, and cultural factors related to PrEP adherence. Usability testing will assess users’ comprehension of the educational content, understanding and use of intervention features, and overall impressions of app relevance and appeal. After any needed app revisions, a 6-month pilot study will be conducted with 60 YMSM initiating PrEP. Participants will be randomized into the CHARGE intervention arm or PrEP standard of care consistent with TRCARC guidelines. The primary outcomes will include study feasibility and acceptability. The secondary outcomes will include PrEP adherence as measured by intracellular levels of tenofovir-diphosphate and emtricitabine triphosphate from dried blood spots. Built on a successful, evidence-based platform designed by our collaborating technology partner, Ayogo, and tested by the study team, CHARGE will be flexible and responsive to changes in technology and changes in PrEP practice standards and guideline recommendations. We have proposed a strong research capacity building plan that will enhance the scientific and technological capabilities of TRCARC and other community based organizations in Thailand to develop, implement, and evaluate mHealth interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) represents a promising strategy for reducing HIV infections among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) in Thailand; however, PrEP efficacy is highly correlated with adherence and adherence among young populations is low. There are currently no proven interventions to promote PrEP adherence among YMSM specifically designed for the Thai context. We will adapt a novel mobile phone application (app) platform that utilizes game mechanics and social networking features to improve PrEP adherence for Thai YMSM and conduct a pilot study to test its feasibility, acceptability, and potential impact.",Novel mHealth Technologies to Enhance PrEP Adherence among Thai YMSM:  Collaborative Adaption and Evaluation,9553052,R21TW010965,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Boredom ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Immersion Investigative Technique ', ' Immersion ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' North Carolina ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Diphosphates ', ' Pyrophosphates ', ' Recommendation ', ' Red Cross ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thailand ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' tripolyphosphate ', ' triphosphate ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Social Network ', ' Comprehension ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Gays ', ' Collaborations ', ' Spottings ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Oral ', ' Source ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' impression ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Health Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' emtricitabine ', "" beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine "", ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' trend ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' older men ', ' usability ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' social participation ', ' social involvement ', ' social engagement ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' practice setting ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' ']",FIC,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,215392,0.29714454003375
"Characterizing the HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis care continuum for African American and Hispanic/Latino men who have sex with men PROJECT SUMMARY  Young African American (AA) and Hispanic/Latino (H/L) MSM bear a disproportionate share of the HIV disease burden in the United States (US). Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective in reducing HIV acquisition risks among MSM, but its ability to reduce HIV acquisition among AA and H/L MSM hinges on optimal implementation and expanded use in “real-world” clinical settings. Preliminary studies demonstrate that AA and H/L initiate PrEP and are retained in PrEP care at lower rates than their White counterparts, but little is known about longer-term adherence and retention in PrEP care among AA and H/L MSM. The manner in which structural, social, and individual level factors impact PrEP outcomes in real-world settings, particularly among young AA and H/L MSM, are not yet well understood. MSM who initiate PrEP may change behaviors (e.g., enter a monogamous relationship with an HIV negative partner) and no longer be indicated for PrEP. Furthermore, it is largely unknown why individuals, especially AA and H/L MSM, are not retained in PrEP care which complicates development of appropriate interventions to enhance retention in PrEP care. This proposed study follows a longitudinal, observational cohort (n=450) of White, AA and H/L MSM in real-world PrEP programs in Mississippi, Missouri, and Rhode Island to both characterize a PrEP care continuum and predict why MSM are sub-optimally adherent or lost to care, with a focus on measuring racial and ethnic disparities (Specific Aim 1). We will conduct individual interviews with MSM who are prescribed PrEP but sub-optimally adherent or drop out of PrEP care (Specific Aim 2) to elucidate reasons for sub-optimal adherence and retention and to identify components of potential interventions to improve adherence and retention in care. Using data from our longitudinal cohort, we will perform microsimulations in the context of an agent-based model to evaluate the impact of sub-optimal PrEP adherence and retention in care on HIV incidence in three diverse US settings. We will then predict the impact of potential interventions on PrEP care continuum outcomes (Specific Aim 3). PROJECT NARRATIVE  Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in preventing HIV transmission among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM). However, preliminary studies show that young African American and Hispanic/Latino MSM are retained in PrEP care at lower rates than their White counterparts. This study will follow a large, real-world cohort of MSM enrolled across three diverse United States settings to characterize rates of adherence and retention in PrEP care for young White, African American and Hispanic/Latino MSM, reasons for suboptimal adherence and retention in care, and the impact of different interventions to enhance adherence and retention in PrEP care outcomes on HIV incidence.",Characterizing the HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis care continuum for African American and Hispanic/Latino men who have sex with men,9565673,R01MH114657,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geography ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Mississippi ', ' Missouri ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' Seasons ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Gays ', ' uptake ', ' Spottings ', ' programs ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Drops ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' prospective ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' FDA approved ', ' primary outcome ', ' clinical infrastructure ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' retention rate ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' ']",NIMH,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R01,2018,668799,0.2793831013845346
"A community pharmacy-based model to link and engage young men with Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention ABSTRACT Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and transgender women (YTW) aged 18-29 remain at high risk for HIV infection, particularly YMSM and YTW of color. Such disparities cannot be attributed to individual-level behaviors alone. Age and racial disparities have been associated with a number of social determinants of HIV, including: limited awareness, low perceived risk, small sexual networks with high density of STIs and HIV, inadequate access to HIV prevention services, and more recently poor PrEP awareness, knowledge, access, and uptake.  Although PrEP is available and approved for adults ages 18 and older, demonstration studies show that less than 15% of current PrEP users identify as Black. In a Chicago-based study, by Schneider et al., only 41% of Black YMSM and YTW surveyed were aware of PrEP, only 12% knew someone who had taken PrEP, and only 4% had used PrEP. PrEP awareness was significantly associated with having a primary care provider, participation in HIV programs or studies, having had a STI screening, and being a member of the House & Ball community. However, in 2009 only 1% of primary care providers reported ever prescribing PrEP, this increased only to 7% by 2015. Thus, although PrEP is a promising biomedical intervention for HIV prevention, its uptake among Black YMSM and YTW, two groups at risk for HIV, appears to be undermined by critical contextual factors—awareness, knowledge, and access. Innovative, low-cost, scalable structural-level interventions that address these barriers and engage hard-to-reach populations, are needed to maximize PrEP’s potential for impacting the HIV epidemic.  The proposed study seeks to develop and pilot-test a novel structural-level community pharmacy-based PrEP intervention that includes: (1) the development of a digital PrEP information kiosk, and (2) PrEP educational training and referral system for pharmacy staff. The ubiquity, accessibility, and potential for non- stigmatized, population-directed PrEP information and consultation access make community pharmacies an important venue for exploration. Ultimately, this intervention has the potential to reach and engage a large number of eligible PrEP users who might not necessarily be connected with other HIV prevention programs or venues where PrEP information is disseminated (e.g., House & Ball, LGBT). The proposed study is responsive to the NIH HIV/AIDS high priority topic by specifically addressing health disparities in the incidence of new HIV infections and access to treatment. Further, this proposal includes populations at elevated risk for HIV infection and addresses health and social issues that are clearly linked with HIV.  Study findings will directly lead to a subsequent multi-site pharmacy randomized controlled trial of the pharmacy-based PrEP intervention kiosk and pharmacy staff educational training for increasing PrEP awareness, knowledge, and initiation among Black YMSM and YTW.   PROJECT NARRATIVE Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and transgender women (YTW) aged 18-29, particularly those of color, are at high risk for HIV infection. The proposed study will develop and pilot test a novel pharmacy-based intervention that employs a digital information kiosk and educational training and referral system located in local community pharmacies to encourage improved provision of information on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in populations at high risk for HIV infection.",A community pharmacy-based model to link and engage young men with Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention,9567619,R21MH111408,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Chicago ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Pharmacy ', ' Consultations ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Motivation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Risk ', ' Sex Education ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Syringes ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' ranpirnase ', ' P30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' uptake ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' prevention service ', ' member ', ' payment ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' information kiosk ', ' high risk ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' arm ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' young man ', ' screening ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' transgender women ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' digital media ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2018,204461,0.3685007168813735
"Developing a Women-Focused PrEP Intervention for HIV Prevention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The HIV epidemic among women in the United States (US) is a major public health issue and Black and Hispanic women disproportionately affected. Many women at high risk for acquiring HIV infection are not aware of an effective HIV prevention option. An oral antiretroviral medication is now available by prescription for pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Oral PrEP is an efficacious, self-administered, woman-controlled, HIV prevention product. There is a wide gap between recommended use of this effective biomedical HIV prevention method and actual care for women at high risk for acquiring HIV - a gap that needs to be closed in order to avoid worsening already glaring HIV health disparities among women in the US. Alarmingly, there are currently no interventions in the US to promote PrEP uptake among women. The long term goal is to develop effective approaches to support PrEP use and reduce HIV acquisition among high risk women and thereby reduce HIV health disparities. We propose that a theory-based, contextually relevant behavioral intervention combined with linkage to health care and social services, with text message support for adherence, would be feasible and acceptable and could improve PrEP uptake among high risk women. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate an intervention to promote PrEP uptake. Since varying HIV prevention public policy landscapes may also be a factor influencing PrEP uptake, this study will be conducted in two large metropolitan areas with local HIV rates that greatly exceed the national average but with different PrEP public policy and access landscapes. The aims are to : 1.Conduct formative research (40 in-depth interviews and 102 surveys) to identify the association of social-cognitive characteristics, including pre-disposing (e.g., PrEP knowledge, attitudes, norms, self-efficacy and beliefs), enabling (e.g., perceived access to care) and need (perceived HIV risk, risk compensation) with intention of PrEP uptake (initiate, adhere) and assess how these factors are influenced by relevant background factors (e.g., socio-demographics, resources, vulnerability factors). 2. Use findings from Aim 1 to develop an individually-tailored intervention for women to promote PrEP uptake behaviors (initiate, adhere), connect to local PrEP providers, link to community resources that address personal and social barriers to PrEP uptake, and provide a text-message reminder system to support PrEP adherence. 3. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention in a pilot trial (n= 80). The secondary outcomes are to: a) examine PrEP uptake intention & behavior; b) evaluate satisfaction in accessing health care for PrEP, comparing the two sites, and in using a text-message reminder system to support PrEP adherence. Our novel approach combines proven health promotion strategies, linkage to care and technology for substantive impact. This research will advance our understanding of bio-behavioral HIV prevention strategies in heavily affected communities within different PrEP policy and access landscapes. . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed research is relevant to public health because it will improve understanding of the factors that affect uptake of currently underutilized but potentially life-saving services and offers an intervention to close the gap between optimal and typical care. The project is relevant to the NIH Plan for HIV-Related Research because it will develop and evaluate a novel targeted theory-based intervention, which promotes salient individual factors and access to needed services to address racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in HIV acquisition.",Developing a Women-Focused PrEP Intervention for HIV Prevention,9537674,R34MH108437,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Communities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Epidemic ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Manuals ', ' Methods ', ' Study models ', ' Morbidity -

"Project PrEP-R: Network Support to Engage and Retain Younger Black MSM in PrEP Care Project Summary/Abstract This goal of this project is to refine and pilot test a flexible PrEP Retention (PrEP-R) intervention that leverages organic social support network members of HIV-negative young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) to improve retention in PrEP care. While data exist for YBMSM on PrEP linkage, receipt, and adherence, there is a lack of empirically tested interventions on a key intermediate step: retention in PrEP care. Several existing strategies seek to address challenges to retention in HIV care, including case management, peer health navigation, and multi-modal programs. These efforts all rely on newly created network members, a traditional public health approach. What is often missing in these strategies is a coordinated attempt to harness organic social support networks. Our use of “organic” refers to a naturally existing social support network, which is distinct from newly generated support persons, e.g., assigned peer navigators or case managers. The concept of organic social support as a powerful force in the health of HIV infected persons is well documented, but has been underutilized to retain YBMSM in PrEP care. However, sexual minorities are often stigmatized and need persistent, deep, and ongoing social support, the kind that is often only available from existing confidants— friends, kin, and other persons—with whom one might share personal information and be influenced by. Flexibility of PrEP-R ensures that a support confidant (SC) is selected based on factors such as providing a supportive function (e.g., emotional support) as opposed to their status (e.g., mother). Such SCs are likely important not only to retention in PrEP care, but also to sustained health maintenance, risk reduction behavior maintenance and long-term adherence to PrEP. We have developed a brief, theoretically-grounded, culturally- sensitive PrEP-R intervention that (1) utilizes social support network visualization and network theory to help YBMSM safely identify a SC to engage in retention in PrEP care activities; (2) uses an Information-Motivation- Behavioral Skills Model targeted at the SC to activate and maintain PrEP-specific social support in the dyad; and (3) a linked PrEP-specific social support conceptual model to then drive appointment adherence among index YBMSM. Our primary aims are to: (1) Refine PrEP-R intervention protocol, materials and assessments by (1) shifting more of the intervention to focus on the SC through individual and dyadic sessions; and (2) developing a systematic procedure to generate social support of the client by engaging the SC via mini-booster cell phone sessions; and (2) Pilot test the feasibility (reach, adoption, and implementation) and initial efficacy (number of 3-month periods with 1 completed visit) of the PrEP-R intervention versus standard linkage to care at 12-months post randomization among a sample of 160 YBMSM ages 18-29. Secondary outcomes to be assessed include self-efficacy, social support, HIV/STI testing frequency and maintenance of health insurance. Secondary outcomes include self-efficacy, social support, HIV/STI testing frequency, and health insurance maintenance. This pilot study will provide objective data in support of our next step: an adequately powered RCT testing the effectiveness of PrEP-R to promote retention in PrEP primary care versus treatment as usual. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to refine and test an intervention to retain HIV negative young Black men in PrEP primary care. We do this by recruiting, informing, and motivating naturally existing social support network members to help young men keep their PrEP care appointments, which will have important public health benefits by decreasing the risk of HIV transmission.",Project PrEP-R: Network Support to Engage and Retain Younger Black MSM in PrEP Care,9519034,R34MH111392,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Appointment ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' indexing ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Maintenance ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mothers ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Support Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaccination ', ' Friends ', ' Case Management ', ' Family member ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Injectable ', ' Caring ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Lifestyle Risk Reduction ', ' Risk Reduction Behavior ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' Case Manager ', ' Case Management Nurse ', ' Care Manager ', ' Modality ', ' brief intervention ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' Outcome ', ' Implant ', ' Network-based ', ' secondary outcome ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' monetary incentive ', ' financial reward ', ' financial incentive ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' young man ', ' sexual minority ', ' screening ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' peer support ', ' support network ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R34,2018,219634,0.2220709117138864
"Increasing Uptake of HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis among Young, Black MSM in the South PROJECT SUMMARY: The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to provide Latesha Elopre, MD, MSPH the essential mentorship and career development necessary to become an independent investigator whose research will contribute to decreasing health inequity among underserved and disproportionately impacted populations regarding HIV infection rates. The initial focus of her work will be in developing a behavioral intervention to increase uptake of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among young, Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Deep South. Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 50% of black MSM will become infected with HIV in their lifetime. Furthermore, the Southern United States is seeing the highest rates of new HIV infections in this population, with rates rapidly increasing for young, black MSM. Through consistent use of PrEP, a biomedical prevention tool, decreased HIV infection rates can be seen among young, Black MSM. Research focusing on increasing HIV prevention services and decreasing health disparities in HIV incidence have been high priority for the NIH. However, there have been few studies evaluating PrEP uptake among young, Black MSM in the Deep South. In concordance with prior research that has shown individual and structural factors leading to increased stigma and marginalization for black MSM, this study will be grounded in the Andersen Behavioral Model for Healthcare Utilization with subsequent individual level intervention driven by the situated Information, Motivation and Behavioral skills theoretical framework. This conceptual model will allow for investigation of core determinants of health behavior in the context of individual and societal barriers influencing health service utilization. A mixed-methods research design will aid in targeted intervention development with a more granular understanding of potential barriers for PrEP uptake. Hypothesis: Characteristics that pertain to stigma related to PrEP, HIV, race, religion and poverty as well as healthcare access will be major barriers to awareness and uptake of PrEP for young, Black MSM in the South. The specific aims for this research proposal are as follows: Aim 1: Determine critical beliefs and attitudes regarding PrEP awareness and uptake among young, Black MSM in the South. Aim 2: Determine environmental barriers for delivery of PrEP to young, black MSM in the South. Aim 3: Develop a targeted intervention to increase PrEP uptake among young, Black MSM in the South. With guidance from my mentorship team, a career development plan has been created to gain training in behavioral theory, intervention development and mixed-methods research design enabled by additional coursework, hands on training, seminars and national workshops. Upon completion of the proposed scientific aims, I will be poised to pilot a theory-guided behavioral intervention to enhance PrEP uptake among young black MSM in the U.S. Deep South supported by an R-series grant. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Disproportionately high numbers of HIV infection are seen among young, Black men who have sex with men (MSM) who live in the Southern United States. New estimates from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention predict 1 in 2 Black MSM will be infected with HIV in their lifetime. Biomedical HIV prevention strategies, such as HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), have been shown to effectively decrease rates of HIV infection by up to 92% with consistent use. The project described in this application will develop a theory- driven behavioral intervention, utilizing a mixed-methods research design, to increase uptake of PrEP among young, Black MSM in the South.","Increasing Uptake of HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis among Young, Black MSM in the South",9421560,K23MH112417,"['Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', '

"Accelerating PrEP Diffusion through Network Change Agents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early evidence exists of disparities in Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) knowledge, PrEP seeking behavior and PrEP adoption based on race. Black communities and in particular, younger Black MSM (YBMSM) have limited PrEP engagement. Evidence of few Black PrEP users is of concern with <15% of PrEP clients in Washington DC and New York City identifying as Black in PrEP demonstration/implementation projects. This finding is in the context of YBMSM leading new infections in these cities (and nationally). Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of PrEP clients nationally are privately insured and older - two characteristics incongruous with current HIV incidence. So while PrEP is promising; real-world PrEP use faces major implementation challenges.  Over the past two decades, the most widely used network-based intervention for HIV prevention has been the opinion leader (OL) model or variants of it. This approach includes training popular members from a target population to promote HIV prevention messages through interpersonal communication. The effectiveness of the OL model can be limited by several factors, including: heterogeneous and overlapping networks, inadequate network assessments, and the OL's public position which often requires she/he maintain conformity to the status quo. Consequently, identifying those who connect across groups of otherwise disconnected individuals (hereafter ""network bridges""), may be an alternative and efficient way to use network information to accelerate behavior change as has been demonstrated in other settings.  This proposal moves beyond traditional OL and peer outreach models by aiming to recruit change agents based upon their structural position in a social network, in this case Facebook, in order to accelerate diffusion of PrEP. This framework is further important for measuring the potential of bridging network members as they may be the earliest innovation adopters and are likely to be more willing to challenge the existing status quo. Such bridges have structural advantages that have led to increased communication, innovation and efficiency in workplace settings; however, such bridging impact in public health contexts is understudied.  We propose to address these knowledge gaps and intervene by building upon two recent studies through three phases. Phase I expands the use of Facebook for accurately characterizing a YBMSM network using a hybrid network data collection approach developed and implemented by the PI. Phase II identifies, recruits and trains change agents based upon their structural position (e.g., bridging, central, or other positions). Phase III measures and evaluates three stages of PrEP diffusion as promoted by the same agents. Our interdisciplinary team has expertise with PrEP implementation (Schneider), bridging metrics (Valente), intervention training (Bouris, Hill), social network analysis (Schneider, Valente, Goodreau), ethics (Karnik) and diffusion (Valente, Khanna). The proposed research will advance current understandings of diffusion of PrEP innovation and if successful, is structured to impact urban HIV epicenters with alarming rates of HIV infection in YBMSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed intervention will utilize bridging network members within a large young Black MSM Facebook network to accelerate the diffusion of PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) knowledge and early adoption in this same network. If successful, this project has the potential to translate a highly efficacious biomedical intervention into an impactful one in a sub-population at highest risk for HIV infection in the United States.",Accelerating PrEP Diffusion through Network Change Agents,9419288,R01AI120700,"['Adoption ', ' Behavior ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Client ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diffusion ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"The Southern Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Cohort Study: Longitudinal PrEP Initiation and Adherence among Parolees PROJECT ABSTRACT The estimated HIV prevalence among criminal justice (CJ) involved individuals is three times higher than the general population. Parolees on post-release supervision after release experience multi-level obstacles (e.g., lack of access to housing, employment) that act as barriers to HIV prevention efforts, making existing approaches to HIV prevention insufficient for reducing HIV incidence. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a once daily medication (emtricitabine/tenofovir, FTC/TDF) that has demonstrated efficacy in preventing HIV among at-risk groups. Little is known about PrEP knowledge, acceptability, initiation, and sustained use among parolees recently released from prison or how these patterns vary by individual (HIV risk factor, sociodemographic characteristics), social (stigma, social support), and structural (housing, employment) factors. Therefore, we propose to conduct an observational, multi-site cohort study in North Carolina, Kentucky, and Florida—the Southern Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis [PrEP] Cohort Study among Parolees (SPECS-P). This study is guided by the Social Ecological Model and the NIMHD Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework, which both have a focus extending beyond the individual and acknowledge that multi-level (individual, social, and structural) factors play a role in the perpetuation of persistent health disparities. The specific aims of the proposed study are: 1) characterize PrEP knowledge and acceptability among parolees; 2) identify the multi-level factors that predict PrEP initiation and sustained use among parolees; 3) qualitatively assess the multi-level factors that affect PrEP acceptability, initiation and sustained use to inform future intervention development. The proposed project will be the first observational cohort study that includes a CJ involved population at extreme risk for HIV acquisition. Our study is aligned with the following high priority topics as defined by the NIH, NIMHD Science Visioning, and Office of AIDS Research: a) advancing evaluation of approaches to improve minority health or to reduce health disparities; and b) reducing incidence of HIV/AIDS and implementing strategies to improve entry into prevention services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Criminal justice involved individuals are at increased risk of HIV acquisition. Innovative HIV prevention strategies are urgently needed.

"Developing a Patient Navigation Intervention for PrEP Continuum of Care among Young Latino MSM PROJECT SUMMARY Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the most at-risk group for contracting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the U.S., comprising 67% of new HIV diagnoses in 2014. However, the HIV epidemic impacts some groups of MSM disproportionately. Latino MSM comprise 25.1% of new HIV infections among MSM between the ages of 13 and 29 years. The daily medication tenofovir/emtricitabine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in 2012 and has demonstrated strong efficacy in reducing the risk of HIV infection. When taken consistently, PrEP has been shown to reduce new incidence of HIV by 92%. Despite the promise of PrEP to transform HIV prevention, there remain significant barriers to PrEP use among those who would benefit the most, resulting in low rates of uptake. Although Latino MSM have reported the lowest use of PrEP (6.6%), they also reported the greatest willingness to use PrEP compared to White and Black MSM. There have been no known interventions that have been designed to assist Latino MSM with accessing PrEP-related health care or adhering to PrEP. Patient navigation may be an ideal intervention to aid in PrEP uptake among Latino MSM by assisting individuals in overcoming barriers to obtaining and using PrEP. To our knowledge, no known patient navigation programs for PrEP have been developed for Latino MSM. The objectives of this proposed study are to develop, pretest, produce, and pilot test a patient navigation intervention designed to address multiple components of the PrEP cascade among Latino MSM between the age of 18 and 29. During Phase 1, qualitative data will be collected through 30 in-depth interviews to assess needs and assets of young adult Latino MSM regarding engagement and retention in the PrEP cascade. From these findings, health care provider and staff feedback, and through the guidance of a Participatory Planning Group, a patient navigation intervention will be developed and pre-tested through 25 in-depth interviews. During Phase 2, the patient navigation intervention will be pilot-tested with 60 young adult Latino MSM. The patient navigation intervention will be compared to usual care plus written information to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and study methods, as well as the intervention's potential in improving engagement and retention in PrEP-related care. The project will investigate the following specific aims: 1) to assess the needs and assets of young adult Latino MSM regarding engagement and retention in the PrEP cascade; 2) to develop, pretest, and produce a patient navigation intervention designed to facilitate engagement and retention in the PrEP cascade among young adult Latino MSM; and 3) to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of the patient navigation intervention by comparing it to usual care to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact. The proposed study has significant public health implications and is expected to contribute to efforts to reduce HIV-related disparities and increase adherence to PrEP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Young adult Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk of contract human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

"Developing a PrEP Screening Instrument for Identification/Referral of High-Risk MSM in Primary Care Project Abstract A significant public health development, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is now being widely promoted as a prevention strategy for individuals in high-risk groups, such as men who have sex with men who report substance-use (past 6-month illegal drug use and/or heavy alcohol use). While this is an exciting development, rapid identification of these high-risk patients and the ability to provide brief consultation and prescription or referral for PrEP services by primary care staff remains a major concern. The proposed mixed methods study aims to develop and pilot-test a PrEP screening instrument for facilitating PrEP uptake among substance-using MSM that will be integrated into clinic workflow based on provider-identified barriers and facilitators to sexual-health screening. The study will take place in a single primary care clinic contained within a larger integrated healthcare delivery system, Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC). Identification of both the provider- and patient-level barriers to PrEP uptake among high-risk substance-using MSM within a large integrated healthcare system will inform future intervention efforts aimed at mitigating HIV health disparities. The proposed 2-year pilot study will involve the collection of preliminary data to inform the development of a larger formal evaluation study. This project is significant in that it seeks to develop and test a screening instrument that will be administered to patients during appointment check-in and made available to their primary care provider for the rapid identification of substance-using MSM at high-risk for HIV acquisition in order to facilitate PrEP prescription/referral. This project is innovative in its focus on the identification of potential provider-, patient-, and system-level barriers to PrEP uptake among these patients.

"Following a U.S. National Cohort of Vulnerable Men to Improve HIV Prevention and Care Project Summary  RFA-AI-16-031 (LITE) is designed to address critical needs in HIV prevention research by using innovative technology to enroll and follow large-scale epidemiological cohorts of those at highest risk of infection. The proposed project will utilize established Internet-based strategies, previously used successfully by the research team, to enroll a sample of 5,000 high-risk HIV-negative gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM) ages 16 to 49—the population representing the highest percentage of new infections annually—and follow them prospectively for four years. The design features of our proposal were chosen specifically to: (a) identify individual-, network-, and contextual-level predictors and correlates of HIV seroconversion, (b) identify missed HIV prevention opportunities among those seroconverting during the course of the study, and, thus (c) inform interventions to further reduce acquisition and transmission.  We define “high-risk” as meeting CDC guidelines for PrEP treatment, but not taking PrEP. Participants will complete annual self-administered at-home rapid HIV testing (results submitted via digital photo of the test paddle) as well as brief (~20 min) at-home computerized surveys. In addition to being referred for treatment, study participants who seroconvert will complete a semi-structured telephone interview to identify missed HIV prevention opportunities and the contextual factors involved. We will monitor newly diagnosed participants' movement through the HIV care continuum. Based on current incidence rates, we anticipate accumulating ~252 infections during the study; however, because we are targeting high-risk men, this number could be higher. Aim 1 (UG3 Phase): Establish a cohort of 5,000 high-risk HIV-negative GBM who are not on PrEP, all of  whom complete baseline online surveys and at-home self-administered HIV testing, as well as consent for  longitudinal follow-up. Determine PrEP uptake and HIV incidence 12 months after study enrollment.  Supplemental Aims: Using the cross sectional data from GBM deemed ineligible during screening for study eligibility: Sup. Aim 1a—Estimate the uptake of PrEP; and Sup. Aim 1b—Characterize missed HIV  prevention opportunities (e.g., reasons for no prior PrEP use) among recent HIV seroconverters. Aim 2 (UH3 Phase): Follow the cohort for four years to characterize (2a) individual/network/contextual-level  determinants of PrEP uptake/discontinuation; (2b) new HIV seroconversions and missed HIV prevention  opportunities, including individual/network/contextual-level determinants; (2c) racial/ethnic disparities in  HIV incidence and their trends over time; and (2d) the influence of PrEP uptake on racial/ethnic disparities. Project Summary  This study will characterize HIV incidence and PrEP in a U.S. national sample of 5000 vulnerable men at risk for HIV. We will use technology-mediated methods to follow the sample for four years. Because participation in research studies that include frequent in-person contact with research personnel can impact participant behavior in ways that make them less representative of the high-risk populations from which they were drawn, we will utilize technological approaches to facilitate participation that are minimally invasive, and that incentivizes participation with nominal behavioral interference.",Following a U.S. National Cohort of Vulnerable Men to Improve HIV Prevention and Care,9531250,UG3AI133675,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Color ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Geography ', ' Hawthorne Effect ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Incentives ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Gays ', ' uptake ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Test Result ', ' psychosocial ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' meetings ', ' innovative technologies ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' minimally invasive ', ' screening ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' seroconversion ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Time trend ', ' urban setting ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIAID,GRADUATE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH POLICY,UG3,2018,1460956,0.25580151886755015
"Multilevel determinants of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) utilization and health disparities among Black and Hispanic women Women constitute a substantial proportion (20%) of new HIV diagnoses in the U.S., with the majority of infections occurring in women of color: Black and Latina women together account for 77% of newly diagnosed women nationally but represent 30% of the female population. Gender-based social inequalities combined with men’s control over HIV prevention methods, such as condoms and viral suppression, have traditionally limited women’s options with regard to self-protective risk behavior. HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken as a once-daily pill (Truvada) represents an historic breakthrough in HIV prevention for women, as it is the first commercially available effective method that is independent of the sexual act and can be controlled by women. Yet, only about 4% of women who are at high risk of HIV are taking the drug. Moreover, despite being at greatest risk for HIV Black and Latina women are the least likely to take PrEP. Women of color thus confront dual HIV-related health disparities: they have disproportionately high rates of HIV infection but disproportionately low rates of PrEP use for HIV prevention. The reasons for the low PrEP use among Black and Latina women are not well-understood. To address this gap, we propose a mixed methods longitudinal cohort study with the following specific aims: (1) characterize the PrEP care continuum (PrEP-CC; awareness, linkage, uptake, retention and adherence) among women at high risk for HIV, including health disparities; (2) identify determinants at multiple levels (societal, healthcare setting, community, interpersonal, individual) associated with PrEP-CC outcomes, including health disparities; (3) determine which healthcare provision strategies and programs promote improvement of PrEP-CC outcomes for women; and (4) explore providers’ attitudes, perspectives, practices, and environments that shape PrEP provision behavior and patient interactions. A conceptual framework integrating socioecological theory with the Gelberg-Andersen behavioral model and the Theory of Gender and Power will guide this work. The study will be conducted in two cities in New York State: New York City and Rochester. New York State has the second largest racial health disparity in HIV in the nation. A cohort (N=360) of women (80% minority) who are either taking PrEP or eligible for PrEP will be enrolled and assessed quarterly for 12 months to obtain survey, biometric, and medical record data. Sampling and recruitment strategies will involve respondent driven sampling methods in combination with time-location sampling. Community-level socioeconomic data and healthcare site- level data will also be obtained. Analyses of quantitative data will estimate within- and between-subject effects of multilevel predictors on PrEP-CC outcomes. Time-to-event analysis will also be employed to model stages along the PrEP-CC. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with a subsample of 50 women (stratified by PrEP use and race/ethnicity), and 18 clinical providers to provide contextual data for triangulation. Findings from this study will provide an evidence-base upon which to develop and evaluate interventions, programs and services for women of color to address HIV and PrEP outcomes and health disparities. Public Health Relevance: The use of antiretroviral medication—brand name Truvada—for the prevention of HIV (pre-exposure prophylaxis; PrEP) among Black and Latina women in the U.S. has the potential to significantly reduce disproportionately high rates of HIV in these groups. However, adoption of PrEP by women of color has been very limited, thereby reducing the public health benefit of PrEP to address racial and ethnic disparities in HIV transmission among women. The proposed study is designed to provide a knowledge base regarding key obstacles and facilitators of PrEP utilization that can be applied to develop effective PrEP interventions and delivery models for Black and Latina women.",Multilevel determinants of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) utilization and health disparities among Black and Hispanic women,9657390,R01MD013553,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Cities ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Decision Making ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Physician Executives ', ' Medical Directors ', ' Medical Records ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Optimizing PrEP Utilization among Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Using Women of Color Project Summary As we edge closer to the half century mark of the HIV epidemic, the disproportionate effect on women of color in the U.S. continues to be jolting. Women overall have been at a disadvantage in the epidemic due to gender differences and norms that shape biological, social and economic vulnerability. Racial and ethnic disparities magnify the risk. Co-factors such as alcohol and other drug (AOD) use intersect and reinforce other comorbidities. Living in a high prevalence area significantly hardens the risk and makes it tougher to overcome. Options to help women stay HIV negative have been limited. However, this obstacle shifted several years ago with FDA approval and CDC endorsement of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Yet, the majority of U.S. women do not know that PrEP can be a female-controlled strategy or that it applies to them—and backup has not been forthcoming from providers or their communities. What is most disturbing, however, is the absence of PrEP as an accessible strategy among women of color in high impact regions of the country. This developmental U34 responds to RFA-AA-17-013, which prioritizes community based participatory research (CBPR) to develop implementation models for women that address alcohol and HIV in high impact regions and communities. The proposed study will produce an evidence- and CBPR-driven PrEP implementation intervention to enhance uptake and optimize use among women of color in South Florida, which is currently the highest impact region of the U.S. with HIV rates recently determined by the CDC to be the highest in the nation. The study builds upon the team’s experience in alcohol/HIV intervention and CBPR in South Florida and preliminary work with stakeholders from the greater Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas to develop a multi- level PrEP intervention program for African American, Latina, and Haitian women who engage in risky sex and AOD use. The study includes researchers from the Southern HIV and Alcohol Research Consortium (SHARC) and will inform the design of target and comparison groups and other features of a U01 for further study within the NIAAA CHAART Consortia. Guided by the social ecological framework, the study will: identify needs, priorities, and community strengths and develop a PrEP continuum during a summit to engage stakeholders (Aim 1); produce a replicable implementation program, including manuals, materials, instruments, and procedures, through the formation of a Community Advisory and Advocacy Board (Aim 2); and conduct an exploratory pilot among 120 multi-ethnic women of color in Broward and Miami-Dade counties to test fidelity, feasibility and acceptability and measure PrEP uptake and adherence and retention in care over a 6 month period. The study will utilize biomarkers in a subsample to compare with self-reports and pharmacy refill measures. It will be among the first to develop a PrEP intervention in the South for women of color, and is thus in line with the specific high funding priorities of the Office of AIDS Research on cross-cutting research to reduce health disparities in developing implementation approaches for bio-behavioral strategies such as PrEP. Public Health Relevance Despite FDA approval in 2012, followed by recommendations from the CDC and WHO, the majority of women in the U.S. are not aware of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as an HIV prevention strategy that applies to them. The purpose of this study is to use a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) model to develop and preliminarily test an intervention program that will optimize oral PrEP utilization among women of color in South Florida, the region with the highest HIV rates in the U.S. The intervention will evaluate fidelity, feasibility and acceptability, determine patterns of PrEP uptake and adherence and retention in care, and explore the known correlates of risk such as AOD use.",Optimizing PrEP Utilization among Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Using Women of Color,9552689,U34AA026219,"['Acquired

"Characterizing PrEP Adherence and Patterns of Use in a Diverse Community Cohort of Young Men Project Summary Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) are at high risk for HIV–particularly YMSM of color. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is extremely effective at reducing HIV transmission. Uptake has been lower than anticipated, but is increasing rapidly–though less so among Black YMSM. PrEP effectiveness hinges upon adherence, but levels of adherence vary and tend to be lower among Black individuals and youth. Adherence to daily PrEP does not need to be perfect to obtain benefit–in the iPrEx open-label extension, taking 2-3 doses/week was 84% efficacious (4+ was 100% efficacious)–and non-daily dosing strategies are also under investigation (event- and time-driven dosing). Beyond adherence, patterns of use are critically important. Oral PrEP is unlikely to be a life-long strategy for most, and evidence suggests that many YMSM discontinue PrEP (particularly Black and Latino YMSM), but most discontinuers report continued HIV risk behaviors. Further, studies are beginning to examine episodic PrEP use during discrete periods of highest HIV risk. Finally, risk compensation (i.e., decreased condom use after initiating PrEP) is a crucial component of PrEP effectiveness as it may maintain, or even increase, HIV transmission if adherence is not optimal. The goal of the current proposal is to characterize PrEP adherence across dosing strategies, describe patterns of use (continuous, episodic, discontinuation), and examine racial differences in adherence and patterns of use. We will embed novel mixed-methods research into RADAR, a diverse cohort of YMSM (N>1,200; age 16-29) assessed every 6 months (U01DA036939). We propose to add a daily diary study of PrEP users to characterize adherence and patterns of use, biomarkers of adherence to objectively measure PrEP coverage, and in-depth interviews with PrEP users to understand contextual influences on these issues. Aim 1: Describe PrEP adherence, dosing strategies, and usage patterns among YMSM. We will conduct a 3-month daily diary study with 120 YMSM PrEP users from RADAR to: a) characterize patterns of PrEP dosing strategies (daily, time-driven, event- driven), adherence, and usage patterns (continuous, episodic, discontinuation); b) Examine whether PrEP adherence or dosing strategies are associated with self-reported sexual risk behavior and STI infection; and c) describe racial differences in PrEP adherence, dosing strategies, and risk compensation. Aim 2: Assess associations between usage patterns and long- and short-term concentrations of PrEP in red blood cells. We will collect dried blood spot samples once per month during the diary study (3x) to assess concentrations of tenofovir-diphosphate and embtricitabine-triphosphate. Aim 3: Characterize YMSM perspectives on adherence, usage patterns, and risk compensation. We will conduct in-depth interviews with 60 YMSM diary study participants to understand individual, interpersonal, and structural influences on PrEP adherence and patterns of use, with an emphasis on understanding racial differences. Data from this study will inform the development of public health messaging and behavioral interventions to improve PrEP effectiveness among diverse YMSM. Project Narrative Young men who have sex with men (YMSM), particularly YMSM of color, are at high risk for HIV infection. Pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective at reducing HIV transmission but is reliant on optimal adherence and sustained use during periods of high risk. This proposal aims to characterize PrEP adherence and patterns of use in a diverse community cohort of YMSM by integrating a 3-month daily diary study, biomarkers of adherence, and in-depth interviews with PrEP users into the larger cohort study.",Characterizing PrEP Adherence and Patterns of Use in a Diverse Community Cohort of Young Men,9667549,R01MD013609,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red blood corpuscule ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Erythrocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood normocyte ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Public Health ', ' Diphosphates ', ' Pyrophosphates ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' tripolyphosphate ', ' triphosphate ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' improved ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' Anal Sex ', ' Spottings ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' cohort ', ' condoms ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' trend ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' open label study ', ' open label ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' protective effect ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' young man ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,433491,0.32403117474900517
"Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program ""UA PREP"" Program Summary/Abstract American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) are the most underrepresented racial/ethnic group among scientists in the U.S. One reason for their low representation is the cultural difference between Indigenous and Euro-American-based science, which can lead to a feeling of isolation for AI/AN students. The vision of Indigenous1 scholars within higher education and the long-term goal of the proposed University of Arizona Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (UA PREP) is to overcome these differences and increase the participation of AI/AN students in biomedical research. Due to its close proximity to many Tribal or AI/AN communities, the richness of its biomedical and behavioral research enterprise, and an institutional-level commitment to diversity and inclusion, UA is well-positioned for a PREP program. Further, UA ranks first among U.S. research-intensive universities in conferring PhD degrees to AI/AN students. The premise of the proposed PREP is that nurturing overall well-being and honoring Indigenous science knowledge while offering AI/AN students a doctoral-level research experience will provide the best foundation for success in graduate school. The current proposal seeks to provide five to eight UA PREP participants per year with an intensive research experience and additional training to enhance their competitiveness for doctoral programs. Strategic partnerships with minority-serving institutions and with programs at UA that support AI/AN undergraduates in STEM fields will be utilized to support recruitment efforts. The program will focus on students who have encountered greater than average challenges on their path to graduate school. Participants will spend 75% of their time conducting hypothesis-driven, doctoral-level research. The proposed activities for the remaining 25% of the participants' efforts will provide career development training. The matriculation and retention of AI/AN students in graduate programs will be increased by nurturing a sense of belonging within the community of science while honoring Indigenous knowledge. We aim to have at least 75% of the trainees matriculate into biomedical PhD programs. Their retention and success in these programs will be enhanced by foundations laid in UA PREP. Participants will be encouraged to incorporate their cultural values into their individual development plans. Further, program activities will nurture community engagement with frequent opportunities to interact with Native and non-Native science faculty and graduate students. The capacity of UA to train AI/AN graduate students will be fostered through annual workshops aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of faculty in mentoring students and increasing cultural sensitivity and awareness of and integration of Indigenous science methods into the curriculum. A selection committee of research-active mentors will recommend the strongest applicants to UA PREP for approval by the Institutional Advisory Committee. This committee and an expert external evaluator will regularly assess progress towards the UA PREP program objectives. 1Indigenous and Native American are used here, respectively, for Indigenous groups internationally and in the U.S. 1 Project Narrative American Indians/Alaskan Natives (AI/AN) are the most underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities in the biomedical sciences. The University of Arizona Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (UA PREP) seeks to provide AI/AN students with a rigorous research and educational program that honors Indigenous perspectives and nurtures a strong sense of well-being and belonging. This program will enhance the confidence and success of participants and their matriculation into strong biomedical PhD programs and subsequently increase the diversity of PhD-level scientists.","Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program ""UA PREP""",9415224,R25GM121228,"['Affect ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Arizona ', ' Awareness ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Colorado ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Montana ', ' New Mexico ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Reflex action ', ' Reflex ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Trainers Training ', ' Vocation ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' role model ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Native Americans ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' System ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' graduate student ', ' cultural values ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' career development ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Indigenous ', ' International ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' NIGMS ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' minority institution ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Math ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' Evaluative Thinking ', ' Complex thinking ', ' Critical Thinking ', ' student-led learning ', ' student mentoring ', ' faculty research ', ' peer teaching ', ' peer mentoring ', ' peer led team learning ', ' peer instruction ', ' peer coaching ', ' higher education ', ' matriculation ', ' education research ', ' Cultural Sensitivity ', ' Student recruitment ', ' non-Native ', ' Diné ', ' Diné Nation ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R25,2018,237983,0.2805779903306428
"A Structural Approach to Improving HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Implementation among High Risk Men PROJECT SUMMARY  Dr. Raifman’s long-term career development goal is to become an independent researcher working to reduce sexual minority health disparities with a focus on reducing the burden of HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM). MSM in the United States have a lifetime risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) nearly 80 times that of men who have sex with women, but just 4% reported using pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV in 2014. Structural stigma based on sexual orientation may contribute to slow PrEP uptake. Dr. Raifman will evaluate the role of structural stigma in MSM PrEP awareness and uptake and will develop and refine a clinic-level intervention to reduce structural stigma and improve PrEP uptake. She has the following research aims: (1) Assess state-level structural stigma and PrEP awareness and uptake among MSM through a difference-in-differences analysis; (2) Assess the relationship between sexual minority stigma in healthcare settings and PrEP awareness and uptake, and whether stigma in healthcare setting mediates any relationship between state-level stigma and PrEP awareness and uptake; and (3) Develop and refine a PrEP and structural stigma intervention for primary care settings. Dr. Raifman will use Centers for Disease Control and Prevention repeated cross-sectional National HIV Behavioral Surveillance Data collected from MSM in 21 cities and national Internet survey data from MSM collected by Fenway Health in 2013. She will also conduct qualitative interviews with clinic administrators, primary care providers, and MSM patients in Massachusetts and Georgia, states with differing levels of disparities in MSM health.  The proposed research builds upon Dr. Raifman’s prior research on the health effects of structural stigma affecting sexual minorities, on HIV prevention and PrEP implementation, and on HIV treatment and care. She will pursue the following K01 training aims to prepare her for the proposed research and for her career goals: (1) Acquire training on health and social policymaking in the US; (2) Acquire high-level training in statistical methods for causal mediation analysis to evaluate different levels of stigma; (3) Acquire training on developing and evaluating multi-component, clinical interventions; and (4) Acquire training in health informatics in order to integrate interventions into electronic medical records. To achieve these training goals, Dr. Raifman has assembled a mentorship team lead by Dr. Michael Stein, the chair of Health Law, Policy, and Management at Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH); Dr. Kenneth Mayer, Medical Director of Fenway Health; Dr. Colleen Barry, the Julie and Fred Soper Professor and Chair of Health Policy and Management at Johns Hopkins; and Dr. Debbie Cheng, BUSPH Professor of Biostatistics. Dr. Raifman’s training will prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator reducing the disproportionate burden of HIV and other health disparities among sexual minorities.

"Improving Prevention Systems to Reduce Disparities for High Priority Populations. 7. PROJECT SUMMARY This project collaborates with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) to develop and test a field-based comprehensive sexual health intervention for HIV-exposed contacts notified by its Partner Services (i.e., HIV contact tracing) program. Individuals reached by PS programs are highest priority for linkage to HIV prevention/care services: 10-20% are newly diagnosed with HIV as a result of PS notification and the remainder are eligible and high priority for PrEP. Because they seek out highest-risk individuals in the field, PS programs have the potential to significantly reduce existing disparities in PrEP uptake and timely HIV care initiation by reaching populations that are currently under-engaged by traditional PrEP or HIV testing programs. The new Partner Services-Sexual Health (PS-SH) intervention offers a comprehensive sexual health package that includes HIV testing, STI testing, ARV/PrEP education and immediate medication start to all individuals receiving contact notification (i.e., being notified of a recent exposure to HIV). NYCDOHMH is collaborating on this research project to enable a scientifically rigorous test of the intervention’s efficacy and produce the highest quality data on implementation dynamics, cost-effectiveness, and affordability to inform dissemination and adaptation of the intervention, should it prove effective. The specific aims are to: (1) Pilot and refine a field-based comprehensive sexual health intervention delivered through the NYC DOHMH Partner Services Program. Under this aim, we will pilot the intervention in five highest prevalence NYC neighborhoods for 6-months (n = ~60), examine feasibility and acceptability, and refine the intervention process and protocols for the trial to test effectiveness at scale. (2) Examine the effectiveness of the Partner Services-Sexual Health (PS-SH) intervention in improving rates of HIV testing, linkage to HIV prevention/care, and PrEP uptake among highest risk contacts recently exposed to HIV. Under this aim, we will conduct a cross-sectional stepped wedge cluster randomized trial in which 12 clusters of NYC neighborhoods are exposed to the intervention sequentially, with three clusters moving from control to intervention every 6 months (n = 1150). Primary outcomes are HIV testing, timely PrEP/ARV uptake, and linkage to PrEP/HIV care. Secondary outcomes are STD testing and receipt of STD treatment (if indicated). (3) Conduct preliminary analyses of economic outcomes, including cost-allocation and affordability to allow other jurisdictions to make decisions about implementation. These analyses will include per-outcome cost-estimates, and will develop a blueprint for economic evaluation of the intervention including incremental cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses for application locally and nationally. The proposed project is poised to have a significant and sustained impact on the field by: a) addressing a critical gap in the prevention/care continuum to reduce persistent disparities in the epidemic; and b) pioneering a collaborative implementation science approach to accelerate the dissemination of evidence-based practice models across the United States and internationally. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe disparities in PrEP access and uptake remain among populations most strongly impacted by the HIV epidemic. These same populations suffer from disproportionately high rates of undiagnosed infection and late treatment initiation that translate into high levels of HIV-related mobility and mortality.

"Mapping perceptions of PrEP use in transwomen and barriers to care in providers to inform intervention development Project Summary Transgender women are at significantly higher risk of contracting HIV, yet analysis of the iPrEx study indicates use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) had no effectiveness in preventing HIV in this group on an intention-to- treat basis. While significantly understudied, qualitative work suggests that trans women experience unique, trans-specific issues, including prioritization of hormone therapy and transition-related medical care over HIV prevention, and real and perceived trans-related stigma and discrimination in healthcare settings. The result is a significant group who is highly vulnerable to HIV infection and its negative health consequences, yet is less likely to benefit from PrEP. Research is urgently needed to understand how trans women perceive their HIV risk and make decisions about PrEP, as well as how healthcare providers address stigma and structural barriers to treatment, so that appropriate interventions can be developed. Utilizing perceptual mapping and vector modeling techniques, we will conduct a mixed methods study in San Francisco and Philadelphia combining in-depth qualitative methods with quantitative surveys to assess trans women's perceptions of PrEP, and get feedback on stigma and structural barriers to accessing healthcare from providers. Using vector message modeling, these maps will be used to identify specific message strategies to be embedded into larger interventions to address trans women's PrEP barriers and providers' barriers to treating trans women. Specific aims of the research are: 1: To create perceptual mapping survey instruments for trans women and healthcare providers to assess perceptions of PrEP, trans-related stigma, and barriers to healthcare. To accomplish this we will conduct focus groups (n=60) and interviews with healthcare providers (n=10) serving trans women and then develop perceptual mapping surveys based on findings; 2. To develop highly targeted messages to enhance PrEP decision-making in trans women and address structural barriers and beliefs in providers using perceptual mapping and vector modeling. To accomplish this aim we will conduct perceptual mapping surveys with trans women (n=100) and healthcare providers (n=50) and perform perceptual mapping and vector message modeling analysis to develop messages; 3. To assess the messages for cultural salience and get insight into acceptable communication channels and intervention activities to enhance decision making around PrEP use in HIV-negative trans women and address stigmatizing beliefs and structural barriers in providers. We will accomplish this by conducting focus groups with trans women (n=40) and interviews with providers (n=10) to get feedback on how messages would be best delivered in an intervention and analyze data to identify the most effective messages and delivery strategies. We expect our innovative methods will have wide application for designing effective, tailored messages to address barriers to PrEP and concerns about structural barriers to receiving healthcare, an important strategy for eliminating health disparities among an at- risk trans women. Project Narrative The proposed study will significantly contribute to the field of HIV prevention by providing insight into the specific perceptions of trans women and healthcare providers, which have application for development of interventions that address trans-specific barriers to PrEP uptake and adherence. Using perceptual mapping, an innovative marketing evaluation technique, we will identify trans women's perceptions and incorporate strategies for navigating structural barriers and stigma by getting insights from their healthcare providers. Tailored messages will then be presented for feedback on culturally relevant intervention strategies.",Mapping perceptions of PrEP use in transwomen and barriers to care in providers to inform intervention development,9470910,R21MH110340,"['Affect ', ' planetary Atmosphere ', ' earth atmosphere ', ' Atmosphere ', ' Belief ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Decision Making ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Interview ', ' Maps ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Prostitution ', ' survival sex ', ' commercial sex work ', ' commercial sex ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' uptake ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' hormone therapy ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Techniques ', ' 3-Dimensional ', ' 3-D ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' vector ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' scale up ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' tailored messaging ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' transgender women ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to care ', ' provider barriers ', ' provider-level barriers ', ' ']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R21,2018,235923,0.23333554536480544
"Offering women PrEP with education, shared decision-making and trauma-informed care: the OPENS trial PROJECT SUMMARY  Although 13% of the U.S. female population is Black, 60% of new HIV diagnoses in U.S. women are in Black women. The South is the epicenter of the U.S. HIV epidemic, including in women, and Black Southern women are disproportionately affected: Black women account for 69% of new HIV diagnoses in women in the South. As the first highly effective, discrete, woman-controlled HIV prevention method, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine radically expands HIV prevention options for women. However, uptake of PrEP in U.S. women has lagged, particularly among groups most affected by HIV. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates 468,000 women in the U.S. are eligible for PrEP, but only approximately 19,000 have ever been prescribed PrEP. Moreover, despite disparities in incident HIV in U.S. women, White women are 4 times more likely to have received PrEP than Black women.  PrEP cascades outline the necessary steps for accessing PrEP, including screening and identifying eligible individuals, linkage to care, prescription and initiation of PrEP. Data suggest there are multilevel barriers related to the process of screening for HIV risk in women and identifying potential PrEP candidates that may drive a significant drop off early in the PrEP cascade for women. The objective of this proposal is to improve mechanisms of offering PrEP to women through use of a patient-level intervention—an HIV prevention decision support tool (DST); a provider-level intervention—training on shared decision-making; and a clinic-level intervention--training on trauma-informed care, with the goal of ultimately mitigating disparities in the HIV epidemic in women by increasing PrEP uptake in Southern U.S. women of color.  This study will occur at 2 reproductive health clinics in Duval County, Florida, were HIV incidence in women is high. In Aim 1, participants will be randomized to an HIV prevention DST coupled with standard counseling or standard counseling alone to evaluate the effect of the DST on PrEP prescriptions as well as patient experiences of PrEP care and counseling. In Aim 2, a 3-phase approach will be used to evaluate how provider training on shared decision making and clinic-wide training on trauma-informed care affect patient counseling and decision making about PrEP. Baseline data collected in Phase 1 will be compared to data collected after the trainings without use of the DST (Phase 2), and to data collected after the trainings with use of the DST (Phase 3). Data collection in each 3-month phase will include chart extraction on PrEP prescriptions, exit surveys with women about HIV prevention choices and quality of counseling, audio-taped counseling sessions, and interviews with women of color to explore experiences of HIV prevention counseling and care. In the final aim, the feasibility of disseminating the multilevel interventions described in Aims 1&2 will be assessed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, providing preliminary data on implementation. Narrative There are striking racial and regional disparities in HIV diagnoses in women in the U.S., as well as in utilization of effective HIV prevention methods such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention. Reasons for these disparities are multifactorial, and require multi-level interventions to address them. The objective of this study is to improve mechanisms of identifying women vulnerable to HIV in the Southern U.S. and offer them comprehensive HIV prevention methods, including PrEP, through use of a patient-level intervention—offering universal education about PrEP via an HIV prevention decision support tool--a provider-level intervention— training on shared decision-making—and a clinic-level intervention--training on trauma-informed care— ultimately mitigating disparities in the HIV epidemic in women by increasing PrEP uptake in Southern U.S. women of color.","Offering women PrEP with education, shared decision-making and trauma-informed care: the OPENS trial",9658384,R01MD013565,"['Affect ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Color ', ' Family Planning ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' Florida ', ' Fumarates ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Privatization ', ' Qualitative Evaluations ', ' Quantitative Evaluations ', ' Risk ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' uptake ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' Reporting ', ' Contraceptive methods ', ' Inhibition of Fertilization ', ' Fertility Control ', ' Contraception ', ' HIV risk ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' emtricitabine ', "" beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine "", ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' implementation research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' Coupled ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' primary outcome ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' support tools ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' provider barriers ', ' provider-level barriers ', ' system-level barriers ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2018,530692,0.32942067971199324
"Reducing Intersectional Stigma among High-Risk Women in Brazil to Promote Uptake of HIV Testing and PrEP PROJECT SUMMARY Globally, transgender (`trans') women experience extreme social and economic marginalization due to intersectional stigma, defined as the confluence of stigma that results from the intersection of social identities and positions among those who are multiply oppressed. Among trans women, gender-based stigma intersects with social positions such as engagement in sex work and substance use, as well as race-based stigma to generate a social context of vulnerability and increased risk of HIV acquisition. In Brazil, trans women are the `most-at-risk' group for HIV, with 55 times higher estimated odds of HIV infection than the general population; further, uptake of HIV testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among trans women is significantly lower than other at-risk groups, despite availability in the public sector and documented interest in the community. Through extensive formative work, we have developed a multi-level intervention utilizing HIV prevention strategies which have demonstrated feasibility and acceptability by trans women in Brazil, to address intersectional stigma and increase engagement of trans women in the HIV prevention continuum. We propose to test `Guerreiras' (`warrior women', as named by trans women participants in Brazil), comprised of two intervention components designed to address intersectional stigma: 1) a group-level, peer-led intervention and 2) an individual-level peer navigation program to increase uptake of HIV testing and PrEP. Guerreiras is informed by a trans-specific conceptual model, gender affirmation theory, that describes intersectional stigma faced by trans women, informs investigations of how intersectional stigma results in health disparities, and provides a framework for intervention development and testing. We will recruit trans women (N=400) from clinical sites, outreach events, and an observational cohort in São Paulo, Brazil. Guerreiras will be evaluated using a randomized wait-list controlled trial to compare HIV testing uptake (self-testing and clinic-based) (Aim 1), PrEP initiation and persistence (Aim 2), and other prevention services (e.g. harm reduction) among trans women in the intervention arm compared to those in the control arm with data collection scheduled every three months. We will assess changes in intersectional stigma (Aim 3), including reductions in internalized stigma and increased resilience to anticipated and enacted stigma, among those assigned to intervention compared to those assigned to control, and assess how changes in stigma domains result in prevention uptake. Outcomes will be monitored through the national medications dispensing system (PrEP initiation and persistence), clinical records and self-report (HIV testing), and through comprehensive surveys (intersectional stigma). The proposed research leverages a productive multi-disciplinary HIV research partnership with extensive experience working with trans women in Brazil, multi-level intervention components, and a context where PrEP and HIVST are available publicly, providing an opportunity to evaluate and scale-up an HIV prevention initiative in a key health disparity population, while contributing to nascent research in intersectional stigma. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed trial is grounded in a novel transgender-specific conceptual framework and is the culmination of decades of research in a population at high risk for HIV acquisition. Together, our investigative team has developed and piloted multiple, complementary intervention components to address intersectional stigma and increase engagement in the HIV prevention continuum among trans women in São Paulo, Brazil. The proposed intervention approach has the potential to optimize health outcomes in a population where intersectional stigma results in extreme health disparities and few proven effective interventions exist to date.",Reducing Intersectional Stigma among High-Risk Women in Brazil to Promote Uptake of HIV Testing and PrEP,9853527,R01MH121308,"['Brazil ', ' Communities ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Data Collection ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Names ', ' Public Sector ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Identity ', ' Social Identification ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' waitlist ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Schedule ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', ' uptake ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' condoms ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' prevention service ', ' peer ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' outreach ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Prevention ', ' Social status ', ' social standing ', ' social position ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' post intervention ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' arm ', ' transgender women ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' intersectionality ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' recruit ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,668917,0.11773825758352689
"Optimizing an IMB-guided intervention to support HIV self-testing and PrEP uptake among YMSM: A pilot factorial RCT PROJECT SUMMARY Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV, and more than 70% of HIV infections among youth (≤ 24 years old) occur among young MSM (YMSM). US Food and Drug Administration approved oral fluid rapid HIV self-testing (HIVST) devices provide a critical route for reducing barriers to HIV testing; however, uptake of HIVST among YMSM has been slow to date and no known studies have explored barriers and facilitators to HIVST among YMSM using rigorous mixed-methods procedures. YMSM who engage in HIVST are also good candidates for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), but PrEP uptake among YMSM has been minimal to date. The Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model is an empirically supported framework for HIV prevention, which can be applied to the barriers and facilitators related to HIVST and PrEP uptake. An IMB-guided mHealth intervention is a promising strategy to increase HIVST and PrEP uptake, offering participant confidentiality and potential scaling of an efficient intervention. Despite the promise of this type of theoretically-guided intervention, little is known about the independent effects of each IMB model construct on HIVST and PrEP uptake. To support intervention development, we will conduct mixed-methods formative research to explore IMB-related barriers and facilitators to HIVST and PrEP uptake among YMSM using data collected via online focus groups (n = 12; 96-144 individuals) with YMSM nationwide and a national survey of YMSM (n = 500; i.e., Aim 1). We will then pilot an IMB-factorial mHealth intervention to increase HIVST and post-test PrEP uptake tailored for YMSM, assessing feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact at 3-month follow-up (i.e., Aim 2). The intervention will be reviewed by an online youth advisory board and beta-tested with 12 YMSM. We will then pilot the clinical trial with 120 YMSM randomized to one of four groups using a factorial randomized experimental design, allowing us to determine which IMB model construct(s) are most important to increase HIVST and PrEP uptake. The four arms of this randomized controlled trial will be information-only (I), information + motivation (IM), information + behavioral skills (IB), and full IMB model (IMB). Dried blood spot sampling will be used to measure PrEP uptake and adherence. The training plan of this K01 award is designed to facilitate Dr. Steven A. John's transition to an independent investigator. Specifically, Dr. John will: (1) develop skills in mixed-methods research including advanced training in qualitative research methods, (2) build content expertise in mHealth interventions for HIV prevention, and (3) gain expertise in translating formative work into efficacy trials with supplemental training in quantitative analysis and implementation science. Additional training in responsible and ethical conduct in research and a focus on career enhancement and professional development will accompany the three primary training goals. The training plan includes didactic coursework, independent study, training institutes, academic conferences, manuscript preparation, grant writing, and other research activities.

"Accelerating PrEP Diffusion through Network Change Agents ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early evidence exists of disparities in Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) knowledge, PrEP seeking behavior and PrEP adoption based on race. Black communities and in particular, younger Black MSM (YBMSM) have limited PrEP engagement. Evidence of few Black PrEP users is of concern with <15% of PrEP clients in Washington DC and New York City identifying as Black in PrEP demonstration/implementation projects. This finding is in the context of YBMSM leading new infections in these cities (and nationally). Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of PrEP clients nationally are privately insured and older - two characteristics incongruous with current HIV incidence. So while PrEP is promising; real-world PrEP use faces major implementation challenges.  Over the past two decades, the most widely used network-based intervention for HIV prevention has been the opinion leader (OL) model or variants of it. This approach includes training popular members from a target population to promote HIV prevention messages through interpersonal communication. The effectiveness of the OL model can be limited by several factors, including: heterogeneous and overlapping networks, inadequate network assessments, and the OL's public position which often requires she/he maintain conformity to the status quo. Consequently, identifying those who connect across groups of otherwise disconnected individuals (hereafter ""network bridges""), may be an alternative and efficient way to use network information to accelerate behavior change as has been demonstrated in other settings.  This proposal moves beyond traditional OL and peer outreach models by aiming to recruit change agents based upon their structural position in a social network, in this case Facebook, in order to accelerate diffusion of PrEP. This framework is further important for measuring the potential of bridging network members as they may be the earliest innovation adopters and are likely to be more willing to challenge the existing status quo. Such bridges have structural advantages that have led to increased communication, innovation and efficiency in workplace settings; however, such bridging impact in public health contexts is understudied.  We propose to address these knowledge gaps and intervene by building upon two recent studies through three phases. Phase I expands the use of Facebook for accurately characterizing a YBMSM network using a hybrid network data collection approach developed and implemented by the PI. Phase II identifies, recruits and trains change agents based upon their structural position (e.g., bridging, central, or other positions). Phase III measures and evaluates three stages of PrEP diffusion as promoted by the same agents. Our interdisciplinary team has expertise with PrEP implementation (Schneider), bridging metrics (Valente), intervention training (Bouris, Hill), social network analysis (Schneider, Valente, Goodreau), ethics (Karnik) and diffusion (Valente, Khanna). The proposed research will advance current understandings of diffusion of PrEP innovation and if successful, is structured to impact urban HIV epicenters with alarming rates of HIV infection in YBMSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed intervention will utilize bridging network members within a large young Black MSM Facebook network to accelerate the diffusion of PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) knowledge and early adoption in this same network. If successful, this project has the potential to translate a highly efficacious biomedical intervention into an impactful one in a sub-population at highest risk for HIV infection in the United States.",Accelerating PrEP Diffusion through Network Change Agents,9637228,R01AI120700,"['Adoption ', ' Behavior ', ' Chicago ', ' Cities ', ' Client ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diffusion ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"A Structural Approach to Improving HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Implementation among High Risk Men PROJECT SUMMARY  Dr. Raifman’s long-term career development goal is to become an independent researcher working to reduce sexual minority health disparities with a focus on reducing the burden of HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM). MSM in the United States have a lifetime risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) nearly 80 times that of men who have sex with women, but just 4% reported using pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV in 2014. Structural stigma based on sexual orientation may contribute to slow PrEP uptake. Dr. Raifman will evaluate the role of structural stigma in MSM PrEP awareness and uptake and will develop and refine a clinic-level intervention to reduce structural stigma and improve PrEP uptake. She has the following research aims: (1) Assess state-level structural stigma and PrEP awareness and uptake among MSM through a difference-in-differences analysis; (2) Assess the relationship between sexual minority stigma in healthcare settings and PrEP awareness and uptake, and whether stigma in healthcare setting mediates any relationship between state-level stigma and PrEP awareness and uptake; and (3) Develop and refine a PrEP and structural stigma intervention for primary care settings. Dr. Raifman will use Centers for Disease Control and Prevention repeated cross-sectional National HIV Behavioral Surveillance Data collected from MSM in 21 cities and national Internet survey data from MSM collected by Fenway Health in 2013. She will also conduct qualitative interviews with clinic administrators, primary care providers, and MSM patients in Massachusetts and Georgia, states with differing levels of disparities in MSM health.  The proposed research builds upon Dr. Raifman’s prior research on the health effects of structural stigma affecting sexual minorities, on HIV prevention and PrEP implementation, and on HIV treatment and care. She will pursue the following K01 training aims to prepare her for the proposed research and for her career goals: (1) Acquire training on health and social policymaking in the US; (2) Acquire high-level training in statistical methods for causal mediation analysis to evaluate different levels of stigma; (3) Acquire training on developing and evaluating multi-component, clinical interventions; and (4) Acquire training in health informatics in order to integrate interventions into electronic medical records. To achieve these training goals, Dr. Raifman has assembled a mentorship team lead by Dr. Michael Stein, the chair of Health Law, Policy, and Management at Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH); Dr. Kenneth Mayer, Medical Director of Fenway Health; Dr. Colleen Barry, the Julie and Fred Soper Professor and Chair of Health Policy and Management at Johns Hopkins; and Dr. Debbie Cheng, BUSPH Professor of Biostatistics.

"Characterizing PrEP Adherence and Patterns of Use in a Diverse Community Cohort of Young Men Project Summary Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) are at high risk for HIV–particularly YMSM of color. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is extremely effective at reducing HIV transmission. Uptake has been lower than anticipated, but is increasing rapidly–though less so among Black YMSM. PrEP effectiveness hinges upon adherence, but levels of adherence vary and tend to be lower among Black individuals and youth. Adherence to daily PrEP does not need to be perfect to obtain benefit–in the iPrEx open-label extension, taking 2-3 doses/week was 84% efficacious (4+ was 100% efficacious)–and non-daily dosing strategies are also under investigation (event- and time-driven dosing). Beyond adherence, patterns of use are critically important. Oral PrEP is unlikely to be a life-long strategy for most, and evidence suggests that many YMSM discontinue PrEP (particularly Black and Latino YMSM), but most discontinuers report continued HIV risk behaviors. Further, studies are beginning to examine episodic PrEP use during discrete periods of highest HIV risk. Finally, risk compensation (i.e., decreased condom use after initiating PrEP) is a crucial component of PrEP effectiveness as it may maintain, or even increase, HIV transmission if adherence is not optimal. The goal of the current proposal is to characterize PrEP adherence across dosing strategies, describe patterns of use (continuous, episodic, discontinuation), and examine racial differences in adherence and patterns of use. We will embed novel mixed-methods research into RADAR, a diverse cohort of YMSM (N>1,200; age 16-29) assessed every 6 months (U01DA036939). We propose to add a daily diary study of PrEP users to characterize adherence and patterns of use, biomarkers of adherence to objectively measure PrEP coverage, and in-depth interviews with PrEP users to understand contextual influences on these issues. Aim 1: Describe PrEP adherence, dosing strategies, and usage patterns among YMSM. We will conduct a 3-month daily diary study with 120 YMSM PrEP users from RADAR to: a) characterize patterns of PrEP dosing strategies (daily, time-driven, event- driven), adherence, and usage patterns (continuous, episodic, discontinuation); b) Examine whether PrEP adherence or dosing strategies are associated with self-reported sexual risk behavior and STI infection; and c) describe racial differences in PrEP adherence, dosing strategies, and risk compensation. Aim 2: Assess associations between usage patterns and long- and short-term concentrations of PrEP in red blood cells. We will collect dried blood spot samples once per month during the diary study (3x) to assess concentrations of tenofovir-diphosphate and embtricitabine-triphosphate. Aim 3: Characterize YMSM perspectives on adherence, usage patterns, and risk compensation. We will conduct in-depth interviews with 60 YMSM diary study participants to understand individual, interpersonal, and structural influences on PrEP adherence and patterns of use, with an emphasis on understanding racial differences. Data from this study will inform the development of public health messaging and behavioral interventions to improve PrEP effectiveness among diverse YMSM. Project Narrative Young men who have sex with men (YMSM), particularly YMSM of color, are at high risk for HIV infection. Pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective at reducing HIV transmission but is reliant on optimal adherence and sustained use during periods of high risk. This proposal aims to characterize PrEP adherence and patterns of use in a diverse community cohort of YMSM by integrating a 3-month daily diary study, biomarkers of adherence, and in-depth interviews with PrEP users into the larger cohort study.",Characterizing PrEP Adherence and Patterns of Use in a Diverse Community Cohort of Young Men,9772557,R01MD013609,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Red Cell ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Public Health ', ' Pyrophosphates ', ' Diphosphates ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' triphosphate ', ' tripolyphosphate ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' improved ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' uptake ', ' Anal Sex ', ' Spottings ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' cohort ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' trend ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' open label ', ' open label study ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' protective effect ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' recruit ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk behavior ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,509553,0.32403117474900517
"Evaluating the Feasibility and Acceptability of ""PrEP-Talk"": A PrEP Uptake Intervention for Young Black MSM with their Close Friends Summary  Young Black MSM (YBMSM) are at critically high and disproportionate HIV risk. Reducing HIV incidence rates among YBMSM will likely require increased adoption of additional strategies such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP is a FDA approved medication for HIV that also prevents HIV transmission when taken appropriately. Interventions are needed to address potential individual, social/cultural, and structural barriers to uptake and adherence of PrEP among YBMSM to help curb HIV infections. Our preliminary research suggests that some YBMSM feel concerned that PrEP is not effective or may be toxic, about being stigmatized for having HIV if they take PrEP, as well as concerns about access and side effects. Therefore, we propose “PrEP-Talk”, an intervention that will use a PrEP Counselor (PC) who can provide information and guidance to YBMSM with the inclusion of a close friend (CF) to support PrEP uptake and adherence. In order to address these critical and timely issues, we developed the following specific aims:  1. To develop and manualize “PrEP-Talk,” which aims to increase PrEP uptake and  adherence among YBMSM. This will be done through qualitative formative research (3  focus groups with 12-18 YBMSM and CF dyads, N=24-36); partnering with a community  advisory board (comprised of individuals knowledgeable about HIV work with YBMSM);  and field tests of the intervention with 5 YBMSM and CF dyads (N=10).  2. Examine feasibility, acceptability and indicators of preliminary efficacy of “PrEP-  Talk” on PrEP uptake and adherence among YBMSM. This will be accomplished  through a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 30 dyads (YBMSM and CFs) in the  intervention and 30 dyads in the control (N=120). We will conduct assessments at  baseline, 3-months and 6-months post-baseline. We will also assess PrEP uptake  supportive communication at each intervention session and collect urine samples to  measure a biomarker of PrEP uptake (initial adherence) from all YBMSM who report use  of PrEP. This proposed study is significant because our intervention may increase PrEP uptake and adherence, which may help to reduce HIV incidence among YBMSM. If the proposed intervention shows promise, we will prepare to undertake a full-scale R01-funded RCT. Statement of Public Health Relevance Young Black MSM (YBMSM) are at critically high risk for HIV infection. Reducing HIV rates among YBMSM will likely require increased adoption of biomedical HIV prevention strategies such as PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis---a medication that prevents HIV transmission), since other strategies (such as condom use promotion and HIV testing) have not been sufficient. Interventions to address barriers to PrEP uptake, such as our proposed PrEP-Talk, are urgently needed in order for PrEP to effectively lower HIV rates in this population, and address this critical public health disparity.","Evaluating the Feasibility and Acceptability of ""PrEP-Talk"": A PrEP Uptake Intervention for Young Black MSM with their Close Friends",9781039,R34MH118122,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' literacy ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' tool ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' pill ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' therapy adherence ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' trend ', ' sex ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' willingness ', ' Population ', ' peer influence ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' FDA approved ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' arm ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA STATE UNIV-DOMINGUEZ HILLS,R34,2019,238422,0.36325347002841357
"Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) PROJECT SUMMARY The long term goal of Mount Sinai's Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (Mount Sinai PREP) is to make a significant contribution to increasing the number of biomedical scientists from underrepresented minority groups, socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds or those who are challenged by a disability. We aim to prepare recent college graduates from these groups to enroll and succeed in competitive PhD and MD/PhD programs, and then complete postdoctoral or residency/fellowship training before entering careers in which they can contribute to biomedical research, drug development, or research on health and health care disparities. Now in its 17th year, Mount Sinai PREP alumni have garnered 24 PhD degrees, while completion of 4 more PhD degrees is also expected by the summer. During their predoctoral work, 24 Mount Sinai PREP alumni were supported by traineeships on T32 training grants, 10 were awarded F31 fellowships and many other prestigious fellowships were obtained, e.g. 3 UNCF/Merck awards. All the PREP alumni who completed PhD programs to date have entered postdoctoral work: 19 in academic settings, with prestigious fellowships including the CDC Infectious Disease Fellowship and HHMI Life Sciences Award; 1 at NIAID, with an IRTA award; 1 at the FDA with an FDA Commissioner's award; and 1 who pursued postdoctoral work at GlaxoSmithKline. Enhanced recruitment efforts, program evaluation (self-evaluation and external evaluation) and ongoing program development have enabled the program to achieve and benefit from a large applicant pool and maintain an accept/enter ratio between 1 and 1.2. Central strategies of Mount Sinai PREP include the following. We strive to ensure that each PREP scholar has a laboratory placement with an excellent faculty research mentor, supportive peer mentors, and an opportunity to work on a cutting-edge project of interest that develops analytical, conceptual and technical skills. We expect PREP scholars to integrate into laboratory activities such as lab meetings, journal clubs, and parties. They are also expected to integrate into the PREP community and activities such as workshops that build research, presentation, writing skills, or initiate a discussion of psychosocial well-being. PREP activities also include peer-led WIPs/Journal Clubs, lunches with advisors and guests with interesting paths to share, and encounters with PREP alumni. We further promote their integration into activities of the PhD, MD/PhD and master's student community of the Graduate School, which whom PREP scholars interact in courses, seminars, and both outreach and social activities. The Program joins a Regional PREP Symposium, at which the PREP scholars present their work and network. The Program will also follow up on a well-received 10 year Reunion/Retreat with a similar event every 5 years. The Program maintains close touch with PREP alumni through emails, reunions, and alumni visits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mount Sinai PREP seeks to increase the participation of individuals from underrepresented minority groups and socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals at the cutting-edge levels of biomedical research, and seeks to accommodate individuals with disabilities. Research shows that diverse groups function more effectively and innovatively than groups lacking diversity.

"mHealth Peer Support to Reduce Rates of STIs in Black MSM PrEP Users PROEJECT SUMMARY Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with emtricitibine/tenofovir disoproxyl fumarate (FTC/TDF) has been shown to dramatically reduce transmission of HIV in men who have sex with men (MSM). However, as an antiretroviral medication, it does not protect against other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Currently in the US, STI rates are at an “unprecedented high,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These elevated rates are especially pronounced in MSM prescribed PrEP and represent a crucial public health problem that requires immediate attention. Dr. Clement's K23 proposal will focus on addressing this problem through the use of mobile health (mHealth) technology in a critically important population with profound health disparities, Black MSM in the South. First, to understand predictors of STIs, she will explore the relationship between social factors (e.g. social isolation) and STI incidence; these relationships will inform research efforts to focus on those at highest risk for STIs. Second, she will investigate facilitators and barriers to STI risk reduction practices through in-depth interviews (IDIs) with Black MSM PrEP users. She will specifically inquire about peer support as a facilitator to STI risk reduction practices, and gather initial feedback on the peer support features of the mSMART application (“app”). Data will be used to adapt the app, which will be further assessed in focus groups. These qualitative studies will give valuable insight into factors driving sexual risk taking that the mSMART app will then target. Third, in a pilot investigation of Black MSM PrEP users with predictive STI risk factors, as identified in the first aim, she will conduct a randomized study to determine the feasibility and preliminary impact of the adapted mSMART app in reducing STI incidence. Through this proposal, Dr. Clement will build upon her experience in STIs with continued pursuit of critical public health research, and as a result be prepared to become a national leader in the field of HIV/STI prevention. Didactic coursework will bolster Dr. Clement's quantitative analytic skills and solidify her knowledge base. Additionally, she will gain training and experience in mHealth technology, a growing field with broad applications for health care access and delivery. She will also gain an appreciation for the application of qualitative science that will serve fruitful in future investigations. The mentorship team, led by Dr. Susanna Naggie, an experienced HIV investigator, will include experts in behavioral science related to PrEP (Dr. Amy Corneli), the use of mHealth technology in Black MSM (Dr. Sara LeGrand), and biostatistics (Dr. Cliburn Chan). Also included as collaborators are Dr. Arlene Seña, an expert in STIs who is Medical Director of the Durham County Department of Public Health, Dr. Mehri McKellar, the Medical Director of the Duke PrEP clinic, Dr. John Mitchell, a clinical psychologist who has pioneered the mobile app mSMART in PrEP users, Dr. Lisa Hightow-Weidman, a recognized leader in the field of technology based interventions aimed at HIV/STI prevention in young MSM, and Dr. Kenneth Mayer, a world expert in biomedical HIV prevention and the intersection of STIs and PrEP. The proposed aims and accompanying training plan will allow Dr. Clement to mature into an independent researcher in HIV/STI prevention and provide a basis for an R01 to implement her mobile technology intervention for STI prevention in Black MSM PrEP users. PROJECT NARRATIVE STI incidence continues to climb nationally and Black men who have sex with men (MSM) prescribed pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are particularly at risk. New strategies to reduce STI rates in this group are warranted, with attention to social factors that drive sexual risk taking. Mobile health applications offering peer support are a promising solution to effect behavioral change and reduce STI incidence in Black MSM prescribed PrEP. !",mHealth Peer Support to Reduce Rates of

"UMB Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of Ph.D. students from diverse backgrounds is acutely underrepresented in biomedical and behavioral sciences in the United States despite the growing proportions of minorities in the population. Through participation in several underrepresented minority (UR)-focused mentoring programs, the Science Training for Advancing Biomedical Research (STAR)-PREP director brings unique insights (from a mentee's perspective) and a great understanding of the attributes required for being a successful mentor. This STAR- PREP is designed to provide aspiring UR biomedical scientists with a specialized but comprehensive training plan. Highly functional and dynamic individual development plans (IDP) will be employed to address the Scholars' weaknesses and strengthen their skills to increase their competitiveness leading to acceptance into top-notch Ph.D. or M.D.-Ph.D. programs. We will take advantage of ongoing interactions with local UR- centered undergraduate programs and with various established programs including T32 grants on campus by incorporating into IDPs regular participation in T32-funded training activities. Our hypothesis is that active participation in an integrated multidimensional research, clinical and mentored research training program coupled with innovations in academic development will result in greater than 75% of PREP Scholars pursuing biomedical research careers. Aim 1 is to ensure an outstanding biomedical research experience to build and refine the STAR-PREP Scholar's research skills. This will be accomplished through use of a diverse community of outstanding faculty and students, state-of-the-art technologies and innovations in interdisciplinary education and training in an atmosphere that explicitly emphasizes excellence and biomedical research. Aim 2 is to strengthen and expand the STAR-PREP Scholar's academic portfolio to facilitate acceptance into a top-notch graduate program. This aim will also support and guide the PREP Scholar thru every step of the graduate school application process, prepare the Scholar for the GRE test and provide direct experience in select Ph.D. courses. Through Aim 3, we will provide a set of high- quality professional development activities individualized for each STAR-PREP Scholar. PREP Scholars will participate in a variety of research poster presentation forums, scientific writing workshops, diversity seminars and attend/present at a national science conference. Aim 4 will provide a continuous dynamic mentoring and community-building research-centered experience. Through this aim we propose to establish a sense of community through social and academic activities between Scholars, mentors and Ph.D. students. The success of each of our aims will be regularly assessed through individual diagnostic assessment tools administered by internal and external evaluators to ensure a positive and meaningful experience to successfully transition Scholars to graduate programs.

"UMass Amherst PREP Program PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The long-term goal of this project is to significantly increase the number of students from underrepresented groups who obtain PhD degrees in biomedical and biobehavioral fields. To this end, we will sponsor a one- year PREP internship that includes individualized programs of independent research, multi-tiered mentoring, and professional development with an interdisciplinary focus. The proposed activities are designed to increase the competitiveness of the PREP students for admission to rigorous biomedical graduate programs. Our project will capitalize on several unique strengths: A) Leadership of the Northeast Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NEAGEP), a highly interactive network of 15 institutions with demonstrated success in recruiting and retaining minority students in STEM PhD programs; B) Well-developed programs of interdisciplinary research and graduate education in biomedicine; C) Effective multi-level mentoring programs to support diversity at all levels of academia. We have hosted 63 PREP Scholars over the past 8 years. Of the 61 who applied, 96.8% were accepted, but nearly 15% chose to go to MD or professional MS programs. 85.3% of those who enrolled in PhD programs graduated within 6 years or are in good standing. This is a very high compared with the national 6-year completion rate of approximately 40% and 10-year completion of approximately 60% in similar disciplines. But, based on our self-study, we think it is feasible to reduce attrition at these stages even more. Therefore our aims are to: 1) Increase the percentage of PREP Scholars who enter PhD programs to at least 90% by:  a) Expanding our recruiting network to increase the number of applicants;  b) Revising our application and selection process to better identify students committed to research careers;  c) Fueling interest in earning PhD through activities of an intensive summer program that strengthens self-  identification as scientists, builds a cohesive community and immerses them in research. 2) Reduce the percentage of PREP Scholars who leave PhD programs to less than 10% by:  a) Enhancing our well-developed mentoring models by requiring specially developed mentoring workshops  for faculty who mentor PREP Scholars.  b) Conducting interactive, facilitated workshops wherein PREP Scholars and their mentors explore issues  confronted by minority students in majority institutions.  c) Continuing support of PREP Scholars after they enter graduate programs at UMA or elsewhere. We anticipate that PREP Scholars will enroll in one of the numerous graduate programs served by the participating interdisciplinary training programs, graduate programs in other NEAGEP institutions or in other selective graduate programs around the country. Our program will help meet the national need for biomedical researchers who can address issues of health care in all segments of our population. 352-(&7 N$55$7,9( The underrepresentation of U.S. minorities in the biomedical and behavioral research workforce increases reliance on international talent and exacerbates healthcare disparities among racial and socioeconomic groups.

"Increasing Uptake of HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis among Young, Black MSM in the South PROJECT SUMMARY: The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to provide Latesha Elopre, MD, MSPH the essential mentorship and career development necessary to become an independent investigator whose research will contribute to decreasing health inequity among underserved and disproportionately impacted populations regarding HIV infection rates. The initial focus of her work will be in developing a behavioral intervention to increase uptake of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among young, Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Deep South. Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 50% of black MSM will become infected with HIV in their lifetime. Furthermore, the Southern United States is seeing the highest rates of new HIV infections in this population, with rates rapidly increasing for young, black MSM. Through consistent use of PrEP, a biomedical prevention tool, decreased HIV infection rates can be seen among young, Black MSM. Research focusing on increasing HIV prevention services and decreasing health disparities in HIV incidence have been high priority for the NIH. However, there have been few studies evaluating PrEP uptake among young, Black MSM in the Deep South. In concordance with prior research that has shown individual and structural factors leading to increased stigma and marginalization for black MSM, this study will be grounded in the Andersen Behavioral Model for Healthcare Utilization with subsequent individual level intervention driven by the situated Information, Motivation and Behavioral skills theoretical framework. This conceptual model will allow for investigation of core determinants of health behavior in the context of individual and societal barriers influencing health service utilization. A mixed-methods research design will aid in targeted intervention development with a more granular understanding of potential barriers for PrEP uptake. Hypothesis: Characteristics that pertain to stigma related to PrEP, HIV, race, religion and poverty as well as healthcare access will be major barriers to awareness and uptake of PrEP for young, Black MSM in the South. The specific aims for this research proposal are as follows: Aim 1: Determine critical beliefs and attitudes regarding PrEP awareness and uptake among young, Black MSM in the South. Aim 2: Determine environmental barriers for delivery of PrEP to young, black MSM in the South. Aim 3: Develop a targeted intervention to increase PrEP uptake among young, Black MSM in the South. With guidance from my mentorship team, a career development plan has been created to gain training in behavioral theory, intervention development and mixed-methods research design enabled by additional coursework, hands on training, seminars and national workshops. Upon completion of the proposed scientific aims, I will be poised to pilot a theory-guided behavioral intervention to enhance PrEP uptake among young black MSM in the U.S. Deep South supported by an R-series grant. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Disproportionately high numbers of HIV infection are seen among young, Black men who have sex with men (MSM) who live in the Southern United States. New estimates from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention predict 1 in 2 Black MSM will be infected with HIV in their lifetime. Biomedical HIV prevention strategies, such as HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), have been shown to effectively decrease rates of HIV infection by up to 92% with consistent use. The project described in this application will develop a theory- driven behavioral intervention, utilizing a mixed-methods research design, to increase uptake of PrEP among young, Black MSM in the South.","Increasing Uptake of HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis among Young, Black MSM in the South",9632843,K23MH112417,"['Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', '

"Offering women PrEP with education, shared decision-making and trauma-informed care: the OPENS trial PROJECT SUMMARY  Although 13% of the U.S. female population is Black, 60% of new HIV diagnoses in U.S. women are in Black women. The South is the epicenter of the U.S. HIV epidemic, including in women, and Black Southern women are disproportionately affected: Black women account for 69% of new HIV diagnoses in women in the South. As the first highly effective, discrete, woman-controlled HIV prevention method, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine radically expands HIV prevention options for women. However, uptake of PrEP in U.S. women has lagged, particularly among groups most affected by HIV. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates 468,000 women in the U.S. are eligible for PrEP, but only approximately 19,000 have ever been prescribed PrEP. Moreover, despite disparities in incident HIV in U.S. women, White women are 4 times more likely to have received PrEP than Black women.  PrEP cascades outline the necessary steps for accessing PrEP, including screening and identifying eligible individuals, linkage to care, prescription and initiation of PrEP. Data suggest there are multilevel barriers related to the process of screening for HIV risk in women and identifying potential PrEP candidates that may drive a significant drop off early in the PrEP cascade for women. The objective of this proposal is to improve mechanisms of offering PrEP to women through use of a patient-level intervention—an HIV prevention decision support tool (DST); a provider-level intervention—training on shared decision-making; and a clinic-level intervention--training on trauma-informed care, with the goal of ultimately mitigating disparities in the HIV epidemic in women by increasing PrEP uptake in Southern U.S. women of color.  This study will occur at 2 reproductive health clinics in Duval County, Florida, were HIV incidence in women is high. In Aim 1, participants will be randomized to an HIV prevention DST coupled with standard counseling or standard counseling alone to evaluate the effect of the DST on PrEP prescriptions as well as patient experiences of PrEP care and counseling. In Aim 2, a 3-phase approach will be used to evaluate how provider training on shared decision making and clinic-wide training on trauma-informed care affect patient counseling and decision making about PrEP. Baseline data collected in Phase 1 will be compared to data collected after the trainings without use of the DST (Phase 2), and to data collected after the trainings with use of the DST (Phase 3). Data collection in each 3-month phase will include chart extraction on PrEP prescriptions, exit surveys with women about HIV prevention choices and quality of counseling, audio-taped counseling sessions, and interviews with women of color to explore experiences of HIV prevention counseling and care. In the final aim, the feasibility of disseminating the multilevel interventions described in Aims 1&2 will be assessed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, providing preliminary data on implementation. Narrative There are striking racial and regional disparities in HIV diagnoses in women in the U.S., as well as in utilization of effective HIV prevention methods such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention. Reasons for these disparities are multifactorial, and require multi-level interventions to address them. The objective of this study is to improve mechanisms of identifying women vulnerable to HIV in the Southern U.S. and offer them comprehensive HIV prevention methods, including PrEP, through use of a patient-level intervention—offering universal education about PrEP via an HIV prevention decision support tool--a provider-level intervention— training on shared decision-making—and a clinic-level intervention--training on trauma-informed care— ultimately mitigating disparities in the HIV epidemic in women by increasing PrEP uptake in Southern U.S. women of color.","Offering women PrEP with education, shared decision-making and trauma-informed care: the OPENS trial",9990158,R01MD013565,"['Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Privatization ', ' Qualitative Evaluations ', ' Quantitative Evaluations ', ' Risk ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' uptake ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' Reporting ', ' Contraceptive methods ', ' Inhibition of Fertilization ', ' Fertility Control ', ' Contraception ', ' HIV risk ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' emtricitabine ', "" beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine "", ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' implementation research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' Coupled ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' primary outcome ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' support tools ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' provider-level barriers ', ' provider barriers ', ' system-level barriers ', ' implementation strategy ', ' Affect ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Color ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Family Planning ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' Florida ', ' Fumarates ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,262307,0.32942067971199324
"PrEP Demonstration Project among Women at Risk for HIV Infection PROJECT SUMMARY African-American (AA) women living in the Deep South are 10 times more likely to be infected with HIV than white women. Traditional HIV prevention methods, including STI/HIV education, comprehensive behavioral interventions, and provision of condoms have rendered minimal success in this population. HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has become a promising biomedical prevention tool, with over 90% efficacy as shown in numerous trials. PrEP has the potential to curb incident HIV infection among at-risk women; however, biomedical HIV prevention work in the US has generally focused on men who have sex with men, often leaving women (particularly women of racial/ethnic minority status) underserved, and a disparity with respect to HIV infection inadequately addressed. Implementation science projects are urgently needed to evaluate and overcome barriers to PrEP awareness, uptake, adherence, and persistence in this population. The objective of this application is to increase PrEP uptake among AA women at-risk for HIV-infection in the rural South, specifically those seeking care at Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers (FQHC) in rural Alabama. We will use a mixed-methods approach to adapt and pilot test a patient-provider communication tool from the CDC PrEP toolkit that focuses on the first three steps of the PrEP cascade (e.g., recognizing HIV risk, identifying as a PrEP candidate, and interested in PrEP) to increase PrEP uptake via referrals to local PrEP clinics. Specifically, we propose: (1) to explore the HIV risk perceptions of AA women with recent PrEP use (N=15-25), AA women who are candidates for PrEP (N=15-25), and providers (N=20) and identify preferences around patient-provider communication about HIV risk and PrEP services that address the needs of AA women; (2A) To systematically adapt a patient-provider communication tool to increase PrEP uptake at two FQHCs in rural Alabama, using an iterative implementation process; and (2B). To assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of the patient-provider communication intervention on PrEP uptake among AA women and their providers in a pilot pre-/post-intervention design (N=250). As part of aim 2B), we will also systematically document and evaluate reasons for declining a PrEP referral, reasons for incomplete referrals, reasons for failing to initiate PrEP after a successful referral, and ongoing PrEP use at 3/6 months post PrEP initiation among our sample. The proposed work will significantly contribute to our understanding of factors impacting PrEP uptake and use among AA women at high-risk for HIV-infection, particularly in underserved, rural areas in the Deep South that are increasingly impacted by the HIV epidemic and have worse health outcomes relative to other areas in the US. The results of this work will also directly contribute to a full-scale, R01-level cluster randomized implementation trial in which we will measure the effectiveness and cost associated with a PrEP services delivery intervention serving AA women at-risk for HIV-infection in primary care and reproductive health centers in rural areas of the Deep South. PROJECT NARRATIVE African American women (AA), particularly those living in the rural southeastern United States, remain persistently at risk for HIV infection. Pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PrEP) is a highly effective HIV prevention tool that may circumvent barriers to the use of traditional HIV prevention tools, such as condom use; however, we know very little about how to help AA women at high-risk for HIV-infection effectively access and use PrEP during periods of risk. This project seeks to understand how to make PrEP more accessible to these women, which may ultimately affect HIV incidence in this population.",PrEP Demonstration Project among Women at Risk for HIV Infection,9844657,R34MH118044,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Alabama ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Cause of Death ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Family Planning ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Southeast US ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' statistics ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' women at high risk ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care seeking ', ' condoms ', ' Prevention ', ' HIV risk ', ' risk perception ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' microbicide ', ' microbicidal ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Communication Tools ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' post intervention ', ' implementation trial ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' underserved rural area ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' aged ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' effectiveness measure ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' screening ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' rural counties ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' service delivery ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R34,2019,249691,0.30855673262086025
"Individual-level and Social Network-level Information on HIV Prevention Methods Among Young Black Women ABSTRACT Young Black women (YBW) between the ages of 18 to 24 have higher rates of HIV than any other age or race and ethnicity group of women in Los Angeles County. Social networks of YBW could be both protective and risky via social influence and sexual-health-related communication. Yet there is a dearth of literature on YBW and their social network members (SNMs), particularly regarding how social networks can be used for HIV prevention and treatment. With the current HIV/AIDS priorities of decreasing incidence of HIV and increasing the use of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among high-risk groups, examining YBW and their social networks is essential in understanding how to use these networks to implement preventive interventions such as PrEP among high-risk YBW. The proposed two-year Ruth L. Kirshstein NRSA study seeks to reduce HIV/AIDS incidence among YBW aged 18–24 by investigating condom use, HIV testing, and knowledge and perceptions of PrEP as tools to prevent HIV among YBW. To achieve this goal, the proposed study will examine 200 YBW and their SNMs to explore YBW’s social media usage and its association with sexual risk and protective behaviors (i.e., HIV testing, condom use, and interest in PrEP) among YBW (Aim 1); identify subgroups profiles of YBW based on individual- and social-network-level risk factors and investigate whether HIV testing, condom use, and interest in PrEP are key indicators of those subgroups (Aim 2); and investigate whether social network and SNM characteristics are associated with HIV testing, condom use, and interest in PrEP among YBW (Aim 3). Preliminary results from the proposed PI’s pilot study examining 78 YBW women and their SNMs (n = 1,068) revealed that YBW spoke to approximately 55% of their SNMs about sex, 32% about condoms, and 21% about testing for HIV. Additionally, individual-level descriptive statistics revealed that a majority of these women were sexually active (85%), yet very few of the sexually active women used condoms during their last sexual activity (vaginal or anal sex; 19.7%, n = 13). Furthermore, 76% of the women in the study had not heard of PrEP. After a brief description of PrEP, 47% of the YBW reported being interested in taking PrEP as a tool for HIV prevention. Due to the small sample size of YBW (n = 78), there was not enough power in the pilot study to examine associations at the individual level (i.e., condom use, HIV testing, and interest in PrEP). More importantly, individual-level risk-taking behaviors could not be correlated with network variables. Thus, these pilot study data are not sufficient to address the current aims of the proposed study. This proposed study will address these individual-level limitations by recruiting 200 YBW. Findings from this study will provide insight regarding factors not typically examined, such as YBW’s knowledge and perceptions of PrEP and the association of their social networks, HIV risk behaviors, and social media use with condom use, HIV testing, and interest in PrEP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Young Black Women (YBW) are disproportionately affected by HIV. This study will contribute to effective HIV risk behavior interventions for YBW by understanding social network-level and individual-level behavioral influences that contribute to condom use, HIV testing and interest in PrEP use among this population. Specifically, social network analysis coupled with the analysis of subgroup profiles (i.e. Latent Class Analysis) will elucidate characteristics at the individual-level and social network-level that are associated with varying levels of condom use, HIV testing, and interest in PrEP use.",Individual-level and Social Network-level Information on HIV Prevention Methods Among Young Black Women,9689843,F31MD012211,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Appointment ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Literature ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Love ', ' Methods ', ' Perception ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Play ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Science ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Social Interaction ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vagina ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Friends ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' sexually active ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Sample Size ', ' Homeless Youth ', ' Homeless Children ', ' Respondent ', ' Anal Sex ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' interest ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Emotional ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' NRSA ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' protective behavior ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Coupled ', ' high risk ', ' social media ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' recruit ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk behavior ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,F31,2019,30409,0.3082849747279953
"Brown University Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program Project Summary/Abstract Assessment of current programs designed to increase diversity in STEM disciplines at Brown University has revealed the need to specifically address the critical transition from undergraduate into doctoral training programs. The goal of Brown PREP is to diversify and enrich the biomedical research endeavor by increasing the number of students enrolled in and completing doctoral training programs. Informed by best practices and lessons learned from an institutional pilot PREP program, we describe an innovative program characterized by a comprehensive and customizable set of interventions to support and advance underrepresented students' academic and career development.  Each year, our program will recruit and support eight research-oriented baccalaureate graduates from underrepresented backgrounds and provide them with interdisciplinary research experiences, individualized academic planning, professional development, and skill-building activities to increase their competitiveness and readiness for high-caliber doctoral programs. Participating departments for Brown's proposed PREP reside in the Life and Medical Sciences Division and include biology, neuroscience, psychology, public health and cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences.  In addition to intensive interdisciplinary research experiences and knowledge development, multiple mentorship and community building opportunities permeate the activities of the Brown PREP. Creating a community of scholars that will help students successfully navigate program requirements is viewed as essential to helping students reach their full potential in a short period of time. The use of Individual Development Plans (IDP) will ensure that the Brown PREP research, educational and professional development activities are specifically tailored to address each student's academic and career goals. As important, the Brown PREP will provide opportunities for faculty to engage in conversations about the importance of developing a diverse workforce in the biomedical and behavioral sciences. We have developed a comprehensive evaluation plan to assess outcomes and progress toward meeting the overall goal and aims of this project and monitor quality assurance across the proposed interventions.  As designed, the Brown PREP will increase the production of underrepresented students who obtain a doctoral degree in the biomedical sciences; institutionalize best practices on training and mentoring diverse scholars that can be shared among the Brown community and beyond; and diversify the biomedical research workforce. Project Narrative This program addresses an important societal need to increase the number of individuals from underrepresented backgrounds who enter and complete doctoral programs in the biomedical and behavioral sciences.

"Increasing PrEP Use in High-Risk Social Networks of African American MSM in Underserved Low-Uptake Cities Abstract  PrEP is a powerful and potentially groundbreaking HIV prevention strategy, but its public health impact will depend on widescale adoption by persons at greatest risk for contracting HIV infection. PrEP awareness and use remain especially low among African American MSM in mid-sized cities across the center of the country, and very little research has tested interventions that can increase PrEP awareness, benefit perception, and normative support—and decrease PrEP stigma and concerns—among African American MSM in these cities. PrEP can achieve its full public health potential only when its uptake among racial minority MSM in neglected mid-sized American cities is increased. In prior research, our team established that network-level interventions can reach and be used to deliver effective HIV risk reduction interventions to Black MSM in the industrial Midwest, including hard-to-reach men hidden in the community. The planned mixed- methods research will now evaluate a network intervention to increase PrEP uptake among high-risk African American MSM in Milwaukee and Cleveland, cities where HIV racial disparities are profound but PrEP use is low. In a formative research phase, in-depth interviews will be conducted with African American MSM, PrEP providers, and other key informants in each city to identify understandings, concerns, barriers, and facilitators of PrEP use. In the main intervention trial phase, 36 social networks of high-risk racial minority MSM (expected n=504 participants) will be enrolled, 18 networks per city, by recruiting high-risk initial “seeds,” members of each seed's MSM friendship network, and then two outward successive rings of their friends. All study participants will receive baseline counseling for PrEP and risk reduction. The 36 networks will then be randomized in equal numbers to intervention and comparison conditions. In each intervention condition network, a cadre of network leaders open to PrEP, trusted for advice, and highly interconnected with others will attend an intervention that educates and then provides training and guidance in diffusing messages to friends to encourage PrEP uptake, correcting PrEP misconceptions and stigma, and instilling positive PrEP norms and benefit perceptions. At baseline and 6- and 15-month followup points, participants will complete measures of PrEP use corroborated by the testing of dried blood spot specimens for tenofovir; measures of PrEP related knowledge, attitudes, perceived norms, and stage of change readiness; sexual risk practices; and substance use. We hypothesize that the network intervention will produce greater PrEP adoption by HIV- participants than that found in comparison networks. PrEP knowledge, attitudes, intentions, peer norms, and stage of change readiness will be explored as both mediators and as secondary outcomes. Intervention effects on HIV incidence will be mathematically modeled to determine its public health impact. This research will test a novel approach for increasing PrEP use among neglected racial minority MSM in mid-sized American cities who can best—and can perhaps only—be reached through their social network connections. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) regimens greatly reduce the likelihood that high-risk uninfected men who have sex with men (MSM) will contract HIV infection. However, PrEP use remains very low in mid-sized cities across the country, especially among African American MSM who may be hidden in the community and hard to reach through conventional PrEP awareness campaigns. This research will employ a social network approach for both reaching racial minority MSM in the community and delivering an intervention in which peer network leaders are taught and enlisted to increase awareness, correct misconceptions, reduce stigma, and increase benefit perception and positive attitudes of their network members toward PrEP. Results of the study will improve models for HIV prevention implementation science among African American MSM in neglected regions of the country.  ",Increasing PrEP Use in High-Risk Social Networks of African American MSM in Underserved Low-Uptake Cities,9710709,R01NR017574,"['Adoption ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Goals ', ' positive attitude ', ' Happiness ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Industrialization ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Persons ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' seed ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Seeds ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Stereotyping ', ' great pox ', ' Syphilis ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' Friendships ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' improved ', ' Diffuse ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' uptake ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Community Networks ', ' Spottings ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' behavior change ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' HIV risk ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' neglect ', ' community intervention ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Regimen ', ' Prevention trial ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' peer networks ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' support network ', ' racial minority ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NINR,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R01,2019,678825,0.3182091571784418
"Following a U.S. National Cohort of Vulnerable Men to Improve HIV Prevention and Care Project Summary  RFA-AI-16-031 (LITE) is designed to address critical needs in HIV prevention research by using innovative technology to enroll and follow large-scale epidemiological cohorts of those at highest risk of infection. The proposed project will utilize established Internet-based strategies, previously used successfully by the research team, to enroll a sample of 5,000 high-risk HIV-negative gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM) ages 16 to 49—the population representing the highest percentage of new infections annually—and follow them prospectively for four years. The design features of our proposal were chosen specifically to: (a) identify individual-, network-, and contextual-level predictors and correlates of HIV seroconversion, (b) identify missed HIV prevention opportunities among those seroconverting during the course of the study, and, thus (c) inform interventions to further reduce acquisition and transmission.  We define “high-risk” as meeting CDC guidelines for PrEP treatment, but not taking PrEP. Participants will complete annual self-administered at-home rapid HIV testing (results submitted via digital photo of the test paddle) as well as brief (~20 min) at-home computerized surveys. In addition to being referred for treatment, study participants who seroconvert will complete a semi-structured telephone interview to identify missed HIV prevention opportunities and the contextual factors involved. We will monitor newly diagnosed participants' movement through the HIV care continuum. Based on current incidence rates, we anticipate accumulating ~252 infections during the study; however, because we are targeting high-risk men, this number could be higher. Aim 1 (UG3 Phase): Establish a cohort of 5,000 high-risk HIV-negative GBM who are not on PrEP, all of  whom complete baseline online surveys and at-home self-administered HIV testing, as well as consent for  longitudinal follow-up. Determine PrEP uptake and HIV incidence 12 months after study enrollment.  Supplemental Aims: Using the cross sectional data from GBM deemed ineligible during screening for study eligibility: Sup. Aim 1a—Estimate the uptake of PrEP; and Sup. Aim 1b—Characterize missed HIV  prevention opportunities (e.g., reasons for no prior PrEP use) among recent HIV seroconverters. Aim 2 (UH3 Phase): Follow the cohort for four years to characterize (2a) individual/network/contextual-level  determinants of PrEP uptake/discontinuation; (2b) new HIV seroconversions and missed HIV prevention  opportunities, including individual/network/contextual-level determinants; (2c) racial/ethnic disparities in  HIV incidence and their trends over time; and (2d) the influence of PrEP uptake on racial/ethnic disparities. Project Summary  This study will characterize HIV incidence and PrEP in a U.S. national sample of 5000 vulnerable men at risk for HIV. We will use technology-mediated methods to follow the sample for four years. Because participation in research studies that include frequent in-person contact with research personnel can impact participant behavior in ways that make them less representative of the high-risk populations from which they were drawn, we will utilize technological approaches to facilitate participation that are minimally invasive, and that incentivizes participation with nominal behavioral interference.",Following a U.S. National Cohort of Vulnerable Men to Improve HIV Prevention and Care,9955489,UH3AI133675,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Color ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Geography ', ' Hawthorne Effect ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incentives ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Telephone Interviews ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Persons ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Self Administration ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Bisexual ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' improved ', ' sample collection ', ' specimen collection ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Gays ', ' uptake ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Test Result ', ' psychosocial ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' meetings ', ' innovative technologies ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' minimally invasive ', ' screening ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' seroconversion ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' Time trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', ' urban setting ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' recruit ', ' infection risk ', ' ']",NIAID,GRADUATE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH POLICY,UH3,2019,1402677,0.25580151886755015
"Multilevel determinants of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) utilization and health disparities among Black and Hispanic women Women constitute a substantial proportion (20%) of new HIV diagnoses in the U.S., with the majority of infections occurring in women of color: Black and Latina women together account for 77% of newly diagnosed women nationally but represent 30% of the female population. Gender-based social inequalities combined with men’s control over HIV prevention methods, such as condoms and viral suppression, have traditionally limited women’s options with regard to self-protective risk behavior. HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken as a once-daily pill (Truvada) represents an historic breakthrough in HIV prevention for women, as it is the first commercially available effective method that is independent of the sexual act and can be controlled by women. Yet, only about 4% of women who are at high risk of HIV are taking the drug. Moreover, despite being at greatest risk for HIV Black and Latina women are the least likely to take PrEP. Women of color thus confront dual HIV-related health disparities: they have disproportionately high rates of HIV infection but disproportionately low rates of PrEP use for HIV prevention. The reasons for the low PrEP use among Black and Latina women are not well-understood. To address this gap, we propose a mixed methods longitudinal cohort study with the following specific aims: (1) characterize the PrEP care continuum (PrEP-CC; awareness, linkage, uptake, retention and adherence) among women at high risk for HIV, including health disparities; (2) identify determinants at multiple levels (societal, healthcare setting, community, interpersonal, individual) associated with PrEP-CC outcomes, including health disparities; (3) determine which healthcare provision strategies and programs promote improvement of PrEP-CC outcomes for women; and (4) explore providers’ attitudes, perspectives, practices, and environments that shape PrEP provision behavior and patient interactions. A conceptual framework integrating socioecological theory with the Gelberg-Andersen behavioral model and the Theory of Gender and Power will guide this work. The study will be conducted in two cities in New York State: New York City and Rochester. New York State has the second largest racial health disparity in HIV in the nation. A cohort (N=360) of women (80% minority) who are either taking PrEP or eligible for PrEP will be enrolled and assessed quarterly for 12 months to obtain survey, biometric, and medical record data. Sampling and recruitment strategies will involve respondent driven sampling methods in combination with time-location sampling. Community-level socioeconomic data and healthcare site- level data will also be obtained. Analyses of quantitative data will estimate within- and between-subject effects of multilevel predictors on PrEP-CC outcomes. Time-to-event analysis will also be employed to model stages along the PrEP-CC. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with a subsample of 50 women (stratified by PrEP use and race/ethnicity), and 18 clinical providers to provide contextual data for triangulation. Findings from this study will provide an evidence-base upon which to develop and evaluate interventions, programs and services for women of color to address HIV and PrEP outcomes and health disparities. Public Health Relevance: The use of antiretroviral medication—brand name Truvada—for the prevention of HIV (pre-exposure prophylaxis; PrEP) among Black and Latina women in the U.S. has the potential to significantly reduce disproportionately high rates of HIV in these groups. However, adoption of PrEP by women of color has been very limited, thereby reducing the public health benefit of PrEP to address racial and ethnic disparities in HIV transmission among women. The proposed study is designed to provide a knowledge base regarding key obstacles and facilitators of PrEP utilization that can be applied to develop effective PrEP interventions and delivery models for Black and Latina women.",Multilevel determinants of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) utilization and health disparities among Black and Hispanic women,9781759,R01MD013553,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Cities ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Decision Making ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Medical Directors ', ' Physician Executives ', ' Medical Records ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Optimizing PrEP Utilization among Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Using Women of Color Project Summary As we edge closer to the half century mark of the HIV epidemic, the disproportionate effect on women of color in the U.S. continues to be jolting. Women overall have been at a disadvantage in the epidemic due to gender differences and norms that shape biological, social and economic vulnerability. Racial and ethnic disparities magnify the risk. Co-factors such as alcohol and other drug (AOD) use intersect and reinforce other comorbidities. Living in a high prevalence area significantly hardens the risk and makes it tougher to overcome. Options to help women stay HIV negative have been limited. However, this obstacle shifted several years ago with FDA approval and CDC endorsement of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Yet, the majority of U.S. women do not know that PrEP can be a female-controlled strategy or that it applies to them—and backup has not been forthcoming from providers or their communities. What is most disturbing, however, is the absence of PrEP as an accessible strategy among women of color in high impact regions of the country. This developmental U34 responds to RFA-AA-17-013, which prioritizes community based participatory research (CBPR) to develop implementation models for women that address alcohol and HIV in high impact regions and communities. The proposed study will produce an evidence- and CBPR-driven PrEP implementation intervention to enhance uptake and optimize use among women of color in South Florida, which is currently the highest impact region of the U.S. with HIV rates recently determined by the CDC to be the highest in the nation. The study builds upon the team’s experience in alcohol/HIV intervention and CBPR in South Florida and preliminary work with stakeholders from the greater Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas to develop a multi- level PrEP intervention program for African American, Latina, and Haitian women who engage in risky sex and AOD use. The study includes researchers from the Southern HIV and Alcohol Research Consortium (SHARC) and will inform the design of target and comparison groups and other features of a U01 for further study within the NIAAA CHAART Consortia. Guided by the social ecological framework, the study will: identify needs, priorities, and community strengths and develop a PrEP continuum during a summit to engage stakeholders (Aim 1); produce a replicable implementation program, including manuals, materials, instruments, and procedures, through the formation of a Community Advisory and Advocacy Board (Aim 2); and conduct an exploratory pilot among 120 multi-ethnic women of color in Broward and Miami-Dade counties to test fidelity, feasibility and acceptability and measure PrEP uptake and adherence and retention in care over a 6 month period. The study will utilize biomarkers in a subsample to compare with self-reports and pharmacy refill measures. It will be among the first to develop a PrEP intervention in the South for women of color, and is thus in line with the specific high funding priorities of the Office of AIDS Research on cross-cutting research to reduce health disparities in developing implementation approaches for bio-behavioral strategies such as PrEP. Public Health Relevance Despite FDA approval in 2012, followed by recommendations from the CDC and WHO, the majority of women in the U.S. are not aware of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as an HIV prevention strategy that applies to them. The purpose of this study is to use a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) model to develop and preliminarily test an intervention program that will optimize oral PrEP utilization among women of color in South Florida, the region with the highest HIV rates in the U.S. The intervention will evaluate fidelity, feasibility and acceptability, determine patterns of PrEP uptake and adherence and retention in care, and explore the known correlates of risk such as AOD use.",Optimizing PrEP Utilization among Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Using Women of Color,9778700,U34AA026219,"['Acquired

"Promoting Reductions in Intersectional Stigma to Improve HIV Testing and PrEP Use Among Latino Sexual Minority Men PROJECT SUMMARY HIV prevention continuum disparities persist among Latinos in the U.S., especially those who are immigrants and sexual minority men (SMM). Latinos tend to be diagnosed with HIV (i.e., tested) at a later disease stage and use pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) at much lower rates than do Whites. However, of the existing evidence-based HIV prevention interventions, only one was developed for Latino SMM, and none have yet been developed or assessed for PrEP uptake. Based on the scientific premise and empirical evidence that stigma contributes meaningfully to HIV disparities, we propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an 8-session cognitive behavior therapy group intervention, Siempre Seguiré (“I will continue being”; named by community stakeholders after a popular song conveying gay empowerment), which aims to increase effective coping responses to stigma from intersectional identities (related to ethnicity, immigration status, and sexual minority identity) among Latino SMM, with the goal of improving HIV prevention continuum outcomes. Siempre Seguiré has a strong scientific basis in our prior pilot work, which found that the proposed intervention is acceptable to key stakeholders, feasible to conduct, and associated with improved effective coping and increased trust in providers and healthcare. The specific aims are: (1) To conduct a randomized controlled trial of Siempre Seguiré, a culturally congruent cognitive behavior therapy group intervention for immigrant Latino sexual minority men, to test intervention effects on regular HIV testing and PrEP uptake; (2) To examine mechanisms of intervention effects on regular HIV testing and PrEP uptake, including more effective coping (e.g., reduced internalized stigma, anticipated stigma, and medical mistrust); and (3) To conduct a cost- effectiveness analysis of the intervention. In the context of an established community-academic partnership, we will conduct the RCT with 300 immigrant Latino SMM, randomizing 150 to the intervention and 150 to an attention control group (a community-based wellness-oriented support group, with sessions matched to the intervention condition in number, timing, and length). Participants will complete surveys at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months post-baseline to assess the primary outcomes, potential mediators, covariates, and moderators. Regular HIV testing will be confirmed with official copies of HIV testing results, and PrEP uptake will be confirmed through copies of prescriptions, medical records, and urine testing. With the exception of our own work, we are not aware of any interventions that address coping with stigma from intersecting identities in order to improve health outcomes. Our research is consistent with Healthy People 2020, which recommends developing interventions to address effects of stigma among sexual minority individuals. Although structural- level interventions are critical for reducing societal stigma as a long-term strategy, individual-level interventions—such as Siempre Seguiré—are needed in tandem to reduce stigma’s immediate health effects. PROJECT NARRATIVE Latinos in the U.S., especially those who are immigrants and sexual minority men (SMM), are highly affected by HIV-related disparities, tending to be diagnosed at a later disease stage, leading to delays in antiretroviral treatment use and lower rates of viral suppression. No culturally congruent interventions have been developed to address intersectional HIV-related stigmas, a key contributor to disparities in the HIV prevention continuum among Latino SMM. We propose a randomized controlled trial of an 8-session cognitive behavior therapy group intervention that aims to increase regular HIV testing and PrEP uptake by increasing effective coping responses to intersectional stigmas from ethnicity, immigration status, sexual minority identity, HIV, and PrEP among Latino SMM.",Promoting Reductions in Intersectional Stigma to Improve HIV Testing and PrEP Use Among Latino Sexual Minority Men,9852507,R01MH121256,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Immigration ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medical Records ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Names ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' Research ', ' self help organization ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' Support Groups ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' uptake ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' programs ', ' Test Result ', ' Viral ', ' Services ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' empowerment ', ' Reporting ', ' acute stress ', ' Modeling ', ' psychoeducation ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Minority ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' sexual minority ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' attentional control ', ' intersectionality ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' barrier to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' ']",NIMH,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2019,733752,0.09646119037755754
"Offering women PrEP with education, shared decision-making and trauma-informed care: the OPENS trial PROJECT SUMMARY  Although 13% of the U.S. female population is Black, 60% of new HIV diagnoses in U.S. women are in Black women. The South is the epicenter of the U.S. HIV epidemic, including in women, and Black Southern women are disproportionately affected: Black women account for 69% of new HIV diagnoses in women in the South. As the first highly effective, discrete, woman-controlled HIV prevention method, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine radically expands HIV prevention options for women. However, uptake of PrEP in U.S. women has lagged, particularly among groups most affected by HIV. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates 468,000 women in the U.S. are eligible for PrEP, but only approximately 19,000 have ever been prescribed PrEP. Moreover, despite disparities in incident HIV in U.S. women, White women are 4 times more likely to have received PrEP than Black women.  PrEP cascades outline the necessary steps for accessing PrEP, including screening and identifying eligible individuals, linkage to care, prescription and initiation of PrEP. Data suggest there are multilevel barriers related to the process of screening for HIV risk in women and identifying potential PrEP candidates that may drive a significant drop off early in the PrEP cascade for women. The objective of this proposal is to improve mechanisms of offering PrEP to women through use of a patient-level intervention—an HIV prevention decision support tool (DST); a provider-level intervention—training on shared decision-making; and a clinic-level intervention--training on trauma-informed care, with the goal of ultimately mitigating disparities in the HIV epidemic in women by increasing PrEP uptake in Southern U.S. women of color.  This study will occur at 2 reproductive health clinics in Duval County, Florida, were HIV incidence in women is high. In Aim 1, participants will be randomized to an HIV prevention DST coupled with standard counseling or standard counseling alone to evaluate the effect of the DST on PrEP prescriptions as well as patient experiences of PrEP care and counseling. In Aim 2, a 3-phase approach will be used to evaluate how provider training on shared decision making and clinic-wide training on trauma-informed care affect patient counseling and decision making about PrEP. Baseline data collected in Phase 1 will be compared to data collected after the trainings without use of the DST (Phase 2), and to data collected after the trainings with use of the DST (Phase 3). Data collection in each 3-month phase will include chart extraction on PrEP prescriptions, exit surveys with women about HIV prevention choices and quality of counseling, audio-taped counseling sessions, and interviews with women of color to explore experiences of HIV prevention counseling and care. In the final aim, the feasibility of disseminating the multilevel interventions described in Aims 1&2 will be assessed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, providing preliminary data on implementation. Narrative There are striking racial and regional disparities in HIV diagnoses in women in the U.S., as well as in utilization of effective HIV prevention methods such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention. Reasons for these disparities are multifactorial, and require multi-level interventions to address them. The objective of this study is to improve mechanisms of identifying women vulnerable to HIV in the Southern U.S. and offer them comprehensive HIV prevention methods, including PrEP, through use of a patient-level intervention—offering universal education about PrEP via an HIV prevention decision support tool--a provider-level intervention— training on shared decision-making—and a clinic-level intervention--training on trauma-informed care— ultimately mitigating disparities in the HIV epidemic in women by increasing PrEP uptake in Southern U.S. women of color.","Offering women PrEP with education, shared decision-making and trauma-informed care: the OPENS trial",9768548,R01MD013565,"['Affect ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Color ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Family Planning ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' Florida ', ' Fumarates ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Privatization ', ' Qualitative Evaluations ', ' Quantitative Evaluations ', ' Risk ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' uptake ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' Reporting ', ' Contraceptive methods ', ' Inhibition of Fertilization ', ' Fertility Control ', ' Contraception ', ' HIV risk ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' emtricitabine ', "" beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine "", ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' implementation research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' Coupled ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' primary outcome ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' support tools ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' provider-level barriers ', ' provider barriers ', ' system-level barriers ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,495571,0.32942067971199324
"Characterizing the HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis care continuum for African American and Hispanic/Latino men who have sex with men PROJECT SUMMARY  Young African American (AA) and Hispanic/Latino (H/L) MSM bear a disproportionate share of the HIV disease burden in the United States (US). Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective in reducing HIV acquisition risks among MSM, but its ability to reduce HIV acquisition among AA and H/L MSM hinges on optimal implementation and expanded use in “real-world” clinical settings. Preliminary studies demonstrate that AA and H/L initiate PrEP and are retained in PrEP care at lower rates than their White counterparts, but little is known about longer-term adherence and retention in PrEP care among AA and H/L MSM. The manner in which structural, social, and individual level factors impact PrEP outcomes in real-world settings, particularly among young AA and H/L MSM, are not yet well understood. MSM who initiate PrEP may change behaviors (e.g., enter a monogamous relationship with an HIV negative partner) and no longer be indicated for PrEP. Furthermore, it is largely unknown why individuals, especially AA and H/L MSM, are not retained in PrEP care which complicates development of appropriate interventions to enhance retention in PrEP care. This proposed study follows a longitudinal, observational cohort (n=450) of White, AA and H/L MSM in real-world PrEP programs in Mississippi, Missouri, and Rhode Island to both characterize a PrEP care continuum and predict why MSM are sub-optimally adherent or lost to care, with a focus on measuring racial and ethnic disparities (Specific Aim 1). We will conduct individual interviews with MSM who are prescribed PrEP but sub-optimally adherent or drop out of PrEP care (Specific Aim 2) to elucidate reasons for sub-optimal adherence and retention and to identify components of potential interventions to improve adherence and retention in care. Using data from our longitudinal cohort, we will perform microsimulations in the context of an agent-based model to evaluate the impact of sub-optimal PrEP adherence and retention in care on HIV incidence in three diverse US settings. We will then predict the impact of potential interventions on PrEP care continuum outcomes (Specific Aim 3). PROJECT NARRATIVE  Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in preventing HIV transmission among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM). However, preliminary studies show that young African American and Hispanic/Latino MSM are retained in PrEP care at lower rates than their White counterparts. This study will follow a large, real-world cohort of MSM enrolled across three diverse United States settings to characterize rates of adherence and retention in PrEP care for young White, African American and Hispanic/Latino MSM, reasons for suboptimal adherence and retention in care, and the impact of different interventions to enhance adherence and retention in PrEP care outcomes on HIV incidence.",Characterizing the HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis care continuum for African American and Hispanic/Latino men who have sex with men,9723214,R01MH114657,"['HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Mississippi ', ' Missouri ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' Seasons ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Bisexual ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Gays ', ' uptake ', ' Spottings ', ' programs ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Drops ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' prospective ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' FDA approved ', ' primary outcome ', ' clinical infrastructure ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' retention rate ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' adherence rate ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geography ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' ']",NIMH,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R01,2019,665855,0.2793831013845346
"Developing a Patient Navigation Intervention for PrEP Continuum of Care among Young Latino MSM PROJECT SUMMARY Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the most at-risk group for contracting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the U.S., comprising 67% of new HIV diagnoses in 2014. However, the HIV epidemic impacts some groups of MSM disproportionately. Latino MSM comprise 25.1% of new HIV infections among MSM between the ages of 13 and 29 years. The daily medication tenofovir/emtricitabine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in 2012 and has demonstrated strong efficacy in reducing the risk of HIV infection. When taken consistently, PrEP has been shown to reduce new incidence of HIV by 92%. Despite the promise of PrEP to transform HIV prevention, there remain significant barriers to PrEP use among those who would benefit the most, resulting in low rates of uptake. Although Latino MSM have reported the lowest use of PrEP (6.6%), they also reported the greatest willingness to use PrEP compared to White and Black MSM. There have been no known interventions that have been designed to assist Latino MSM with accessing PrEP-related health care or adhering to PrEP. Patient navigation may be an ideal intervention to aid in PrEP uptake among Latino MSM by assisting individuals in overcoming barriers to obtaining and using PrEP. To our knowledge, no known patient navigation programs for PrEP have been developed for Latino MSM. The objectives of this proposed study are to develop, pretest, produce, and pilot test a patient navigation intervention designed to address multiple components of the PrEP cascade among Latino MSM between the age of 18 and 29. During Phase 1, qualitative data will be collected through 30 in-depth interviews to assess needs and assets of young adult Latino MSM regarding engagement and retention in the PrEP cascade. From these findings, health care provider and staff feedback, and through the guidance of a Participatory Planning Group, a patient navigation intervention will be developed and pre-tested through 25 in-depth interviews. During Phase 2, the patient navigation intervention will be pilot-tested with 60 young adult Latino MSM. The patient navigation intervention will be compared to usual care plus written information to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and study methods, as well as the intervention's potential in improving engagement and retention in PrEP-related care. The project will investigate the following specific aims: 1) to assess the needs and assets of young adult Latino MSM regarding engagement and retention in the PrEP cascade; 2) to develop, pretest, and produce a patient navigation intervention designed to facilitate engagement and retention in the PrEP cascade among young adult Latino MSM; and 3) to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of the patient navigation intervention by comparing it to usual care to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact. The proposed study has significant public health implications and is expected to contribute to efforts to reduce HIV-related disparities and increase adherence to PrEP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Young adult Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk of contract human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). No known patient navigation interventions have been systematically designed or evaluate to assist any individual with accessing HIV Pre-Exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)-related care or adhering to PrEP.

"Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program ""PREP@UAZ"" Program Summary/Abstract American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) are the most underrepresented racial/ethnic group among scientists in the U.S. One reason for their low representation is the cultural difference between Indigenous and Euro-American-based science, which can lead to a feeling of isolation for AI/AN students. The vision of Indigenous1 scholars within higher education and the long-term goal of the proposed University of Arizona Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (UA PREP) is to overcome these differences and increase the participation of AI/AN students in biomedical research. Due to its close proximity to many Tribal or AI/AN communities, the richness of its biomedical and behavioral research enterprise, and an institutional-level commitment to diversity and inclusion, UA is well-positioned for a PREP program. Further, UA ranks first among U.S. research-intensive universities in conferring PhD degrees to AI/AN students. The premise of the proposed PREP is that nurturing overall well-being and honoring Indigenous science knowledge while offering AI/AN students a doctoral-level research experience will provide the best foundation for success in graduate school. The current proposal seeks to provide five to eight UA PREP participants per year with an intensive research experience and additional training to enhance their competitiveness for doctoral programs. Strategic partnerships with minority-serving institutions and with programs at UA that support AI/AN undergraduates in STEM fields will be utilized to support recruitment efforts. The program will focus on students who have encountered greater than average challenges on their path to graduate school. Participants will spend 75% of their time conducting hypothesis-driven, doctoral-level research. The proposed activities for the remaining 25% of the participants' efforts will provide career development training. The matriculation and retention of AI/AN students in graduate programs will be increased by nurturing a sense of belonging within the community of science while honoring Indigenous knowledge. We aim to have at least 75% of the trainees matriculate into biomedical PhD programs. Their retention and success in these programs will be enhanced by foundations laid in UA PREP. Participants will be encouraged to incorporate their cultural values into their individual development plans. Further, program activities will nurture community engagement with frequent opportunities to interact with Native and non-Native science faculty and graduate students. The capacity of UA to train AI/AN graduate students will be fostered through annual workshops aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of faculty in mentoring students and increasing cultural sensitivity and awareness of and integration of Indigenous science methods into the curriculum. A selection committee of research-active mentors will recommend the strongest applicants to UA PREP for approval by the Institutional Advisory Committee. This committee and an expert external evaluator will regularly assess progress towards the UA PREP program objectives. 1Indigenous and Native American are used here, respectively, for Indigenous groups internationally and in the U.S. 1 Project Narrative American Indians/Alaskan Natives (AI/AN) are the most underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities in the biomedical sciences. The University of Arizona Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (UA PREP) seeks to provide AI/AN students with a rigorous research and educational program that honors Indigenous perspectives and nurtures a strong sense of well-being and belonging. This program will enhance the confidence and success of participants and their matriculation into strong biomedical PhD programs and subsequently increase the diversity of PhD-level scientists.","Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program ""PREP@UAZ""",9636577,R25GM121228,"['Affect ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Arizona ', ' Awareness ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Colorado ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Montana ', ' New Mexico ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Reflex ', ' Reflex action ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Trainers Training ', ' Vocation ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' career ', ' role model ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Native Americans ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' System ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' graduate student ', ' cultural values ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' career development ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Indigenous ', ' International ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' NIGMS ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' minority institution ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' STEM field ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics major ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics field ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics course ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics class ', ' science, technology, engineering and math major ', ' science, technology, engineering and math field ', ' science, technology, engineering and math discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and math course ', ' science, technology, engineering and math class ', ' STEM major ', ' STEM discipline ', ' STEM course ', ' STEM class ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' Critical Thinking ', ' Evaluative Thinking ', ' Complex thinking ', ' student mentoring ', ' student-led learning ', ' faculty research ', ' peer coaching ', ' peer teaching ', ' peer mentoring ', ' peer led team learning ', ' peer instruction ', ' higher education ', ' matriculation ', ' education research ', ' Cultural Sensitivity ', ' Student recruitment ', ' non-Native ', ' nonnative ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R25,2019,237983,0.2805779903306428
"Longitudinal Predictors of PrEP Use and Adherence Among Young Black MSM Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) dramatically reduces the risk of HIV infection, especially for those who are most adherent. However, for PrEP to significantly impact the HIV epidemic, those most at risk of HIV must both use and adhere to PrEP. Data suggest that a substantial proportion of men who have sex with men (MSM) stop using PrEP soon after starting; they may or may not resume use. There is also evidence that many young men may not consistently adhere to PrEP. However, we know very little about the frequency of PrEP termination, gaps in PrEP use, or lapses in prevention-effective adherence among young Black MSM (YBMSM), or about short- and long-term changes in use and adherence for these men. Additionally, we lack information about how use and adherence among YBMSM may be impacted by structural and psychosocial barriers to PrEP (including issues with health care access and insurance; low socioeconomic status and instability in employment, transportation, and housing; poor mental health; substance use; and stigma and negative social norms related to PrEP) or partner and relationship factors (such as the introduction of new partners, the development of committed relationships, perceptions of partner risk, and intimate partner violence). The overall aim of the proposed research is to use short- and long-term prospective, longitudinal data from YBMSM PrEP users to examine patterns and predictors of PrEP use and adherence, with the goal of identifying targets for PrEP interventions with this high-risk population. We will recruit 200 YBMSM (ages 18- 30) who use PrEP from Midwestern metro areas with large racial disparities in HIV (Detroit, MI; Kansas City, MO; Milwaukee, WI; and Minneapolis, MN). Men will complete surveys assessing PrEP use and adherence along with hypothesized predictors every 3 months for 1 year. Additionally, a subsample of 100 users will complete 14 days of electronic daily diaries to assess micro changes in adherence, other sexual health and risk behaviors, and key predictors. Dried blood spot tests for tenofovir will be used to objectively assess adherence, and information on HIV and STI testing and infection will be drawn from linked medical records. Through the application of modern analytic methods, this research will address the following aims: (1) Describe longitudinal changes in PrEP use and adherence among YBMSM, and associations between PrEP use and adherence and other sexual health and risk behaviors and outcomes; (2) Identify factors associated with gaps in PrEP use, PrEP termination, and poor PrEP adherence for YBMSM over 1 year; and (3) Identify factors associated with PrEP adherence at the daily level for YBMSM using daily diary surveys. We predict that gaps in PrEP use, PrEP termination, and lapses in prevention-effective adherence will be common, and that they will be associated with structural and psychosocial barriers as well as sexual partner and relationship factors. Information on how and why use and adherence vary over time will inform the development of interventions targeting PrEP uptake and adherence among YBMSM. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) dramatically reduces the risk of HIV infection, especially for those who are most adherent. However, there is evidence that a substantial proportion of men who have sex with men (MSM) stop using PrEP soon after starting, and that many users, especially young Black MSM, may not take PrEP consistently. This research will collect longitudinal survey and daily diary data from young Black MSM who use PrEP in four mid-sized Midwestern cities with large HIV disparities in order to identify changes in PrEP use and adherence over time; barriers and sexual partner factors associated with gaps in PrEP use, PrEP termination, and poor PrEP adherence; and predictors of PrEP adherence at the daily level.

"Advancing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) access in pharmacies to improve PrEP uptake in disadvantaged areas Abstract Optimizing the reach of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) access for black men who have sex with men (BMSM) is critical to reduce racial inequities in HIV. The overall objective of this R34 application is to develop a culturally appropriate pharmacy PrEP delivery model and examine its feasibility, acceptability, and safety for BMSM who live in high poverty, racial minority neighborhoods. Cohen’s structural theory supports our central hypothesis that increased availability of PrEP screening and prescribing in neighborhoods where BMSM are most impacted by HIV will facilitate PrEP uptake. Findings from the proposed pilot study will support the long- term goal of this program of research, which is to implement an R01 cluster randomized efficacy trial in high poverty, racial minority neighborhoods to increase PrEP uptake among BMSM and reduce racial inequities in HIV. The aims of this R34 feasibility study are to: Aim 1) develop a pharmacy PrEP delivery model by evaluating the barriers to and facilitators of integrating PrEP into existing pharmacy practice among 40 key stakeholders (pharmacists, technicians, PrEP-prescribing physicians and BMSM) and Aim 2) pilot test the pharmacy PrEP delivery model and examine its feasibility, acceptability and safety, and gather early evidence of its impact and cost with respect to PrEP uptake at baseline and in 3-months among BMSM. To accomplish these aims we will conduct a formative phase of in-depth interviews among key stakeholders to inform the intervention development phase, which will establish a pharmacy PrEP delivery model with formalized input from an existing advisory board to be implemented in the pilot study phase among 2 community pharmacies, where we have existing relationships. Pharmacists (n=2) and technicians (n=6) will be trained using an adapted continuing education certified in-pharmacy HIV prevention training. They will complete semi-structured surveys over time (baseline, 3-month and 6-month) to assess the impact of the pharmacy PrEP intervention on pharmacy environment, personnel, and business flow. Social, behavioral surveys will be completed by 60 BMSM. We will follow behaviorally eligible BMSM, who complete their own biological screening in the pharmacy and receive PrEP (n=20) to determine PrEP uptake at 3-months. Development and refinement of this pharmacy PrEP delivery model is significant because it will lay the foundation for pharmacy-based PrEP access that reaches populations historically disconnected from HIV prevention resources. The innovation of this studies lies in its ability to shift the current paradigm of PrEP service delivery for BMSM by 1) creating a model that is achievable for most pharmacists even if they have limited pharmacy-level resources to screen men for PrEP, 2) employing a multi-level approach that examines the impact of the intervention on pharmacy staff and BMSM and 3) testing the use of self-screening in the pharmacy setting.

"Developing a PrEP Adherence Intervention Targeting At-Risk and Substance Using Women Project Summary We aim to develop and assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy on adherence of a community-informed tenofovir/emticitrabine (TDF/FTC) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) engagement intervention among street-based female sex workers (FSWs) in Baltimore, Maryland. PrEP is a potentially empowering method of HIV protection that is safe and effective, however, there is little research to inform PrEP targeting and use among FSWs. The CDC Clinical Guidelines indicate PrEP for women engaged in sex work. Through a community participatory process, we propose developing a small group, mHealth-enhanced peer- navigator intervention, STAR-PrEP (Sex workers Take Action and Responsibility), aimed raise PrEP awareness among FSWs and to to enhance PrEP uptake and adherence. The study is informed by psychological empowerment and fundamental cause theories. The study aims to: 1). employ community engaged research activities (e.g., community forums, focus groups, component testing, in-depth interviews) to identify FSW-specific barriers to PrEP engagement and to develop a small group and mHealth enhanced SW- PrEP intervention to promote PrEP uptake and adherence among street-based HIV-negative FSWs (N=40) in Baltimore Maryland; 2) assess the STAR-PrEP’s acceptability (e.g., refusal rates, intervention engagement) and feasibility (e.g., recruitment, retention) among intervention participants (n=40), and preliminary efficacy on PrEP uptake and adherence in intervention versus comparison participants (n=40) among street-based FSWs in Baltimore, Maryland at 6-month follow-up; 2a) to explore the role of empowerment (e.g. perceived stigma, social support) and structural vulnerability (e.g., access to care) factors as correlates or possible mediators of the intervention effect on study outcomes in intervention (n=40) versus comparison participants (n=40) at 6-month follow-up; and 3) to explore predictors (i.e., homelessness, depression, drug use) of STAR- PrEP participants on monthly drug adherence among street-based FSWs (N=40) in Baltimore, Maryland at the 6-month follow up. Drug adherence will be detected by 6-monthly plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells tests. The proposal is directly responsive to RFA-MH-17-361 and addresses 3 NIH HIV/AIDS Research Priorities: 1) reducing “incidence in HIV/AIDS” among a high risk yet understudied population; 2) reducing health disparities among socially and economically marginalized group of women who are largely African American; and 3) training peer navigators to increase a “workforce to conduct high priority HIV/AIDS research."" The proposed intervention is one of the first to focus on this high-risk yet understudied population in the U.S., and is strengthened by its partnership with longstanding community healthcare providers to prescribe PrEP. Data will inform the design, recruitment, and effect size of a future R01 focused on a larger trial targeting street-based FSWs and PrEP providers. Project Relevance The proposed study will inform the development of a multifaceted PrEP adherence intervention targeting street-based female sex workers (FSWs) in Baltimore, Maryland. The study will include an extensive community engaged research activities co-led by a FSW Community Advisory Board, including FSW community forums focus groups, component testing, and in-depth interviews with community-based PrEP providers. This process will result in the development of a small group, mHealth-enhanced peer-navigator intervention, STAR-PrEP (Sex workers Take Action and Responsibility). The intervention aims to enhance PrEP awareness among FSWs as well as increase PrEP uptake and adherence among the intervention (n=40) compared to the comparison (n=40) participants, while adherence will be detected among intervention participants t detected by 6-monthly plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) tests.",Developing a PrEP Adherence Intervention Targeting At-Risk and Substance Using Women,9717214,R34DA045619,"['Awareness ', ' Baltimore ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Community Workers ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Maryland ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Homelessness ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Individual ', ' Research Activity ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' uptake ', ' Review Literature ', ' Nature ', ' Research Priority ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Pattern ', ' Outcome Study ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' PBMC ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' empowerment ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' informant ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' arm ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' navigator intervention ', ' female sex worker ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' recruit ', ' intervention participants ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R34,2019,245625,0.3409618744492109
"Novel mHealth Technologies to Enhance PrEP Adherence among Thai YMSM:  Collaborative Adaption and Evaluation ABSTRACT In Thailand, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) account for 41% of new HIV infections with an increasing trend in infections over time. Young MSM (YMSM) are at a significantly greater risk of HIV infection than older MSM with YMSM, ages 15-21, experiencing a 12.1% rate of new HIV infections. There is an urgent need to implement novel behavioral and biomedical interventions for YMSM in Thailand that are culturally and developmentally appropriate, engaging for youth, and scalable. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) provides a strong preventative benefit to youth at-risk for HIV infection and there is overwhelming evidence supporting its efficacy. While daily, oral PrEP adherence is highly correlated with its efficacy in clinical trials, adherence rates are variable. In real-world practice settings, PrEP adherence has been found to be lower among youth. Given that YMSM are disproportionately affected by HIV in Thailand, interventions are needed that improve adherence to oral PrEP among this population, thereby maximizing its preventative benefits. To address this need, we propose a collaboration between Duke University, the Thai Red Cross- AIDS Research Centre (TRCARC) and the University of North Carolina- Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). The research team will adapt a theory-based smartphone app to improve PrEP adherence among YMSM in Thailand and conduct a pilot study to assess study feasibility, acceptability, and potential impact. The adapted smartphone app, CHARGE, will utilize social networking and game-based mechanics as well as evidenced-based features to improve PrEP adherence among Thai YMSM, 16-24. In order to adapt the app, we will conduct formative research in Thailand including focus group and Youth Advisory Board discussions with YMSM and interviews with key informants who provide services to YMSM to ensure the app addresses individual, contextual, and cultural factors related to PrEP adherence. Usability testing will assess users’ comprehension of the educational content, understanding and use of intervention features, and overall impressions of app relevance and appeal. After any needed app revisions, a 6-month pilot study will be conducted with 60 YMSM initiating PrEP. Participants will be randomized into the CHARGE intervention arm or PrEP standard of care consistent with TRCARC guidelines. The primary outcomes will include study feasibility and acceptability. The secondary outcomes will include PrEP adherence as measured by intracellular levels of tenofovir-diphosphate and emtricitabine triphosphate from dried blood spots. Built on a successful, evidence-based platform designed by our collaborating technology partner, Ayogo, and tested by the study team, CHARGE will be flexible and responsive to changes in technology and changes in PrEP practice standards and guideline recommendations. We have proposed a strong research capacity building plan that will enhance the scientific and technological capabilities of TRCARC and other community based organizations in Thailand to develop, implement, and evaluate mHealth interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) represents a promising strategy for reducing HIV infections among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) in Thailand; however, PrEP efficacy is highly correlated with adherence and adherence among young populations is low. There are currently no proven interventions to promote PrEP adherence among YMSM specifically designed for the Thai context. We will adapt a novel mobile phone application (app) platform that utilizes game mechanics and social networking features to improve PrEP adherence for Thai YMSM and conduct a pilot study to test its feasibility, acceptability, and potential impact.",Novel mHealth Technologies to Enhance PrEP Adherence among Thai YMSM:  Collaborative Adaption and Evaluation,9742568,R21TW010965,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Attention ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Boredom ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Environment ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' Immersion ', ' Immersion Investigative Technique ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' North Carolina ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Pyrophosphates ', ' Diphosphates ', ' Recommendation ', ' Red Cross ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Thailand ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' triphosphate ', ' tripolyphosphate ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Social Network ', ' Comprehension ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Bisexual ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Gays ', ' Collaborations ', ' Spottings ', ' Mechanics ', ' mechanical ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Oral ', ' Source ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' impression ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Health Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Modeling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' emtricitabine ', "" beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine "", ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' trend ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' older men ', ' usability ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' LMIC ', ' social engagement ', ' social participation ', ' social involvement ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' practice setting ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' adherence rate ', ' ']",FIC,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,182102,0.29714454003375
"The Southern Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Cohort Study: Longitudinal PrEP Initiation and Adherence among Parolees PROJECT ABSTRACT The estimated HIV prevalence among criminal justice (CJ) involved individuals is three times higher than the general population. Parolees on post-release supervision after release experience multi-level obstacles (e.g., lack of access to housing, employment) that act as barriers to HIV prevention efforts, making existing approaches to HIV prevention insufficient for reducing HIV incidence. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a once daily medication (emtricitabine/tenofovir, FTC/TDF) that has demonstrated efficacy in preventing HIV among at-risk groups. Little is known about PrEP knowledge, acceptability, initiation, and sustained use among parolees recently released from prison or how these patterns vary by individual (HIV risk factor, sociodemographic characteristics), social (stigma, social support), and structural (housing, employment) factors. Therefore, we propose to conduct an observational, multi-site cohort study in North Carolina, Kentucky, and Florida—the Southern Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis [PrEP] Cohort Study among Parolees (SPECS-P). This study is guided by the Social Ecological Model and the NIMHD Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework, which both have a focus extending beyond the individual and acknowledge that multi-level (individual, social, and structural) factors play a role in the perpetuation of persistent health disparities. The specific aims of the proposed study are: 1) characterize PrEP knowledge and acceptability among parolees; 2) identify the multi-level factors that predict PrEP initiation and sustained use among parolees; 3) qualitatively assess the multi-level factors that affect PrEP acceptability, initiation and sustained use to inform future intervention development. The proposed project will be the first observational cohort study that includes a CJ involved population at extreme risk for HIV acquisition. Our study is aligned with the following high priority topics as defined by the NIH, NIMHD Science Visioning, and Office of AIDS Research: a) advancing evaluation of approaches to improve minority health or to reduce health disparities; and b) reducing incidence of HIV/AIDS and implementing strategies to improve entry into prevention services.

"PrEP Up!: Understanding PrEP stigma to improve uptake among men who have sex with men Project Summary/Abstract Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV in Guatemala. While national level adult HIV prevalence is less than 1.0%, the most recent prevalence estimate among MSM is 10.5%. This dramatic HIV disparity suggests that current prevention strategies are not sufficient. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) with daily tenofovir/emtricitabine safely provides high levels of protection against HIV infection if taken correctly and has expanded the HIV prevention landscape. Global PrEP uptake has been slower than expected, however, and PrEP acceptability among men who have sex with men (MSM) is only 58%1. Promoting PrEP requires innovative, tailored approaches grounded in contextualized understanding of the social context and lived experiences of potential users1,2. Among MSM, multiple levels of intersecting stigma related to HIV and sexual orientation can deter PrEP initiation1–14. PrEP stigma, which includes negative stereotypes of PrEP users as having HIV and/or being irresponsible and promiscuous, also greatly inhibits PrEP acceptability and uptake11,13–24. More research on levels and manifestations of PrEP stigma are needed to inform global PrEP promotion efforts. Mobile Health (mHealth) interventions, in particular smartphone applications (apps), can be used to mitigate stigma. The accessibility, affordability, flexibility, and anonymity of smartphones make them a highly appealing medium for engaging MSM and addressing PrEP stigma. Further, smartphone interventions address issues such as transportation logistics, stigma, and confidentiality, all of which are barriers to sexual health services among MSM in Guatemala6–9. While still a nascent field, early evidence, including work by our team, suggests that smartphone apps can address stigma as a barrier to health promotion among MSM by providing information and cultivating social support25–30. Our community research partner, Colectivo Amigos Contra el SIDA (CAS), opened the first community-based PrEP clinic in Latin America in January 2016 and is now planning to scale up coverage. This scale up creates a crucial need for information on barriers to PrEP acceptability and uptake and a unique opportunity to explore PrEP stigma in the lives of MSM. The proposed R21 aims to assess the role of stigma in PrEP acceptability to inform the design of mHealth PrEP promotion strategies through a bidirectional process of research capacity building with UNC and CAS. In Aim 1, we will determine the association between PrEP stigma and PrEP acceptability among MSM using a mixed methods approach. We will conduct qualitative in-depth interviews (n=20) and a structured survey (n=200) to obtain multiple perspectives on PreP acceptability, PrEP stigma, and smartphone use and preferences. For Aim 2, we will assess how MSM in Guatemala interact in online discussions and exchange social support related to PrEP through online focus groups discussions. For Aim 3, we will evaluate strategies to promote uptake of and engagement with a smartphone app for PrEP uptake. In these discussions we will assess optimal channels and messaging for app dissemination and components within the app to promote engagement. Project Narrative This study will provide in-depth understanding of how stigma impacts acceptability and uptake of PrEP among men who have sex with men in Guatemala. Findings will inform development of a smartphone app to reduce stigma and increase access to PrEP that will be transferable throughout Central America and globally.",PrEP Up!: Understanding PrEP stigma to improve uptake among men who have sex with men,9754300,R21TW011264,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Awareness ', ' Brazil ', ' Central America ', ' Cities ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Ecuador ', ' Faculty ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Guatemala ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Interview ', ' Latin America ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Peru ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Logistics ', ' uptake ', ' Knowledge ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Applied Research ', ' Applied Science ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' emtricitabine ', "" beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine "", ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' scale up ', ' cost effective ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' control trial ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' personalized approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' Latin American ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' recruit ', ' smartphone Application ', ' iPhone Application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iOS application ', ' iOS app ', ' Smartphone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Android Application ', ' Android App ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' ']",FIC,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2019,183874,0.327833180866423
"The Effect of Intersecting Stigmas on PrEP Outcomes for Young Black MSM Abstract Despite recent progress, Black Americans continue to bear the most severe burden of HIV/AIDS in the nation, and young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) continue to be most affected. Antiretroviral pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been endorsed as a potentially effective part of HIV combination prevention strategies and an opportunity to reduce new infections among YBMSM. However, without significant efforts to develop age and culturally-tailored PrEP interventions for YBMSM, PrEP use may only be accessible and utilized by older, White, more affluent MSM, further exacerbating HIV disparities. Through the framework of intersectionality, the proposed research examines how various, intersectional stigmas may limit YBMSM’s ability and willingness to use PrEP. Various stigmas experienced by Black MSM (homonegativity, racism) are associated with adverse outcomes along the HIV care continuum and there is reason to believe these stigmas may also negatively affect PrEP outcomes. The proposed study aims to address the current lack of research on YBMSM’s barriers to using PrEP and gather the data necessary to inform a tailored intervention for YBMSM. The study will take place in Milwaukee, WI. In phase I, we will conduct 9 focus groups (n=72-90) with YBMSM ages 16-25 to explore YBMSM’s knowledge and perceptions of PrEP, identify individual, community and structural level factors likely to affect PrEP uptake among YBMSM, and examine YBMSM’s general healthcare utilization patterns and barriers. Additionally, we will employ a quantitative study to examine the relationship between various stigmas (racism, medical mistrust, homonegativity) and examine the effects of intersecting stigmas on knowledge and acceptance of PrEP among 300 YBMSM. We hypothesize that racism, homonegativity, and the intersection of those stigmas will predict lower knowledge of PrEP, reduced likelihood of using PrEP, and greater PrEP stigma. We also hypothesize that the relationships between various stigmas and PrEP outcomes will be moderated by resiliency and social support. In Phase II, we will use findings from Phase I and community-based participatory research methods to develop an evidence-based multi-level intervention tailored to YBMSM to be tested in a future R34. Findings from this study may not only be useful in increasing PrEP use among YBMSM, but may also be generalized to other outcomes along the care continuum. The training plan in this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) application will provide the training and research experience necessary to support Dr. Katherine Quinn’s transition to an independent HIV prevention and intervention researcher. Training includes four primary goals: build content expertise in intersectional stigma, develop mastery of complex statistical modeling for intersectionality and mixed-methods research, build expertise in intervention science, and enhance career and professional development. The training acquired by Dr. Quinn includes didactic coursework, academic conferences, manuscript preparation, independent study, grant writing workshops and other research activities. Project Narrative Young, black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may be an essential part of combination prevention strategies to curb these disparities. Stigma may be a limiting factor in the success of PrEP for YBMSM and this research will examine how intersectional stigma experienced by YBMSM may influence PrEP knowledge and uptake.

"Improving Prevention Systems to Reduce Disparities for High Priority Populations. 7. PROJECT SUMMARY This project collaborates with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) to develop and test a field-based comprehensive sexual health intervention for HIV-exposed contacts notified by its Partner Services (i.e., HIV contact tracing) program. Individuals reached by PS programs are highest priority for linkage to HIV prevention/care services: 10-20% are newly diagnosed with HIV as a result of PS notification and the remainder are eligible and high priority for PrEP. Because they seek out highest-risk individuals in the field, PS programs have the potential to significantly reduce existing disparities in PrEP uptake and timely HIV care initiation by reaching populations that are currently under-engaged by traditional PrEP or HIV testing programs. The new Partner Services-Sexual Health (PS-SH) intervention offers a comprehensive sexual health package that includes HIV testing, STI testing, ARV/PrEP education and immediate medication start to all individuals receiving contact notification (i.e., being notified of a recent exposure to HIV). NYCDOHMH is collaborating on this research project to enable a scientifically rigorous test of the intervention’s efficacy and produce the highest quality data on implementation dynamics, cost-effectiveness, and affordability to inform dissemination and adaptation of the intervention, should it prove effective. The specific aims are to: (1) Pilot and refine a field-based comprehensive sexual health intervention delivered through the NYC DOHMH Partner Services Program. Under this aim, we will pilot the intervention in five highest prevalence NYC neighborhoods for 6-months (n = ~60), examine feasibility and acceptability, and refine the intervention process and protocols for the trial to test effectiveness at scale. (2) Examine the effectiveness of the Partner Services-Sexual Health (PS-SH) intervention in improving rates of HIV testing, linkage to HIV prevention/care, and PrEP uptake among highest risk contacts recently exposed to HIV. Under this aim, we will conduct a cross-sectional stepped wedge cluster randomized trial in which 12 clusters of NYC neighborhoods are exposed to the intervention sequentially, with three clusters moving from control to intervention every 6 months (n = 1150). Primary outcomes are HIV testing, timely PrEP/ARV uptake, and linkage to PrEP/HIV care. Secondary outcomes are STD testing and receipt of STD treatment (if indicated). (3) Conduct preliminary analyses of economic outcomes, including cost-allocation and affordability to allow other jurisdictions to make decisions about implementation. These analyses will include per-outcome cost-estimates, and will develop a blueprint for economic evaluation of the intervention including incremental cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses for application locally and nationally. The proposed project is poised to have a significant and sustained impact on the field by: a) addressing a critical gap in the prevention/care continuum to reduce persistent disparities in the epidemic; and b) pioneering a collaborative implementation science approach to accelerate the dissemination of evidence-based practice models across the United States and internationally. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe disparities in PrEP access and uptake remain among populations most strongly impacted by the HIV epidemic. These same populations suffer from disproportionately high rates of undiagnosed infection and late treatment initiation that translate into high levels of HIV-related mobility and mortality. This implementation science project partners with a public health department to pioneer and rigorously test an innovative method for reaching highest risk populations and engaging them in HIV testing, PrEP, and/or ARV treatment to significantly positively impact the epidemic.",Improving Prevention Systems to Reduce Disparities for High Priority Populations.,9692054,R01MH115835,"['Appointment ', ' Budgets ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Cost Apportionment ', ' Cost Allocation ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Decision Making ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Epidemic ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Infection ', ' Insurance ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Infectious Disease Contact Tracing ', ' Communicable Disease Contact Tracing ', ' Contact Tracing ', ' economic evaluation ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Data Quality ', ' uptake ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Notification ', ' Oral ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' care seeking ', ' Prevention ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Collection ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' economic outcome ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' sexual health intervention ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' incremental cost-effectiveness ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' service programs ', ' Service delivery model ', ' healthcare delivery model ', ' health care delivery model ', ' care delivery model ', ' Service model ', ' cost outcomes ', ' ']",NIMH,HUNTER COLLEGE,R01,2019,605553,0.21562308974488295
"Theoretically Based Mobile App to Increase PrEP Uptake Among MSM Abstract Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) holds great promise to reduce susceptibility to HIV infection for those who are HIV-negative and take PrEP regularly. However, PrEP initiation is serostatus dependent, and starting PrEP when risk emerges requires men who have sex with men (MSM) to maintain regular HIV testing routines and regularly assess PrEP eligibility. Currently many MSM do not test for HIV regularly, and PrEP uptake has been slow. PrEP will not have sufficient impact on HIV incidence among MSM unless it is brought to scale; PrEP coverage of 40-50% would be required to reduce HIV incidence by 25%. Today, PrEP uptake among MSM stands at 8.5%. We propose to test the efficacy of a mobile app (HealthMindr) to promote PrEP uptake in 3 US cities with substantial HIV epidemics among MSM: Atlanta, GA, Jackson, MS, and Washington, DC. The prevention app has already been developed and tested with 121 MSM; 9% of PrEP eligible MSM who used the app initiated PrEP during a 4-month follow-up period. Further, the app was found to be very acceptable to MSM. Minor enhancements to the PrEP component of the app will be made, including addition of additional PrEP information. The app will include components for self-administered risk assessments, developing and supporting a plan for frequent HIV testing, and monthly self-assessment for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) eligibility. The app will link those eligible for PrEP to services with a locator for PrEP providers, including private providers and details about services available, and with public PrEP navigators. The app will be tested in an RCT versus standard of care (referral to existing PrEP information and resources) in the three cities. The primary outcome will be rate of PrEP initiation, confirmed by tenofovir-diphosphate detection in a dried blood spot (DBS) specimen and/or photographic evidence of PrEP prescription. Project narrative A key issue for advancing comprehensive HIV prevention for MSM is how to increase PrEP uptake while sustaining high levels of HIV testing and condom use. We propose to evaluate the efficacy of a mobile application, HealthMindr, to increase PrEP uptake in the context of a package of basic prevention services for men who have sex with men in 3 US cities: Atlanta, GA, Jackson, MS, and Washington, DC.",Theoretically Based Mobile App to Increase PrEP Uptake Among MSM,9763535,R01DA045612,"['Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cities ', ' Counseling ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Minor ', ' Study models ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Privatization ', ' Pyrophosphates ', ' Diphosphates ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Self Administration ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Suggestion ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Washington ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' uptake ', ' Spottings ', ' tool ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Viread ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' condoms ', ' prevention service ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' pill ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Detection ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' active control ', ' Prevention Services Research ', ' cost ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk men ', ' men at high risk ', ' usability ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' efficacy testing ', ' surveillance study ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' ']",NIDA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,1050472,0.3756237476509248
"Multilevel determinants of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) utilization and health disparities among Black and Hispanic women Women constitute a substantial proportion (20%) of new HIV diagnoses in the U.S., with the majority of infections occurring in women of color: Black and Latina women together account for 77% of newly diagnosed women nationally but represent 30% of the female population. Gender-based social inequalities combined with men’s control over HIV prevention methods, such as condoms and viral suppression, have traditionally limited women’s options with regard to self-protective risk behavior. HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken as a once-daily pill (Truvada) represents an historic breakthrough in HIV prevention for women, as it is the first commercially available effective method that is independent of the sexual act and can be controlled by women. Yet, only about 4% of women who are at high risk of HIV are taking the drug. Moreover, despite being at greatest risk for HIV Black and Latina women are the least likely to take PrEP. Women of color thus confront dual HIV-related health disparities: they have disproportionately high rates of HIV infection but disproportionately low rates of PrEP use for HIV prevention. The reasons for the low PrEP use among Black and Latina women are not well-understood. To address this gap, we propose a mixed methods longitudinal cohort study with the following specific aims: (1) characterize the PrEP care continuum (PrEP-CC; awareness, linkage, uptake, retention and adherence) among women at high risk for HIV, including health disparities; (2) identify determinants at multiple levels (societal, healthcare setting, community, interpersonal, individual) associated with PrEP-CC outcomes, including health disparities; (3) determine which healthcare provision strategies and programs promote improvement of PrEP-CC outcomes for women; and (4) explore providers’ attitudes, perspectives, practices, and environments that shape PrEP provision behavior and patient interactions. A conceptual framework integrating socioecological theory with the Gelberg-Andersen behavioral model and the Theory of Gender and Power will guide this work. The study will be conducted in two cities in New York State: New York City and Rochester. New York State has the second largest racial health disparity in HIV in the nation. A cohort (N=360) of women (80% minority) who are either taking PrEP or eligible for PrEP will be enrolled and assessed quarterly for 12 months to obtain survey, biometric, and medical record data. Sampling and recruitment strategies will involve respondent driven sampling methods in combination with time-location sampling. Community-level socioeconomic data and healthcare site- level data will also be obtained. Analyses of quantitative data will estimate within- and between-subject effects of multilevel predictors on PrEP-CC outcomes. Time-to-event analysis will also be employed to model stages along the PrEP-CC. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with a subsample of 50 women (stratified by PrEP use and race/ethnicity), and 18 clinical providers to provide contextual data for triangulation. Findings from this study will provide an evidence-base upon which to develop and evaluate interventions, programs and services for women of color to address HIV and PrEP outcomes and health disparities. Public Health Relevance: The use of antiretroviral medication—brand name Truvada—for the prevention of HIV (pre-exposure prophylaxis; PrEP) among Black and Latina women in the U.S. has the potential to significantly reduce disproportionately high rates of HIV in these groups. However, adoption of PrEP by women of color has been very limited, thereby reducing the public health benefit of PrEP to address racial and ethnic disparities in HIV transmission among women. The proposed study is designed to provide a knowledge base regarding key obstacles and facilitators of PrEP utilization that can be applied to develop effective PrEP interventions and delivery models for Black and Latina women.",Multilevel determinants of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) utilization and health disparities among Black and Hispanic women,9899756,R01MD013553,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Cities ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Decision Making ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Physician Executives ', ' Medical Directors ', ' Medical Records ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"A Structural Approach to Improving HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Implementation among High Risk Men PROJECT SUMMARY  Dr. Raifman’s long-term career development goal is to become an independent researcher working to reduce sexual minority health disparities with a focus on reducing the burden of HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM). MSM in the United States have a lifetime risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) nearly 80 times that of men who have sex with women, but just 4% reported using pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV in 2014. Structural stigma based on sexual orientation may contribute to slow PrEP uptake. Dr. Raifman will evaluate the role of structural stigma in MSM PrEP awareness and uptake and will develop and refine a clinic-level intervention to reduce structural stigma and improve PrEP uptake. She has the following research aims: (1) Assess state-level structural stigma and PrEP awareness and uptake among MSM through a difference-in-differences analysis; (2) Assess the relationship between sexual minority stigma in healthcare settings and PrEP awareness and uptake, and whether stigma in healthcare setting mediates any relationship between state-level stigma and PrEP awareness and uptake; and (3) Develop and refine a PrEP and structural stigma intervention for primary care settings. Dr. Raifman will use Centers for Disease Control and Prevention repeated cross-sectional National HIV Behavioral Surveillance Data collected from MSM in 21 cities and national Internet survey data from MSM collected by Fenway Health in 2013. She will also conduct qualitative interviews with clinic administrators, primary care providers, and MSM patients in Massachusetts and Georgia, states with differing levels of disparities in MSM health.  The proposed research builds upon Dr. Raifman’s prior research on the health effects of structural stigma affecting sexual minorities, on HIV prevention and PrEP implementation, and on HIV treatment and care. She will pursue the following K01 training aims to prepare her for the proposed research and for her career goals: (1) Acquire training on health and social policymaking in the US; (2) Acquire high-level training in statistical methods for causal mediation analysis to evaluate different levels of stigma; (3) Acquire training on developing and evaluating multi-component, clinical interventions; and (4) Acquire training in health informatics in order to integrate interventions into electronic medical records. To achieve these training goals, Dr. Raifman has assembled a mentorship team lead by Dr. Michael Stein, the chair of Health Law, Policy, and Management at Boston University School of Public Health (BUSPH); Dr. Kenneth Mayer, Medical Director of Fenway Health; Dr. Colleen Barry, the Julie and Fred Soper Professor and Chair of Health Policy and Management at Johns Hopkins; and Dr. Debbie Cheng, BUSPH Professor of Biostatistics.

"Increasing PrEP Use in High-Risk Social Networks of African American MSM in Underserved Low-Uptake Cities Abstract  PrEP is a powerful and potentially groundbreaking HIV prevention strategy, but its public health impact will depend on widescale adoption by persons at greatest risk for contracting HIV infection. PrEP awareness and use remain especially low among African American MSM in mid-sized cities across the center of the country, and very little research has tested interventions that can increase PrEP awareness, benefit perception, and normative support—and decrease PrEP stigma and concerns—among African American MSM in these cities. PrEP can achieve its full public health potential only when its uptake among racial minority MSM in neglected mid-sized American cities is increased. In prior research, our team established that network-level interventions can reach and be used to deliver effective HIV risk reduction interventions to Black MSM in the industrial Midwest, including hard-to-reach men hidden in the community. The planned mixed- methods research will now evaluate a network intervention to increase PrEP uptake among high-risk African American MSM in Milwaukee and Cleveland, cities where HIV racial disparities are profound but PrEP use is low. In a formative research phase, in-depth interviews will be conducted with African American MSM, PrEP providers, and other key informants in each city to identify understandings, concerns, barriers, and facilitators of PrEP use. In the main intervention trial phase, 36 social networks of high-risk racial minority MSM (expected n=504 participants) will be enrolled, 18 networks per city, by recruiting high-risk initial “seeds,” members of each seed's MSM friendship network, and then two outward successive rings of their friends. All study participants will receive baseline counseling for PrEP and risk reduction. The 36 networks will then be randomized in equal numbers to intervention and comparison conditions. In each intervention condition network, a cadre of network leaders open to PrEP, trusted for advice, and highly interconnected with others will attend an intervention that educates and then provides training and guidance in diffusing messages to friends to encourage PrEP uptake, correcting PrEP misconceptions and stigma, and instilling positive PrEP norms and benefit perceptions. At baseline and 6- and 15-month followup points, participants will complete measures of PrEP use corroborated by the testing of dried blood spot specimens for tenofovir; measures of PrEP related knowledge, attitudes, perceived norms, and stage of change readiness; sexual risk practices; and substance use. We hypothesize that the network intervention will produce greater PrEP adoption by HIV- participants than that found in comparison networks. PrEP knowledge, attitudes, intentions, peer norms, and stage of change readiness will be explored as both mediators and as secondary outcomes. Intervention effects on HIV incidence will be mathematically modeled to determine its public health impact. This research will test a novel approach for increasing PrEP use among neglected racial minority MSM in mid-sized American cities who can best—and can perhaps only—be reached through their social network connections. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) regimens greatly reduce the likelihood that high-risk uninfected men who have sex with men (MSM) will contract HIV infection. However, PrEP use remains very low in mid-sized cities across the country, especially among African American MSM who may be hidden in the community and hard to reach through conventional PrEP awareness campaigns. This research will employ a social network approach for both reaching racial minority MSM in the community and delivering an intervention in which peer network leaders are taught and enlisted to increase awareness, correct misconceptions, reduce stigma, and increase benefit perception and positive attitudes of their network members toward PrEP. Results of the study will improve models for HIV prevention implementation science among African American MSM in neglected regions of the country.  ",Increasing PrEP Use in High-Risk Social Networks of African American MSM in Underserved Low-Uptake Cities,9962497,R01NR017574,"['Adoption ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Goals ', ' Happiness ', ' positive attitude ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Industrialization ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' Maintenance ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest US ', ' Persons ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Seeds ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' seed ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Syphilis ', ' great pox ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' Friendships ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Diffuse ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' uptake ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Community Networks ', ' Spottings ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' Viread ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' behavior change ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' HIV risk ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' neglect ', ' community intervention ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Regimen ', ' Prevention trial ', ' AAMSM ', ' African American MSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' BMSM ', ' black MSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' peer networks ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' support network ', ' racial minority ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NINR,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R01,2020,670046,0.3182091571784418
"Predicting the impact of cost on HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake and racial/ethnic disparities among MSM PROJECT SUMMARY  Daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in preventing HIV infection. However, PrEP uptake across at-risk populations including men who have sex with men (MSM) may be limited by out-of- pocket costs. Out-of-pocket costs include copays, coinsurance, and deductibles and may be a significant barrier to PrEP initiation and retention even among insured individuals. Despite being a commonly reported barrier to care, little is known about the impact of out-of-pocket costs on PrEP uptake. We propose a mixed methods and modeling study to determine the maximum out-of-pocket costs for optimal PrEP uptake in different populations including Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino MSM. The specific aims of the proposed study are to: 1) conduct 45 semi-structured interviews with MSM to explore how out-of-pocket costs may impact PrEP uptake; and 2) model the impact of co-pays, coinsurance, and deductibles on PrEP uptake. Findings from this pilot study will inform future development of interventions that address cost as a barrier to PrEP uptake, and ultimately improve outcomes in populations at highest risk for HIV acquisition. This study aligns with the high priority topic of identifying gaps in the PrEP care continuum and associated determinants of health, and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in PrEP uptake and use as defined by the NIH and Office of AIDS Research. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Although pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in preventing HIV, high out-of-pocket costs (i.e., co-pays, deductibles, and co-insurance) may prohibit uptake of the intervention. This study evaluates the extent to which out-of-pocket costs may limit PrEP uptake. The results of this study will provide insight for public health programs as well as for development of future interventions that address cost as a barrier to PrEP uptake.",Predicting the impact of cost on HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake and racial/ethnic disparities among MSM,9830675,R21MH118019,"['Appointment ', ' Coinsurance ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Deductibles ', ' Deductibles and Coinsurance ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elasticity ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fumarates ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Infection ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Study models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poverty ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research Support ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Underinsured ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Viread ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Oral ', ' Country ', ' Structure ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', "" beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine "", ' emtricitabine ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' NIH Office of AIDS Research ', ' life-time risk ', ' lifetime risk ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cost ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Outcome ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Population ', ' safety net ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' improved outcome ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' insurance plan ', ' ']",NIMH,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R21,2020,232682,0.3203184133977336
"Optimizing PrEP Utilization among Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Using Women of Color Project Summary This administrative supplement (PA-18-591) in response to NOT-AA-20-011, leverages an existing NIAAA U34 study for time-sensitive research on the impact of social environmental stressors related to COVID-19 on patient and provider experience in the HIV continuum of care for the most HIV-affected ethnic minority female populations in S. Florida, now in one of the epicenters of the new pandemic. The public health emergency posed by COVID-19 has caused unprecedented disruption in daily living, social structures, and employment as mitigation mandates of social distancing have been enforced to slow the spread of illness. Emerging evidence suggests that the most severe consequences from the novel coronavirus and the mitigation efforts will fall upon U.S. ethnic minority populations historically burdened by health disparities. The parent study, “Optimizing PrEP Utilization among Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Using Women of Color” (U34AA026219), is the first such project devoted to improving implementation and uptake of PrEP among African American, LatinX and Haitian women in the HIV hotspots of S. Florida and has produced a replicable model driven by community-based participatory research (CBPR). Before COVID-19, these study populations had limited economic resources, prevalent health disparities and reported high levels of intimate partner violence. The possible deleterious effects of the pandemic have not yet been investigated or reported for women of color in the South or for the HIV health care providers that serve them. The supplement will utilize longitudinal, mixed methods data collection within the parent study’s social ecological framework to fill critical knowledge gaps about the pandemic’s impact on engagement in care and adherence to PrEP and supportive services for alcohol and drug use, mental health, and other ancillary care in the three key ethnic minority populations of women. Our specific aims include: 1) remotely assess experiences in AOD use, engagement in care, PrEP medication adherence, and HIV risk factors among a sample of women of color at risk for HIV who are currently enrolled participants in the parent study, comparing measures taken pre-COVID-19, (T1), to post-COVID assessments, (T2 and T3), taken 3 months apart; 2) measure via internet surveys changes in health services delivery and social distancing due to the pandemic on access to and perceived quality of care, patient trust, and provider stress among a group of health care workers who participated in the community mobilization phase of the parent study; and 3) remotely conduct semi-structured interviews with a subset of women from Aim 1 and health providers from Aim 2 to explore COVID-related experiences, needs, areas for improvement in care, and strategies to engage and retain AOD-using women in the HIV continuum of care. The methods and implementation of the proposed aims will be fulfilled within the parent study’s CBPR framework and will inform efforts to offset the adverse stressors of the pandemic and preserve gains that have been made in HIV prevention in these populations. Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance Despite FDA approval in 2012, followed by recommendations from the CDC and WHO, the majority of women in the U.S. are not aware of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as an HIV prevention strategy that applies to them. The proposed supplemental study will use a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) model to to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on engagement in care and adherence to PrEP and supportive services for alcohol and drug use, mental health, and other ancillary care in women ethnic minority populations in S. Florida, the region with the highest HIV rates in the U.S. The counties targeted in the parent study are also the foremost hotspots for COVID-19 in the state but little is known about the pandemic’s effects on women who had been receiving or seeking HIV-related services prior to COVID-19 and the mitigation efforts. The methods and implementation of the proposed aims will inform efforts to offset the adverse stressors of the pandemic and preserve gains that have been made in HIV prevention in these

"Using Implementation Science to Increase PrEP Uptake among African American Women in the South Project Summary/Abstract HIV and intimate partner violence (IPV) are intersecting, mutually-reinforcing epidemics that significantly affect African American women, particularly women in the U.S. South. African American women face some of the highest rates of both HIV and IPV among U.S. women, and these burdens are most pronounced in the South. IPV-exposed African American women may experience forced, condomless sex, which increases the risk of HIV acquisition. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the most innovative HIV prevention strategy, however it remains underutilized by African American women and residents of the South. In order to reduce African American women’s HIV acquisition risk in the South, effective HIV prevention interventions need to concurrently address relationship safety and HIV acquisition risks. The proposed training plan in this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) application will provide the knowledge and skills that the principal investigator, Tiara C. Willie, PhD, MA needs to launch an independent and productive research career. Further, the proposed research would contribute significantly to PrEP implementation in real-world settings and facilitate PrEP access to African American women in the South. The proposed research aims to address this call via the development, testing, and evaluation of a PrEP Implementation Toolkit for staff in community healthcare clinics in the South. The Toolkit will be evaluated using the Reach, Effectiveness- Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM). The Toolkit will facilitate PrEP uptake among eligible African American women in the South, especially IPV-exposed women. This K01 project includes formative work (i.e., reach stage), like key informant interviews with staff at partnering clinics (N=10), and six focus groups with African American women. The qualitative data will inform the development of the PrEP Implementation Toolkit. The Toolkit will be employed in two clinics using a nonrandomized waitlist control design. Monthly aggregated clinic data will be collected 8-months before and after Toolkit implementation in each clinic. Toolkit effectiveness will be assessed using interrupted time series analyses and outcomes are changes in PrEP uptake, coverage and retention among African American women. Four focus groups with staff will be conducted to assess adoption, acceptability, and feasibility. 20 qualitative interviews with staff will be conducted to assess fidelity. This project will yield preliminary evidence of a PrEP implementation program for African American women with a focus on IPV. It will also inform future large-scale studies using stepped- wedge designs. The training acquired by Dr. Willie via this timely and novel project, courses, workshops, conferences, manuscript and grant-writing, and mentorship will target 3 training objectives to gain expertise in: (1) HIV prevention research among African American women, (2) intervention development and evaluation, and (3) implementation science in clinics. Project Narrative Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may be a viable option for African American women at-risk for HIV infection, but few studies have identified optimal strategies to reach African American women in need of PrEP nor examined effective strategies to scale-up PrEP among African American women in the South. African American women in the South experience high rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) which could force women to choose between HIV prevention or IPV prevention. The proposed research study seeks to develop, pilot-test, and evaluate a PrEP Implementation Toolkit within two community healthcare clinics located in Jackson, Mississippi to increase PrEP uptake among African American, address IPV as a barrier to PrEP uptake, and ultimately combat racial disparities in women’s HIV diagnoses.",Using Implementation Science to Increase PrEP Uptake among African American Women in the South,10012561,K01MD015005,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Counseling ', ' Epidemic ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mississippi ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' HRSA ', ' Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' prevent violence ', ' violence prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' condomless intercourse ', ' condomless sex ', ' unprotected intercourse ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' care seeking ', ' Manuscripts ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' research study ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' HIV risk ', ' reproductive ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Interruption ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' implementation science ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' combat ', ' screening ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' South African ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' service delivery ', ' exposure to violence ', ' violence exposure ', ' ']",NIMHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,135135,0.24038502834131809
"Latinx MSM PrEP Disparities due to Immigration Stress and Drug Use Networks PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: Miami-Dade County, FL (MDC) has the highest HIV incidence in the US. As of June 2017, 61% of new HIV diagnoses in MDC were attributed to Latinxs; and sexual contact with men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for 92% of new HIV diagnoses among Latinx men. Of Latinxs diagnosed with HIV in 2017 in MDC, 85% were foreign-born. Alarmingly, new HIV diagnosis have increased 64% among Latinx MSM in MDC since 2010. While rates of PrEP usage in the US have significantly increased, only 6% of Latinx MSM were enrolled in a PrEP program in MDC. The Social Network Theory of Homophily can explain why these disparities impact LMSM communities so aggressively: similarities in characteristics between LMSM friendship dyads can impact the configuration of social networks. In turn, these network configurations can affect LMSM access to PrEP information, communication, and providers. The overarching goal of this F31 training program will be to study the effect of dyadic homophily (based on country of origin, immigration stress, Latinx cultural values, and substance use) on PrEP information within LMSM friendship networks and geographic accessibility to providers. The purpose of F31 training program is to sharpen my research skills and to provide the experiences for a career as an independent scientist well-qualified to obtain a postdoctoral position at a major research university. To pursue this F31 fellowship, I am supported by a strong team of Sponsors and a Senior Advisory Committee who will provide training in: 1) clinical research targeting the intertwining epidemics of HIV and substance use among MSM; 2) social network analysis to address Latinx health disparities; 3) comprehensive client-centered and culturally responsive LMSM PrEP services; and 4) geospatial analysis using GIS. Research component: I will conduct secondary data analyses using Dr. Mariano Kanamori’s (F31 Co-Primary Sponsor) project, PrEParados, with data specifically collected for this F31 application (N=156 LMSM grouped into 12 friendship networks). Aim 1 will determine whether homophily—based on country of origin, immigration stress, Latinx cultural values, and substance use—between dyads is associated with PrEP knowledge and communication within LMSM friendship networks. Aim 2 will determine whether the density due to homophily on LMSM dyads’ immigration stress, Latinx cultural values, and substance use is associated with geographic accessibility (walking, public transportation, and driving; times and distances) to available clinical PrEP services. The central hypotheses are that 1) there is an association between homophily on country of origin, immigration stress, Latinx cultural values, and substance use, and the configuration of social LMSM social networks, and 2) this social network configuration is associated with access to PrEP information within networks and geographic accessibility to PrEP providers. Significance: Findings of this F31 study will lead the development of a clinical trial to test a PrEP information dissemination model implemented within LMSM social networks to identify hubs capable of addressing HIV disparities experienced in HIV hotspots. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will characterize the role of homophily on country of origin, immigration stress, Latinx cultural values, and substance use on the configuration of the social networks of Latinx men who have sex with men (LMSM); and how various configurations of social networks can influence LMSM access to preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) information within networks and geographic accessibility to PrEP. This study will utilize dyadic, sociocentric, and spatially-explicit network visualizations and analysis to address a critical gap in the literature: how to address factors widening the HIV disparity wedge among sexual and ethnic minorities. The results of the F31 research component will inform the development and implementation of culturally-tailored PrEP information and service enhancement interventions for LMSM.",Latinx MSM PrEP Disparities due to Immigration Stress and Drug Use Networks,10161304,F31MD015988,"['Affect ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diffusion ', ' Epidemic ', ' Fellowship ', ' Florida ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Immigration ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' dissemination of results ', ' Information Services ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Literature ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methodology ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Transportation ', ' Universities ', ' County ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Walking ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Social Network ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' density ', ' Friendships ', ' Procedures ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' uptake ', ' Immigrant ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' prevention service ', ' cultural values ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Research Training ', ' Targeted Research ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' male group ', "" men's group "", ' sexual minority ', ' marginalization ', ' social exclusion ', ' Visualization ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,F31,2020,45520,0.24320068526994731
"Optimizing PrEP Utilization among Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Using Women of Color Project Summary As we edge closer to the half century mark of the HIV epidemic, the disproportionate effect on women of color in the U.S. continues to be jolting. Women overall have been at a disadvantage in the epidemic due to gender differences and norms that shape biological, social and economic vulnerability. Racial and ethnic disparities magnify the risk. Co-factors such as alcohol and other drug (AOD) use intersect and reinforce other comorbidities. Living in a high prevalence area significantly hardens the risk and makes it tougher to overcome. Options to help women stay HIV negative have been limited. However, this obstacle shifted several years ago with FDA approval and CDC endorsement of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Yet, the majority of U.S. women do not know that PrEP can be a female-controlled strategy or that it applies to them—and backup has not been forthcoming from providers or their communities. What is most disturbing, however, is the absence of PrEP as an accessible strategy among women of color in high impact regions of the country. This developmental U34 responds to RFA-AA-17-013, which prioritizes community based participatory research (CBPR) to develop implementation models for women that address alcohol and HIV in high impact regions and communities. The proposed study will produce an evidence- and CBPR-driven PrEP implementation intervention to enhance uptake and optimize use among women of color in South Florida, which is currently the highest impact region of the U.S. with HIV rates recently determined by the CDC to be the highest in the nation. The study builds upon the team’s experience in alcohol/HIV intervention and CBPR in South Florida and preliminary work with stakeholders from the greater Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas to develop a multi- level PrEP intervention program for African American, Latina, and Haitian women who engage in risky sex and AOD use. The study includes researchers from the Southern HIV and Alcohol Research Consortium (SHARC) and will inform the design of target and comparison groups and other features of a U01 for further study within the NIAAA CHAART Consortia. Guided by the social ecological framework, the study will: identify needs, priorities, and community strengths and develop a PrEP continuum during a summit to engage stakeholders (Aim 1); produce a replicable implementation program, including manuals, materials, instruments, and procedures, through the formation of a Community Advisory and Advocacy Board (Aim 2); and conduct an exploratory pilot among 120 multi-ethnic women of color in Broward and Miami-Dade counties to test fidelity, feasibility and acceptability and measure PrEP uptake and adherence and retention in care over a 6 month period. The study will utilize biomarkers in a subsample to compare with self-reports and pharmacy refill measures. It will be among the first to develop a PrEP intervention in the South for women of color, and is thus in line with the specific high funding priorities of the Office of AIDS Research on cross-cutting research to reduce health disparities in developing implementation approaches for bio-behavioral strategies such as PrEP. Public Health Relevance Despite FDA approval in 2012, followed by recommendations from the CDC and WHO, the majority of women in the U.S. are not aware of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as an HIV prevention strategy that applies to them. The purpose of this study is to use a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) model to develop and preliminarily test an intervention program that will optimize oral PrEP utilization among women of color in South Florida, the region with the highest HIV rates in the U.S. The intervention will evaluate fidelity, feasibility and acceptability, determine patterns of PrEP uptake and adherence and retention in care, and explore the known correlates of risk such as AOD use.",Optimizing PrEP Utilization among Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) Using Women of Color,10053581,U34AA026219,"['Acquired

"Increasing PrEP Use in High-Risk Social Networks of African American MSM in Underserved Low-Uptake Cities Abstract  Transgender women—especially racial minority transgender women—have HIV prevalence that is far higher than any other population segment in the United States. Nearly two-thirds of transgender women meet CDC criteria for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) indication but only 5% report ever taking PrEP. Most prior HIV prevention research has lumped together transgender women in a single category with men who have sex with men (MSM) even though these sexual and gender minority (SGM) groups may face different life challenges and have very different needs. Except for a handful of small focus group studies conducted in large cities on the East and West coasts, very little research has systematically explored factors responsible for low PrEP use among transgender women at high risk for contacting HIV infection and identified ways to increase PrEP adoption and sustained use. This proposal—submitted in response to Notice OD-20-032—requests an SGM administrative supplement to add a sample of racial minority transgender women to parent grant R01- NR017574, a project that tests approaches to increase PrEP use among African American MSM in Milwaukee and Cleveland, both Midwestern cities with stark HIV disparities. The supplement will employ a mixed-methods research design with 60 high-risk racial minority transgender women recruited from the community who will be added to the parent grant. During study visits, each woman will participate in a semi-structured in-depth interview to elicit perceptions, understandings, and beliefs about PrEP; concerns and barriers to PrEP use; factors that would facilitate the adoption and sustained use of PrEP; and preferences about PrEP delivery modalities and service access. Interviews will delve into how PrEP can be presented to transgender women in ways that affirm a positive, healthful, and proud sense of gender identity that counteracts the deleterious influence of intersectional stigma. In-depth interviews will be recorded, transcribed, coded, and qualitatively analyzed to identify how best to optimize and tailor interventions to reach and benefit the HIV prevention and health needs of transgender women. Participants will also be administered measures that are being employed in the parent grant to assess HIV testing and health history, sexual practices, substance use, and PrEP use knowledge, attitudes, behavioral intentions, norm perceptions, and self-efficacy, as well as a measure of gender minority stress and resilience validated with transgender and gender nonconforming persons. These quantitative data will be analyzed to identify whether—and how—the HIV prevention needs of racial minority transgender women differ from those of racial minority MSM as well as factors that facilitate or impede PrEP use among transgender women. Findings of this research will improve the field’s understanding of HIV health needs of transgender minority women—a vulnerable, understudied, and underserved SGM community population—and will inform implementation efforts to achieve the goals of the National Plan to End the HIV epidemic.

"Peer-driven intervention promoting pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake among African American and Hispanic/Latino men who have sex with men PROJECT SUMMARY  The proposed K01 application will catalyze Dr. Tao’s independent career as an infectious disease epidemiologist with expertise in HIV prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), qualitative interviews, respondent driven sampling (RDS), social network analysis (SNA), and mathematic modeling in addressing health disparities in access to PrEP care (Career goals). The PI and her co-primary mentor are based in the Department of Medicine at Brown University, and will also work closely with co-primary mentor and co-mentors at the School of Public Health at Brown University, at Rutgers University, and at the University of Mississippi. Together, this team of mentors and institutional environment will allow the junior PI a high chance of success in completing the research goals and becoming an NIH-funded independent investigator. African American (AA) and Hispanic/Latino (H/L) men who have sex with men (MSM) bear a disproportionate HIV disease burden in the United States (US). PrEP is highly effective in reducing HIV acquisition, but PrEP uptake among AA and H/L MSM has been slow compared to White MSM. Effective and novel interventions are needed to promote PrEP uptake in these populations to reduce HIV incidence. A peer-driven intervention (PDI) is based on RDS methodology and has been demonstrated to be a highly effective, culturally appropriate, and low-cost approach to engage hard-to-reach populations in HIV prevention. The effect of a PDI on PrEP uptake, especially among AA and H/L MSM, is unknown. In this proposed study, we will conduct 30 individual interviews (15 AA and 15 H/L MSM) to explore facilitators and barriers to PrEP uptake and determine components of an effective PDI among AA and H/L MSM (Specific Aim[SA]1). The effect of a PDI on PrEP uptake will be assessed and compared to a group of AA and H/L MSM who will be recruited by venue-based sampling (N=200, 50 AA and 50 H/L MSM in each group) (SA2). Using data from the SA2, we will perform microsimulations in the context of an agent-based model to evaluate the impact of a PDI on PrEP uptake and HIV incidence at the population level (SA3). PROJECT NARRATIVE  Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in preventing HIV transmission among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM). However, preliminary studies show that African American (AA) and Hispanic/Latino (H/L) MSM have lower rates of PrEP uptake than their White counterparts. This study will investigate a peer-driven intervention to promote PrEP uptake among AA and H/L MSM to help reduce HIV incidence in these populations.",Peer-driven intervention promoting pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake among African American and Hispanic/Latino men who have sex with men,10078403,K01MH119960,"['Epidemiologist ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' open label study ', ' open label ', ' comparator group ', ' comparison group ', ' cost ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' high risk ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' efficacy testing ', ' screening ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' Awareness ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Control Groups ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mississippi ', ' Study models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Population Sizes ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' Respondent ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Location ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' social organization ', ' success ', ' condoms ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' ']",NIMH,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,K01,2020,157408,0.19797805844849764
"Brown University Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program Project Summary/Abstract Assessment of current programs designed to increase diversity in STEM disciplines at Brown University has revealed the need to specifically address the critical transition from undergraduate into doctoral training programs. The goal of Brown PREP is to diversify and enrich the biomedical research endeavor by increasing the number of students enrolled in and completing doctoral training programs. Informed by best practices and lessons learned from an institutional pilot PREP program, we describe an innovative program characterized by a comprehensive and customizable set of interventions to support and advance underrepresented students' academic and career development.  Each year, our program will recruit and support eight research-oriented baccalaureate graduates from underrepresented backgrounds and provide them with interdisciplinary research experiences, individualized academic planning, professional development, and skill-building activities to increase their competitiveness and readiness for high-caliber doctoral programs. Participating departments for Brown's proposed PREP reside in the Life and Medical Sciences Division and include biology, neuroscience, psychology, public health and cognitive, linguistic and psychological sciences.  In addition to intensive interdisciplinary research experiences and knowledge development, multiple mentorship and community building opportunities permeate the activities of the Brown PREP. Creating a community of scholars that will help students successfully navigate program requirements is viewed as essential to helping students reach their full potential in a short period of time. The use of Individual Development Plans (IDP) will ensure that the Brown PREP research, educational and professional development activities are specifically tailored to address each student's academic and career goals. As important, the Brown PREP will provide opportunities for faculty to engage in conversations about the importance of developing a diverse workforce in the biomedical and behavioral sciences. We have developed a comprehensive evaluation plan to assess outcomes and progress toward meeting the overall goal and aims of this project and monitor quality assurance across the proposed interventions.  As designed, the Brown PREP will increase the production of underrepresented students who obtain a doctoral degree in the biomedical sciences; institutionalize best practices on training and mentoring diverse scholars that can be shared among the Brown community and beyond; and diversify the biomedical research workforce. Project Narrative This program addresses an important societal need to increase the number of individuals from underrepresented backgrounds who enter and complete doctoral programs in the biomedical and behavioral sciences.

"Increasing Uptake of HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis among Young, Black MSM in the South PROJECT SUMMARY: The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to provide Latesha Elopre, MD, MSPH the essential mentorship and career development necessary to become an independent investigator whose research will contribute to decreasing health inequity among underserved and disproportionately impacted populations regarding HIV infection rates. The initial focus of her work will be in developing a behavioral intervention to increase uptake of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among young, Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Deep South. Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 50% of black MSM will become infected with HIV in their lifetime. Furthermore, the Southern United States is seeing the highest rates of new HIV infections in this population, with rates rapidly increasing for young, black MSM. Through consistent use of PrEP, a biomedical prevention tool, decreased HIV infection rates can be seen among young, Black MSM. Research focusing on increasing HIV prevention services and decreasing health disparities in HIV incidence have been high priority for the NIH. However, there have been few studies evaluating PrEP uptake among young, Black MSM in the Deep South. In concordance with prior research that has shown individual and structural factors leading to increased stigma and marginalization for black MSM, this study will be grounded in the Andersen Behavioral Model for Healthcare Utilization with subsequent individual level intervention driven by the situated Information, Motivation and Behavioral skills theoretical framework. This conceptual model will allow for investigation of core determinants of health behavior in the context of individual and societal barriers influencing health service utilization. A mixed-methods research design will aid in targeted intervention development with a more granular understanding of potential barriers for PrEP uptake. Hypothesis: Characteristics that pertain to stigma related to PrEP, HIV, race, religion and poverty as well as healthcare access will be major barriers to awareness and uptake of PrEP for young, Black MSM in the South. The specific aims for this research proposal are as follows: Aim 1: Determine critical beliefs and attitudes regarding PrEP awareness and uptake among young, Black MSM in the South. Aim 2: Determine environmental barriers for delivery of PrEP to young, black MSM in the South. Aim 3: Develop a targeted intervention to increase PrEP uptake among young, Black MSM in the South. With guidance from my mentorship team, a career development plan has been created to gain training in behavioral theory, intervention development and mixed-methods research design enabled by additional coursework, hands on training, seminars and national workshops. Upon completion of the proposed scientific aims, I will be poised to pilot a theory-guided behavioral intervention to enhance PrEP uptake among young black MSM in the U.S. Deep South supported by an R-series grant. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Disproportionately high numbers of HIV infection are seen among young, Black men who have sex with men (MSM) who live in the Southern United States. New estimates from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention predict 1 in 2 Black MSM will be infected with HIV in their lifetime. Biomedical HIV prevention strategies, such as HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), have been shown to effectively decrease rates of HIV infection by up to 92% with consistent use. The project described in this application will develop a theory- driven behavioral intervention, utilizing a mixed-methods research design, to increase uptake of PrEP among young, Black MSM in the South.","Increasing Uptake of HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis among Young, Black MSM in the South",9851451,K23MH112417,"['Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use

"PrEP Demonstration Project among Women at Risk for HIV Infection PROJECT SUMMARY African-American (AA) women living in the Deep South are 10 times more likely to be infected with HIV than white women. Traditional HIV prevention methods, including STI/HIV education, comprehensive behavioral interventions, and provision of condoms have rendered minimal success in this population. HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has become a promising biomedical prevention tool, with over 90% efficacy as shown in numerous trials. PrEP has the potential to curb incident HIV infection among at-risk women; however, biomedical HIV prevention work in the US has generally focused on men who have sex with men, often leaving women (particularly women of racial/ethnic minority status) underserved, and a disparity with respect to HIV infection inadequately addressed. Implementation science projects are urgently needed to evaluate and overcome barriers to PrEP awareness, uptake, adherence, and persistence in this population. The objective of this application is to increase PrEP uptake among AA women at-risk for HIV-infection in the rural South, specifically those seeking care at Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers (FQHC) in rural Alabama. We will use a mixed-methods approach to adapt and pilot test a patient-provider communication tool from the CDC PrEP toolkit that focuses on the first three steps of the PrEP cascade (e.g., recognizing HIV risk, identifying as a PrEP candidate, and interested in PrEP) to increase PrEP uptake via referrals to local PrEP clinics. Specifically, we propose: (1) to explore the HIV risk perceptions of AA women with recent PrEP use (N=15-25), AA women who are candidates for PrEP (N=15-25), and providers (N=20) and identify preferences around patient-provider communication about HIV risk and PrEP services that address the needs of AA women; (2A) To systematically adapt a patient-provider communication tool to increase PrEP uptake at two FQHCs in rural Alabama, using an iterative implementation process; and (2B). To assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of the patient-provider communication intervention on PrEP uptake among AA women and their providers in a pilot pre-/post-intervention design (N=250). As part of aim 2B), we will also systematically document and evaluate reasons for declining a PrEP referral, reasons for incomplete referrals, reasons for failing to initiate PrEP after a successful referral, and ongoing PrEP use at 3/6 months post PrEP initiation among our sample. The proposed work will significantly contribute to our understanding of factors impacting PrEP uptake and use among AA women at high-risk for HIV-infection, particularly in underserved, rural areas in the Deep South that are increasingly impacted by the HIV epidemic and have worse health outcomes relative to other areas in the US. The results of this work will also directly contribute to a full-scale, R01-level cluster randomized implementation trial in which we will measure the effectiveness and cost associated with a PrEP services delivery intervention serving AA women at-risk for HIV-infection in primary care and reproductive health centers in rural areas of the Deep South. PROJECT NARRATIVE African American women (AA), particularly those living in the rural southeastern United States, remain persistently at risk for HIV infection. Pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PrEP) is a highly effective HIV prevention tool that may circumvent barriers to the use of traditional HIV prevention tools, such as condom use; however, we know very little about how to help AA women at high-risk for HIV-infection effectively access and use PrEP during periods of risk. This project seeks to understand how to make PrEP more accessible to these women, which may ultimately affect HIV incidence in this population.",PrEP Demonstration Project among Women at Risk for HIV Infection,10002300,R34MH118044,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Alabama ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Communities ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Family Planning ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' Southeast US ', ' statistics ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Funding ', ' uptake ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' care seeking ', ' condoms ', ' Prevention ', ' HIV risk ', ' risk perception ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' microbicidal ', ' microbicide ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Communication Tools ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' post intervention ', ' implementation trial ', ' cost ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' underserved rural area ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' aged ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' implementation science ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' effectiveness measure ', ' HIV/STI ', ' STD/HIV ', ' STI/HIV ', ' HIV/STD ', ' screening ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' rural counties ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' service delivery ', ' rate of infection ', ' infection rate ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R34,2020,237078,0.30855673262086025
"EHR-Based Prediction Models to Improve PrEP Use in Community Health Centers PROJECT SUMMARY Rates of new HIV infections are disproportionately high, and uptake of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) low, in Black, Latino, and underinsured individuals in the U.S. Healthcare providers at safety net community health centers (CHCs) provide care to racially diverse populations with high rates of underinsurance. However, providers cite barriers to PrEP prescribing, including lack of tools to identify candidates for PrEP. Without practical tools to help providers identify patients at risk for HIV infection and prescribe PrEP when appropriate, the population-level benefits of PrEP are unlikely to be realized. Electronic clinical decision support using data embedded in patients’ electronic health records (EHRs) has the potential to fulfill this need. EHRs contain rich data that can help identify patients at high risk of HIV acquisition, including demographics, diagnoses, testing patterns, prescriptions, and social determinants of health. In our prior work, we developed and validated prediction models using EHR data from two large healthcare systems in Massachusetts and California, with patient populations of 1.1 and 4.3 million, to identify patients at high risk for incident HIV. These machine learning models had strong predictive performance, with C-statistics up to 0.91. The objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that a clinical decision support tool that incorporates an HIV risk prediction model can help providers identify patients at high risk for HIV infection and improve PrEP prescribing. Our study setting is a national network of CHCs with 2.8 million patients (OCHIN). We will first tailor our HIV prediction models to this clinic network, and then conduct formative work with providers to inform our development of alerts and additional PrEP decision support tools that will be effective and welcomed. The study team includes experts in HIV, PrEP implementation, predictive analytics, and healthcare delivery in CHCs. Our specific aims are to 1) optimize prediction models that use EHR data to identify potential PrEP candidates in racially, socioeconomically, and geographically diverse patient populations; 2) explore providers’ perspectives on barriers to PrEP prescribing, and their preferences for PrEP decision support, to inform development of an EHR-based decision support tool for CHCs; and 3) conduct a pilot trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of an EHR-based clinical decision support intervention on PrEP-related care in CHCs. We will assess impact on metrics across the PrEP care continuum, including prescriptions, persistence, clinical monitoring, and tests and diagnoses of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. This proposal is innovative in its use of predictive analytics and clinical decision support to optimize PrEP. The project is significant because our intervention will be scalable across CHCs nationally and to other healthcare systems with EHRs, and because it addresses the federal initiative to end the HIV epidemic by scaling up PrEP in high- incidence settings. The expected outcome is the foundation for a cluster randomized trial to test whether EHR- based decision support for PrEP can prevent new HIV infections in a national network of CHCs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Scale-up of HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a key strategy of the federal initiative to end the HIV epidemic. However, healthcare providers lack tools to identify patients who are at increased risk for HIV infection and thus potential candidates for PrEP. This research will lay essential groundwork for a full-scale study to test whether integrating automated tools into electronic health records to help providers identify potential candidates for PrEP can improve PrEP prescribing and prevent new HIV infections in community health centers.",EHR-Based Prediction Models to Improve PrEP Use in Community Health Centers,9926611,R34MH122291,"['Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' California ', ' Clinical Informatics ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Counseling ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Hepatitis B ', ' Hepatitis B Infection ', ' Viral Hepatitis B ', ' infection with HBV ', ' infection with hepatitis B virus ', ' serum hepatitis ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' hep C ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' statistics ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Latino ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Underinsured ', ' Caring ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Prophylaxis ', ' Prophylactic treatment ', ' Clinical ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Individual ', ' uptake ', ' Community Health Networks ', ' tool ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Notification ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' antiretroviral ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' member ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' pilot trial ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' routine care ', ' HIV/STI ', ' STD/HIV ', ' STI/HIV ', ' HIV/STD ', ' social health determinants ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' support tools ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' clinical decision support ', ' risk prediction model ', ' Automated Clinical Decision Support ', ' side effect ', ' anal pap screening ', ' anal pap test ', ' anal pap smear ', ' ']",NIMH,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R34,2020,280307,0.34266107061974954
" A Multicomponent Intervention to Increase HIV Risk Perceptions and PrEP Initiation among Black Men Who Have Sex With Men PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Tragically, HIV infections among Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) in the U.S. persist. Despite the availability and interest in pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), effective uptake among BMSM remains low. It is imperative to mitigate barriers to PrEP initiation among this group, which could require HIV interventions that incorporate behavioral, biomedical, and structural strategies. The proposed theory-guided, multi-component intervention is designed to enhance HIV risk perceptions and increase PrEP initiation among BMSM in Baltimore City, using an existing mobile smartphone application along with peer change agents to record and review sexual risk behaviors and encourage PrEP initiation. The proposed research and training plan in this Mentored Research Scientist Developmental Award (K01) proposal will provide the principal investigator, Derek T. Dangerfield II, PhD, with the skills needed in intervention design to develop into a productive, independent investigator. The research and training aims proposed address a critical gap in HIV prevention; it is well established that extant work has failed to substantially lower infections among BMSM throughout the U.S. To strategically advance these training aims, this K01 proposal is crafted to facilitate professional development and research capacities as a rising independent investigator. Targeted course work, didactic workshops, and in-depth mentorship from experts in the domains of clinical intervention design, life course theoretical approaches to health, and statistical analysis are incorporated to facilitate hands-on opportunities to apply newly developed skills. The combined use of technology, peers, and PrEP leverages existing relevant prevention strategies for a multi-component intervention. This research is innovative and timely as it responds to federal and academic calls for carefully considerate, interdisciplinary interventions to reduce HIV incidence among priority populations. The aims of this proposal incorporate qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore the preferences of the components of an intervention to increase PrEP initiation among the population. This research has implications for understanding whether the methods used in this intervention can be applied in clinical settings or can be applied in peer-based settings to circumvent the barriers of traditional healthcare engagement. Dr. Dangerfield will be primarily mentored by senior investigator Jason Farley, PhD, MPH, ANP-BC, FAAN at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, with additional mentoring from Drs. Chris Beyrer (Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health), Ricky Bluthenthal (University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine), and Renata Arrington-Sanders (Johns Hopkins School of Medicine). Through research and didactic mentoring and training, Dr. Dangerfield will build upon his expertise in behavioral social science to develop a successful career in designing high-impact, multicomponent clinical interventions and reduce health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study offers a three-phase study to design, refine, and pilot test an intervention to increase HIV risk perceptions and effective initiation of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among Black men who have sex with men in Baltimore, Maryland. This theory-based, multi-component strategy will utilize a mobile smartphone application along with peer change agents to increase HIV risk perception and PrEP initiation using an existing app available in Maryland. The results of this strategy have critical implications for understanding effective PrEP introduction methods to reduce HIV incidence among this high-priority population.", A Multicomponent

"UMB Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of Ph.D. students from diverse backgrounds is acutely underrepresented in biomedical and behavioral sciences in the United States despite the growing proportions of minorities in the population. Through participation in several underrepresented minority (UR)-focused mentoring programs, the Science Training for Advancing Biomedical Research (STAR)-PREP director brings unique insights (from a mentee's perspective) and a great understanding of the attributes required for being a successful mentor. This STAR- PREP is designed to provide aspiring UR biomedical scientists with a specialized but comprehensive training plan. Highly functional and dynamic individual development plans (IDP) will be employed to address the Scholars' weaknesses and strengthen their skills to increase their competitiveness leading to acceptance into top-notch Ph.D. or M.D.-Ph.D. programs. We will take advantage of ongoing interactions with local UR- centered undergraduate programs and with various established programs including T32 grants on campus by incorporating into IDPs regular participation in T32-funded training activities. Our hypothesis is that active participation in an integrated multidimensional research, clinical and mentored research training program coupled with innovations in academic development will result in greater than 75% of PREP Scholars pursuing biomedical research careers. Aim 1 is to ensure an outstanding biomedical research experience to build and refine the STAR-PREP Scholar's research skills. This will be accomplished through use of a diverse community of outstanding faculty and students, state-of-the-art technologies and innovations in interdisciplinary education and training in an atmosphere that explicitly emphasizes excellence and biomedical research. Aim 2 is to strengthen and expand the STAR-PREP Scholar's academic portfolio to facilitate acceptance into a top-notch graduate program. This aim will also support and guide the PREP Scholar thru every step of the graduate school application process, prepare the Scholar for the GRE test and provide direct experience in select Ph.D. courses. Through Aim 3, we will provide a set of high- quality professional development activities individualized for each STAR-PREP Scholar. PREP Scholars will participate in a variety of research poster presentation forums, scientific writing workshops, diversity seminars and attend/present at a national science conference. Aim 4 will provide a continuous dynamic mentoring and community-building research-centered experience. Through this aim we propose to establish a sense of community through social and academic activities between Scholars, mentors and Ph.D. students. The success of each of our aims will be regularly assessed through individual diagnostic assessment tools administered by internal and external evaluators to ensure a positive and meaningful experience to successfully transition Scholars to graduate programs.

"Assessing Gaps in HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Initiation and Retention using Pharmacy Claims Data PROJECT SUMMARY Although nearly 1.2 million people in the United States are indicated for HIV PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis), many fail to initiate or be retained in PrEP care. Prescription requests for PrEP prescriptions are on the rise, but it is yet unknown how many requested and approved prescriptions are actually received and then taken home by patients. When eligible patients present at pharmacies to pick up PrEP, they may opt not to purchase their approved prescription. This event is known as a prescription reversal. Prescription abandonment occurs when a patient never returns to purchase the prescription. Our previously published qualitative and quantitative research suggests that cost may be a driving factor in PrEP reversals and abandonments. In spite of growing recognition that out-of-pocket copays and deductibles may present barriers to PrEP initiation and retention in PrEP care, there are no published population-based estimates of PrEP prescription reversals or abandonments, which precludes our ability to understand how patients fall out of PrEP care. Thus, the aims of this study are to (1) determine the HIV PrEP prescription reversal, delay, and abandonment rates from 2015- 2017; and detect disparities in PrEP reversals and abandonment by (2) estimating the difference in HIV PrEP prescription reversal or abandonment by racial group, geographic region, sex, and out-of-pocket cost. For this first ever study of PrEP prescription reversals and abandonments, we will use a pharmaceutical claims database with the nation’s largest share of PrEP prescription claims matched to medical claims and individual patient demographics. Estimating prescription reversals and abandonment nationally is a novel way to identify who is lost to PrEP initiation or retention at the pharmacy point-of-sale, and has implications for expansion of national safety-net (e.g., Ryan White) and medication assistance programs. Having valid estimates of prescription reversals can help us refine our estimates of who is truly retained in care, and at what endpoints patients fail to progress in the PrEP care continuum. This analysis, developed in response to patient feedback, is significant in light of major media coverage and patient protests of exorbitant PrEP costs at the point-of-sale, and the paucity of research on this real-world issue. The results will form preliminary data so that we can determine where geographically PrEP reversals happen, and among whom, and propose an R34 or R01 to qualitatively and quantitatively investigate why reversals are happening and how to intervene. Our findings will inform subsequent R series interventions by identifying cost thresholds for abandonment, and refine which specific subgroups are at highest risk of not being retained in PrEP care. The long-term goal of this research is to improve PrEP retention and ultimately decrease HIV incidence by reducing barriers to PrEP among high-risk populations. This study aligns with the high priority areas of reducing new HIV infections and supporting research to reduce racial disparities in HIV infection, as defined by the NIH and US Office of AIDS Research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although prescription requests for HIV PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) are on the rise, it is unknown how many approved prescriptions are actually received and then taken home by patients. This study uses the nation’s largest pharmaceutical claims database to assess the frequency with which patients choose not to pay for PrEP prescriptions at the pharmacy point-of-sale, known as a prescription reversal. The results of this first ever study of PrEP prescription reversals will guide who to target for subsequent R series intervention grants focused on increasing retention in PrEP care and can ultimately inform federal safety net programs, and industry-sponsored medication assistance programs.",Assessing Gaps in HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Initiation and Retention using Pharmacy Claims Data,9889189,R21NR018387,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anticancer drug ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Deductibles ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Industry ', ' Insurance ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Privatization ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sales ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' falls ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Location ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' payment ', ' copayment ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' safety net ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' demographics ', ' implementation science ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' population based ', ' AAMSM ', ' African American MSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' BMSM ', ' black MSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' individual patient ', ' racial minority ', ' gender disparity ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' ']",NINR,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,207271,0.40077640501564477
"The Effect of Intersecting Stigmas on PrEP Outcomes for Young Black MSM Abstract Despite recent progress, Black Americans continue to bear the most severe burden of HIV/AIDS in the nation, and young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) continue to be most affected. Antiretroviral pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been endorsed as a potentially effective part of HIV combination prevention strategies and an opportunity to reduce new infections among YBMSM. However, without significant efforts to develop age and culturally-tailored PrEP interventions for YBMSM, PrEP use may only be accessible and utilized by older, White, more affluent MSM, further exacerbating HIV disparities. Through the framework of intersectionality, the proposed research examines how various, intersectional stigmas may limit YBMSM’s ability and willingness to use PrEP. Various stigmas experienced by Black MSM (homonegativity, racism) are associated with adverse outcomes along the HIV care continuum and there is reason to believe these stigmas may also negatively affect PrEP outcomes. The proposed study aims to address the current lack of research on YBMSM’s barriers to using PrEP and gather the data necessary to inform a tailored intervention for YBMSM. The study will take place in Milwaukee, WI. In phase I, we will conduct 9 focus groups (n=72-90) with YBMSM ages 16-25 to explore YBMSM’s knowledge and perceptions of PrEP, identify individual, community and structural level factors likely to affect PrEP uptake among YBMSM, and examine YBMSM’s general healthcare utilization patterns and barriers. Additionally, we will employ a quantitative study to examine the relationship between various stigmas (racism, medical mistrust, homonegativity) and examine the effects of intersecting stigmas on knowledge and acceptance of PrEP among 300 YBMSM. We hypothesize that racism, homonegativity, and the intersection of those stigmas will predict lower knowledge of PrEP, reduced likelihood of using PrEP, and greater PrEP stigma. We also hypothesize that the relationships between various stigmas and PrEP outcomes will be moderated by resiliency and social support. In Phase II, we will use findings from Phase I and community-based participatory research methods to develop an evidence-based multi-level intervention tailored to YBMSM to be tested in a future R34. Findings from this study may not only be useful in increasing PrEP use among YBMSM, but may also be generalized to other outcomes along the care continuum. The training plan in this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) application will provide the training and research experience necessary to support Dr. Katherine Quinn’s transition to an independent HIV prevention and intervention researcher. Training includes four primary goals: build content expertise in intersectional stigma, develop mastery of complex statistical modeling for intersectionality and mixed-methods research, build expertise in intervention science, and enhance career and professional development. The training acquired by Dr. Quinn includes didactic coursework, academic conferences, manuscript preparation, independent study, grant writing workshops and other research activities. Project Narrative Young, black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may be an essential part of combination prevention strategies to curb these disparities. Stigma may be a limiting factor in the success of PrEP for YBMSM and this research will examine how intersectional stigma experienced by YBMSM may influence PrEP knowledge and uptake. The promise of PrEP can only be fully realized if we understand the factors that shape YBMSM’s engagement with PrEP and findings from this study will inform a tailored PrEP intervention for YBMSM.

"Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) PROJECT SUMMARY The long term goal of Mount Sinai's Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (Mount Sinai PREP) is to make a significant contribution to increasing the number of biomedical scientists from underrepresented minority groups, socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds or those who are challenged by a disability. We aim to prepare recent college graduates from these groups to enroll and succeed in competitive PhD and MD/PhD programs, and then complete postdoctoral or residency/fellowship training before entering careers in which they can contribute to biomedical research, drug development, or research on health and health care disparities. Now in its 17th year, Mount Sinai PREP alumni have garnered 24 PhD degrees, while completion of 4 more PhD degrees is also expected by the summer. During their predoctoral work, 24 Mount Sinai PREP alumni were supported by traineeships on T32 training grants, 10 were awarded F31 fellowships and many other prestigious fellowships were obtained, e.g. 3 UNCF/Merck awards. All the PREP alumni who completed PhD programs to date have entered postdoctoral work: 19 in academic settings, with prestigious fellowships including the CDC Infectious Disease Fellowship and HHMI Life Sciences Award; 1 at NIAID, with an IRTA award; 1 at the FDA with an FDA Commissioner's award; and 1 who pursued postdoctoral work at GlaxoSmithKline. Enhanced recruitment efforts, program evaluation (self-evaluation and external evaluation) and ongoing program development have enabled the program to achieve and benefit from a large applicant pool and maintain an accept/enter ratio between 1 and 1.2. Central strategies of Mount Sinai PREP include the following. We strive to ensure that each PREP scholar has a laboratory placement with an excellent faculty research mentor, supportive peer mentors, and an opportunity to work on a cutting-edge project of interest that develops analytical, conceptual and technical skills. We expect PREP scholars to integrate into laboratory activities such as lab meetings, journal clubs, and parties. They are also expected to integrate into the PREP community and activities such as workshops that build research, presentation, writing skills, or initiate a discussion of psychosocial well-being. PREP activities also include peer-led WIPs/Journal Clubs, lunches with advisors and guests with interesting paths to share, and encounters with PREP alumni. We further promote their integration into activities of the PhD, MD/PhD and master's student community of the Graduate School, which whom PREP scholars interact in courses, seminars, and both outreach and social activities. The Program joins a Regional PREP Symposium, at which the PREP scholars present their work and network. The Program will also follow up on a well-received 10 year Reunion/Retreat with a similar event every 5 years. The Program maintains close touch with PREP alumni through emails, reunions, and alumni visits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mount Sinai PREP seeks to increase the participation of individuals from underrepresented minority groups and socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals at the cutting-edge levels of biomedical research, and seeks to accommodate individuals with disabilities. Research shows that diverse groups function more effectively and innovatively than groups lacking diversity. Major benefits to public health will result from further diversification of the biomedical work-force and a diverse work-force will increase engagement and expert focus on problems related to health and health care disparities, which are in need of such focus.",Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP),9849773,R25GM064118,"['disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Paper ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' pressure ', ' Program Development ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Psychologist ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Residencies ', ' Schools ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Traineeship ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Self-Examination ', ' Self evaluation ', ' Self-Surveillance ', ' Self-reflection ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Family member ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Sister ', ' Brothers ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' biomedical scientist ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' outreach ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' drug development ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Scholars Program ', ' NCI Scholars Program ', ' NIAID ', ' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' pre-doc ', ' predoc ', ' predoctoral ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' Ph D student ', ' Ph D. student ', ' Ph.

"NEXUS: A novel social network approach to study the effects of intersectional stigma on HIV prevention among Latino MSM 220.7 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stigma is a pervasive barrier to HIV testing and PrEP use among US Latino men who have sex with men (LMSM). Routine HIV testing and large scale PrEP coverage are essential HIV prevention strategies for ending the HIV epidemic. LMSM further contend with intersectional stigma, meaning they experience or fear unjust treatment from others due to their ethnic, sexual, and masculine identities (i.e. adherence to masculinity norms). Specific to intersectional stigma, emerging quantitative research suggests exposure to stigma towards >1 intersectional identity is associated with worse health outcomes than exposure to stigma towards a single intersectional identity. While research on intersectional stigma has been largely qualitative, advanced quantitative methods offer an opportunity to identify novel actionable intervention mechanisms and targets; improving our public health response to ending the US HIV epidemic. Social network analysis is a robust method for examining how LMSM interact with and are affected by others in their social network. Social networks are important intervention targets, since network members are capable of (1) stigmatizing LMSM (i.e. stigma sources) and (2) fostering resilience and social support to reduce the negative impact of intersectional stigma on LMSM’s HIV testing and PrEP use. The current study will prospectively assess how anticipated and enacted intersectional stigma are experienced by LMSM in their social networks at baseline to effect HIV testing and PrEP use 12-months post-baseline. We will recruit 500 HIV-negative adult LMSM from MSM and Latino community organizations. Study measures, including an egocentric social network inventory, will be collected at Months 0, 6, and 12. Our primary outcomes, HIV testing and PrEP use, will be abstracted from medical records at Month 12. We will use social network analysis to: (1) Identify how LMSM experience intersectional stigma in their social networks across diverse social context (i.e. types of social relationships [e.g. family, friends, sex partners, providers], expression of intersectional identities [e.g. acculturation, outness, masculinity]) (AIM 1, primary). (2) Prospectively evaluate the effect of social network exposure to intersectional stigma on HIV testing and PrEP use (AIM 2, primary). (3) Identify novel points of intervention to reduce the harmful effects of intersectional stigma on HIV testing and PrEP use (AIMS 3-4, exploratory) and develop data–and–community-informed intervention strategies for future piloting. As the first study to use social networks to evaluate the effects of intersectional stigma on health outcomes, NEXUS is significant because new HIV diagnoses among US LMSM are increasing–due to low rates of HIV testing (undiagnosed HIV) and PrEP use–while new diagnoses among non-LMSM have stabilized or decreased. A SN approach to studying intersectional stigma is highly innovative because it reflects a substantial departure from how intersectional stigma has been studied, opening new opportunities to end the HIV epidemic. Without such efforts, intersectional stigma will persist in producing and maintaining HIV disparities among LMSM. 220.8 PROJECT NARRATIVE Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) have one of the steepest increases in new HIV diagnoses nationally, likely because intersectional stigma towards their ethnic, sexual, and gender identities (i.e. adherence to masculinity norms) uniquely amplify HIV risk in this population and impede uptake of effective HIV prevention strategies (i.e. routine HIV testing, PrEP use). Social network analysis is a highly innovative method for studying how intersectional stigma is experienced from members of Latino MSM’s social network and will be able to assess from whom and under what social contexts stigma reduction interventions can promote novel opportunities to improve HIV testing and PrEP use among Latino MSM to reduce HIV incidence in this group.",NEXUS: A novel social network approach to study the effects of intersectional stigma on HIV prevention among Latino MSM,10083121,R01MH123282,"['Accounting ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' Incidence ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Medical Records ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Research ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexuality ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Family member ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Social Network ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' racism ', ' Masculine ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' Exposure to ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' community organizations ', ' primary outcome ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia ', ' ethnic identity ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' sexual identity ', ' social relationships ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,712852,0.11573938509104728
"Evaluating the Feasibility and Acceptability of a Latino MSM Focused PrEP Uptake Intervention PROJECT ABSTRACT: HIV disparity persist among Latino men who have sex with men (MSM), especially those who are immigrants. The CDC estimates the lifetime HIV risk is 1 in 5 for Latino MSM compared to 1 in 11 for white MSM. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is a biomedical strategy highly effective in preventing HIV acquisition, with the potential to reduce the number of new HIV infections among Latino MSM in the U.S. PrEP involves once daily dosing of medications. The FDA has approved two medications, sold under the brand names Truvada® and Descovy® for daily use as PrEP. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has established clinical guidelines for administering PrEP to high-risk candidates. While evidence indicates that PrEP use is rising in the U.S., disparities persist in uptake among Latino MSM, despite their reported high levels of interest in using PrEP. To address this disparity, we propose a 2-phase project to develop a pilot PrEP intervention called Estoy PrEParado (I'm PrEPared) to facilitate initiation and adherence to PrEP among immigrant Latino MSM. The project will develop an engaging, culturally tailored intervention using the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model. The specific aims of the project are: Aim 1: based on data from a prior study, the project will elicit feedback, validation and modification to the initial content areas of the Estoy PrEParado intervention to facilitate PrEP adoption and adherence among immigrant Latino MSM; and Aim 2: the project will conduct a small randomized pilot of Estoy PrEParado to assess the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact of the intervention in moving immigrant Latino MSM along the PrEP cascade to initiation. In formative phase 1, the project will use the innovative and novel World Café approach to facilitate a community conversation with immigrant LMSM (n≈40) to validate, modify and refine the initial intervention content areas of the Estoy PrEParado pilot intervention. The World Café is a powerful conversational process for facilitating constructive group dialogue that produces ideas and knowledge that can be put into practice. The project will also elicit feedback and input on the contents of the intervention from a project-specific Intervention Advisory Committee (IAC) comprised of academic and community experts. In phase 2, the project will conduct a small randomized pilot of 80 participants (40 participants receiving the PrEP intervention and 40 participants receiving standard care, i.e., PrEP referrals) to establish feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact.

"Reducing Intersectional Stigma among High-Risk Women in Brazil to Promote Uptake of HIV Testing and PrEP PROJECT SUMMARY Globally, transgender (`trans') women experience extreme social and economic marginalization due to intersectional stigma, defined as the confluence of stigma that results from the intersection of social identities and positions among those who are multiply oppressed. Among trans women, gender-based stigma intersects with social positions such as engagement in sex work and substance use, as well as race-based stigma to generate a social context of vulnerability and increased risk of HIV acquisition. In Brazil, trans women are the `most-at-risk' group for HIV, with 55 times higher estimated odds of HIV infection than the general population; further, uptake of HIV testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among trans women is significantly lower than other at-risk groups, despite availability in the public sector and documented interest in the community. Through extensive formative work, we have developed a multi-level intervention utilizing HIV prevention strategies which have demonstrated feasibility and acceptability by trans women in Brazil, to address intersectional stigma and increase engagement of trans women in the HIV prevention continuum. We propose to test `Guerreiras' (`warrior women', as named by trans women participants in Brazil), comprised of two intervention components designed to address intersectional stigma: 1) a group-level, peer-led intervention and 2) an individual-level peer navigation program to increase uptake of HIV testing and PrEP. Guerreiras is informed by a trans-specific conceptual model, gender affirmation theory, that describes intersectional stigma faced by trans women, informs investigations of how intersectional stigma results in health disparities, and provides a framework for intervention development and testing. We will recruit trans women (N=400) from clinical sites, outreach events, and an observational cohort in São Paulo, Brazil. Guerreiras will be evaluated using a randomized wait-list controlled trial to compare HIV testing uptake (self-testing and clinic-based) (Aim 1), PrEP initiation and persistence (Aim 2), and other prevention services (e.g. harm reduction) among trans women in the intervention arm compared to those in the control arm with data collection scheduled every three months. We will assess changes in intersectional stigma (Aim 3), including reductions in internalized stigma and increased resilience to anticipated and enacted stigma, among those assigned to intervention compared to those assigned to control, and assess how changes in stigma domains result in prevention uptake. Outcomes will be monitored through the national medications dispensing system (PrEP initiation and persistence), clinical records and self-report (HIV testing), and through comprehensive surveys (intersectional stigma). The proposed research leverages a productive multi-disciplinary HIV research partnership with extensive experience working with trans women in Brazil, multi-level intervention components, and a context where PrEP and HIVST are available publicly, providing an opportunity to evaluate and scale-up an HIV prevention initiative in a key health disparity population, while contributing to nascent research in intersectional stigma. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed trial is grounded in a novel transgender-specific conceptual framework and is the culmination of decades of research in a population at high risk for HIV acquisition. Together, our investigative team has developed and piloted multiple, complementary intervention components to address intersectional stigma and increase engagement in the HIV prevention continuum among trans women in São Paulo, Brazil. The proposed intervention approach has the potential to optimize health outcomes in a population where intersectional stigma results in extreme health disparities and few proven effective interventions exist to date.",Reducing Intersectional Stigma among High-Risk Women in Brazil to Promote Uptake of HIV Testing and PrEP,10219381,R01MH121308,"['Brazil ', ' Communities ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Data Collection ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Names ', ' Public Sector ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Schedule ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' uptake ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' condoms ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' prevention service ', ' peer ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' outreach ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' social position ', ' social standing ', ' Social status ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' post intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' arm ', ' trans-women ', ' transwoman ', ' transwomen ', ' transgender women ', ' marginalization ', ' social exclusion ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' compare intervention ', ' comparison intervention ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,175744,0.11773825758352689
"Advancing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) access in pharmacies to improve PrEP uptake in disadvantaged areas Abstract Optimizing the reach of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) access for black men who have sex with men (BMSM) is critical to reduce racial inequities in HIV. The overall objective of this R34 application is to develop a culturally appropriate pharmacy PrEP delivery model and examine its feasibility, acceptability, and safety for BMSM who live in high poverty, racial minority neighborhoods. Cohen’s structural theory supports our central hypothesis that increased availability of PrEP screening and prescribing in neighborhoods where BMSM are most impacted by HIV will facilitate PrEP uptake. Findings from the proposed pilot study will support the long- term goal of this program of research, which is to implement an R01 cluster randomized efficacy trial in high poverty, racial minority neighborhoods to increase PrEP uptake among BMSM and reduce racial inequities in HIV. The aims of this R34 feasibility study are to: Aim 1) develop a pharmacy PrEP delivery model by evaluating the barriers to and facilitators of integrating PrEP into existing pharmacy practice among 40 key stakeholders (pharmacists, technicians, PrEP-prescribing physicians and BMSM) and Aim 2) pilot test the pharmacy PrEP delivery model and examine its feasibility, acceptability and safety, and gather early evidence of its impact and cost with respect to PrEP uptake at baseline and in 3-months among BMSM. To accomplish these aims we will conduct a formative phase of in-depth interviews among key stakeholders to inform the intervention development phase, which will establish a pharmacy PrEP delivery model with formalized input from an existing advisory board to be implemented in the pilot study phase among 2 community pharmacies, where we have existing relationships. Pharmacists (n=2) and technicians (n=6) will be trained using an adapted continuing education certified in-pharmacy HIV prevention training. They will complete semi-structured surveys over time (baseline, 3-month and 6-month) to assess the impact of the pharmacy PrEP intervention on pharmacy environment, personnel, and business flow. Social, behavioral surveys will be completed by 60 BMSM. We will follow behaviorally eligible BMSM, who complete their own biological screening in the pharmacy and receive PrEP (n=20) to determine PrEP uptake at 3-months. Development and refinement of this pharmacy PrEP delivery model is significant because it will lay the foundation for pharmacy-based PrEP access that reaches populations historically disconnected from HIV prevention resources. The innovation of this studies lies in its ability to shift the current paradigm of PrEP service delivery for BMSM by 1) creating a model that is achievable for most pharmacists even if they have limited pharmacy-level resources to screen men for PrEP, 2) employing a multi-level approach that examines the impact of the intervention on pharmacy staff and BMSM and 3) testing the use of self-screening in the pharmacy setting. Project Narrative. The proposed research will develop a culturally appropriate pharmacy PrEP delivery model and examine its feasibility, acceptability, and safety for black men who have sex with men (BMSM) who live in high poverty, racial minority neighborhoods.

"Promoting Reductions in Intersectional Stigma to Improve HIV Testing and PrEP Use Among Latino Sexual Minority Men PROJECT SUMMARY HIV prevention continuum disparities persist among Latinos in the U.S., especially those who are immigrants and sexual minority men (SMM). Latinos tend to be diagnosed with HIV (i.e., tested) at a later disease stage and use pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) at much lower rates than do Whites. However, of the existing evidence-based HIV prevention interventions, only one was developed for Latino SMM, and none have yet been developed or assessed for PrEP uptake. Based on the scientific premise and empirical evidence that stigma contributes meaningfully to HIV disparities, we propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an 8-session cognitive behavior therapy group intervention, Siempre Seguiré (“I will continue being”; named by community stakeholders after a popular song conveying gay empowerment), which aims to increase effective coping responses to stigma from intersectional identities (related to ethnicity, immigration status, and sexual minority identity) among Latino SMM, with the goal of improving HIV prevention continuum outcomes. Siempre Seguiré has a strong scientific basis in our prior pilot work, which found that the proposed intervention is acceptable to key stakeholders, feasible to conduct, and associated with improved effective coping and increased trust in providers and healthcare. The specific aims are: (1) To conduct a randomized controlled trial of Siempre Seguiré, a culturally congruent cognitive behavior therapy group intervention for immigrant Latino sexual minority men, to test intervention effects on regular HIV testing and PrEP uptake; (2) To examine mechanisms of intervention effects on regular HIV testing and PrEP uptake, including more effective coping (e.g., reduced internalized stigma, anticipated stigma, and medical mistrust); and (3) To conduct a cost- effectiveness analysis of the intervention. In the context of an established community-academic partnership, we will conduct the RCT with 300 immigrant Latino SMM, randomizing 150 to the intervention and 150 to an attention control group (a community-based wellness-oriented support group, with sessions matched to the intervention condition in number, timing, and length). Participants will complete surveys at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months post-baseline to assess the primary outcomes, potential mediators, covariates, and moderators. Regular HIV testing will be confirmed with official copies of HIV testing results, and PrEP uptake will be confirmed through copies of prescriptions, medical records, and urine testing. With the exception of our own work, we are not aware of any interventions that address coping with stigma from intersecting identities in order to improve health outcomes. Our research is consistent with Healthy People 2020, which recommends developing interventions to address effects of stigma among sexual minority individuals. Although structural- level interventions are critical for reducing societal stigma as a long-term strategy, individual-level interventions—such as Siempre Seguiré—are needed in tandem to reduce stigma’s immediate health effects. PROJECT NARRATIVE Latinos in the U.S., especially those who are immigrants and sexual minority men (SMM), are highly affected by HIV-related disparities, tending to be diagnosed at a later disease stage, leading to delays in antiretroviral treatment use and lower rates of viral suppression. No culturally congruent interventions have been developed to address intersectional HIV-related stigmas, a key contributor to disparities in the HIV prevention continuum among Latino SMM. We propose a randomized controlled trial of an 8-session cognitive behavior therapy group intervention that aims to increase regular HIV testing and PrEP uptake by increasing effective coping responses to intersectional stigmas from ethnicity, immigration status, sexual minority identity, HIV, and PrEP among Latino SMM.",Promoting Reductions in Intersectional Stigma to Improve HIV Testing and PrEP Use Among Latino Sexual Minority Men,9986038,R01MH121256,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immigration ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medical Records ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Names ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Research ', ' Support Groups ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Gays ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' programs ', ' Test Result ', ' Viral ', ' Services ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' empowerment ', ' Reporting ', ' acute stress ', ' Modeling ', ' psychoeducation ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' Institution ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Chronic stress ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Minority ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' sexual minority ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' attentional control ', ' intersectionalities ', ' intersectionality ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' ']",NIMH,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2020,718817,0.09646119037755754
"Following a U.S. National Cohort of Vulnerable Men to Improve HIV Prevention and Care Project Summary  RFA-AI-16-031 (LITE) is designed to address critical needs in HIV prevention research by using innovative technology to enroll and follow large-scale epidemiological cohorts of those at highest risk of infection. The proposed project will utilize established Internet-based strategies, previously used successfully by the research team, to enroll a sample of 5,000 high-risk HIV-negative gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM) ages 16 to 49—the population representing the highest percentage of new infections annually—and follow them prospectively for four years. The design features of our proposal were chosen specifically to: (a) identify individual-, network-, and contextual-level predictors and correlates of HIV seroconversion, (b) identify missed HIV prevention opportunities among those seroconverting during the course of the study, and, thus (c) inform interventions to further reduce acquisition and transmission.  We define “high-risk” as meeting CDC guidelines for PrEP treatment, but not taking PrEP. Participants will complete annual self-administered at-home rapid HIV testing (results submitted via digital photo of the test paddle) as well as brief (~20 min) at-home computerized surveys. In addition to being referred for treatment, study participants who seroconvert will complete a semi-structured telephone interview to identify missed HIV prevention opportunities and the contextual factors involved. We will monitor newly diagnosed participants' movement through the HIV care continuum. Based on current incidence rates, we anticipate accumulating ~252 infections during the study; however, because we are targeting high-risk men, this number could be higher. Aim 1 (UG3 Phase): Establish a cohort of 5,000 high-risk HIV-negative GBM who are not on PrEP, all of  whom complete baseline online surveys and at-home self-administered HIV testing, as well as consent for  longitudinal follow-up. Determine PrEP uptake and HIV incidence 12 months after study enrollment.  Supplemental Aims: Using the cross sectional data from GBM deemed ineligible during screening for study eligibility: Sup. Aim 1a—Estimate the uptake of PrEP; and Sup. Aim 1b—Characterize missed HIV  prevention opportunities (e.g., reasons for no prior PrEP use) among recent HIV seroconverters. Aim 2 (UH3 Phase): Follow the cohort for four years to characterize (2a) individual/network/contextual-level  determinants of PrEP uptake/discontinuation; (2b) new HIV seroconversions and missed HIV prevention  opportunities, including individual/network/contextual-level determinants; (2c) racial/ethnic disparities in  HIV incidence and their trends over time; and (2d) the influence of PrEP uptake on racial/ethnic disparities. Project Summary  This study will characterize HIV incidence and PrEP in a U.S. national sample of 5000 vulnerable men at risk for HIV. We will use technology-mediated methods to follow the sample for four years. Because participation in research studies that include frequent in-person contact with research personnel can impact participant behavior in ways that make them less representative of the high-risk populations from which they were drawn, we will utilize technological approaches to facilitate participation that are minimally invasive, and that incentivizes participation with nominal behavioral interference.",Following a U.S. National Cohort of Vulnerable Men to Improve HIV Prevention and Care,9985729,UH3AI133675,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Color ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Geography ', ' Hawthorne Effect ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Incentives ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Movement ', ' body movement ', ' Persons ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Self Administration ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' specimen collection ', ' sample collection ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' Gays ', ' uptake ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Test Result ', ' psychosocial ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' meetings ', ' innovative technologies ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' digital ', ' computerized ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' minimally invasive ', ' screening ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' seroconversion ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Time trend ', ' urban setting ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' infection risk ', ' ']",NIAID,GRADUATE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH POLICY,UH3,2020,1292196,0.25580151886755015
"UMass Amherst PREP Program PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The long-term goal of this project is to significantly increase the number of students from underrepresented groups who obtain PhD degrees in biomedical and biobehavioral fields. To this end, we will sponsor a one- year PREP internship that includes individualized programs of independent research, multi-tiered mentoring, and professional development with an interdisciplinary focus. The proposed activities are designed to increase the competitiveness of the PREP students for admission to rigorous biomedical graduate programs. Our project will capitalize on several unique strengths: A) Leadership of the Northeast Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NEAGEP), a highly interactive network of 15 institutions with demonstrated success in recruiting and retaining minority students in STEM PhD programs; B) Well-developed programs of interdisciplinary research and graduate education in biomedicine; C) Effective multi-level mentoring programs to support diversity at all levels of academia. We have hosted 63 PREP Scholars over the past 8 years. Of the 61 who applied, 96.8% were accepted, but nearly 15% chose to go to MD or professional MS programs. 85.3% of those who enrolled in PhD programs graduated within 6 years or are in good standing. This is a very high compared with the national 6-year completion rate of approximately 40% and 10-year completion of approximately 60% in similar disciplines. But, based on our self-study, we think it is feasible to reduce attrition at these stages even more. Therefore our aims are to: 1) Increase the percentage of PREP Scholars who enter PhD programs to at least 90% by:  a) Expanding our recruiting network to increase the number of applicants;  b) Revising our application and selection process to better identify students committed to research careers;  c) Fueling interest in earning PhD through activities of an intensive summer program that strengthens self-  identification as scientists, builds a cohesive community and immerses them in research. 2) Reduce the percentage of PREP Scholars who leave PhD programs to less than 10% by:  a) Enhancing our well-developed mentoring models by requiring specially developed mentoring workshops  for faculty who mentor PREP Scholars.  b) Conducting interactive, facilitated workshops wherein PREP Scholars and their mentors explore issues  confronted by minority students in majority institutions.  c) Continuing support of PREP Scholars after they enter graduate programs at UMA or elsewhere.

"Theoretically Based Mobile App to Increase PrEP Uptake Among MSM Abstract Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) holds great promise to reduce susceptibility to HIV infection for those who are HIV-negative and take PrEP regularly. However, PrEP initiation is serostatus dependent, and starting PrEP when risk emerges requires men who have sex with men (MSM) to maintain regular HIV testing routines and regularly assess PrEP eligibility. Currently many MSM do not test for HIV regularly, and PrEP uptake has been slow. PrEP will not have sufficient impact on HIV incidence among MSM unless it is brought to scale; PrEP coverage of 40-50% would be required to reduce HIV incidence by 25%. Today, PrEP uptake among MSM stands at 8.5%. We propose to test the efficacy of a mobile app (HealthMindr) to promote PrEP uptake in 3 US cities with substantial HIV epidemics among MSM: Atlanta, GA, Jackson, MS, and Washington, DC. The prevention app has already been developed and tested with 121 MSM; 9% of PrEP eligible MSM who used the app initiated PrEP during a 4-month follow-up period. Further, the app was found to be very acceptable to MSM. Minor enhancements to the PrEP component of the app will be made, including addition of additional PrEP information. The app will include components for self-administered risk assessments, developing and supporting a plan for frequent HIV testing, and monthly self-assessment for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) eligibility. The app will link those eligible for PrEP to services with a locator for PrEP providers, including private providers and details about services available, and with public PrEP navigators. The app will be tested in an RCT versus standard of care (referral to existing PrEP information and resources) in the three cities. The primary outcome will be rate of PrEP initiation, confirmed by tenofovir-diphosphate detection in a dried blood spot (DBS) specimen and/or photographic evidence of PrEP prescription. Project narrative A key issue for advancing comprehensive HIV prevention for MSM is how to increase PrEP uptake while sustaining high levels of HIV testing and condom use. We propose to evaluate the efficacy of a mobile application, HealthMindr, to increase PrEP uptake in the context of a package of basic prevention services for men who have sex with men in 3 US cities: Atlanta, GA, Jackson, MS, and Washington, DC.",Theoretically Based Mobile App to Increase PrEP Uptake Among MSM,9960476,R01DA045612,"['Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cities ', ' Counseling ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Minor ', ' Study models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Privatization ', ' Diphosphates ', ' Pyrophosphates ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Self Administration ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Suggestion ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Washington ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Individual ', ' uptake ', ' Spottings ', ' tool ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Viread ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' condoms ', ' prevention service ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' pill ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Detection ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' research clinical testing ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' active control ', ' Prevention Services Research ', ' cost ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' usability ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' standard of care ', ' efficacy testing ', ' surveillance study ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' ']",NIDA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,1056711,0.3756237476509248
"Onboarding Positives and PrEP users to Engage Negatives (OPPEN): peer-driven education to link YMSM of color to PrEP 100.7 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake has been slow among young men who have sex with men (YMSM), particularly those of color who experience a high rate of new HIV infections in the United States. Limited PrEP knowledge, unfamiliarity with how to access PrEP, medical mistrust, and stigma around HIV and sexuality are barriers to PrEP care engagement among YMSM, including those of color. Peer-driven social network interventions that train individuals as peer educators to disseminate information about HIV prevention and treatment within their social networks have been implemented to address similar barriers and improve HIV outcomes within hard to reach populations. YMSM of color engaged in HIV/PrEP care often employ resilience processes to overcome socio-structural barriers to HIV prevention and care. As such, training YMSM of color engaged in HIV/PrEP care as peer PrEP educators may position them as credible sources of PrEP information who can influence behavior change (i.e., PrEP care engagement) among YMSM peers of color within their social networks via their ability to disseminate culturally competent PrEP messages in the context of their personal experiences using these resilience processes to navigate the healthcare system, medical mistrust, and stigma. Drawing on existing peer-driven social network interventions, the diffusion of innovations and information-motivation-behavioral skills models, Harper et al.'s resilience framework, as well as data from our recent focus groups, the proposed R34 will develop and pilot Onboarding Positives and PrEP users to Engage Negatives (OPPEN), a peer-driven PrEP education social network intervention, among YMSM of color (Latino or Black) in San Diego, California. Through three small-group and two one-on-one sessions, OPPEN will train YMSM of color engaged in HIV/PrEP care to be peer PrEP educators within their social networks. In Phase I, OPPEN will be developed, pretested, and refined using an iterative process that integrates feedback from YMSM of color and interviews with HIV-positive and PrEP-using YMSM of color trained via OPPEN and YMSM peers of color within their social networks (AIM 1). In Phase II, OPPEN will be piloted in a randomized controlled trial with 70 YMSM of color engaged in HIV/PrEP care (i.e., indexes; 50% HIV-positive) randomly assigned to OPPEN (n=35) or a time- and attention-matched control condition (n=35). All indexes will receive coupons to recruit YMSM peers of color within their social networks to the study. Peers who present at the study site (i.e., peer-recruits) will undergo HIV testing. HIV-negative peer-recruits interested in PrEP will be scheduled for a PrEP clinic visit. Data collected via surveys (baseline and 3-month study visits) and medical records will be used to evaluate the preliminary effect of OPPEN on PrEP interest, linkage, and uptake among peer-recruits (AIM 2) and theory-based mechanisms targeted by OPPEN among indexes and peer-recruits (AIM 3). OPPEN acceptability and feasibility will be evaluated using a mixed-methods approach (AIM 4). Findings will be used to further refine OPPEN and inform a future R01 efficacy trial. 100.8 PROJECT NARRATIVE HIV incidence in the United States is highest among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) of color, but HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake has been low within this population. This study will develop the Onboarding Positives and PrEP users to Engage Negatives (OPPEN) intervention to train HIV-positive and PrEP-using YMSM of color to promote PrEP use among HIV-negative YMSM peers of color within their social networks. OPPEN will then be piloted to evaluate its acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effect on PrEP care engagement among YMSM of color.",Onboarding Positives and PrEP users to Engage Negatives (OPPEN): peer-driven education to link YMSM of color to PrEP,10012885,R34MH121234,"['Attention ', ' California ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Color ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sexuality ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Latino ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Schedule ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' uptake ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Baseline Surveys ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' Hour ', ' Source ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' resilience ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' data format ', ' YMSM ', ' young MSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' social structural ', ' socio-structural ', ' sociostructural ', ' social structure ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R34,2020,236375,0.2709142800243624
"kINSHIP: Peer navigators addressing INtersectional Stigma to improve HIV Prevention among criminal-justice involved women Project Summary/Abstract Stigma persists as a principle factor shaping HIV risk. Women involved in the criminal justice system have complex and highly stigmatized sexual and substance use risk profiles and are particularly vulnerable to, and experience, high rates of HIV. Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, is an efficacious HIV prevention strategy, however, women at high-risk of HIV infection in the United States (US) are largely absent from national efforts to improve PrEP awareness and uptake. Criminal justice settings represent an important opportunity to address disparities in HIV by linking high-risk women, who experience multiple, intersecting stigmas with innovative biomedical HIV prevention strategies, like PrEP. Peer-led patient navigation interventions have demonstrated efficacy in building trust and reducing stigma and discrimination-related barriers to healthcare engagement, and hold strong potential to address multiple, intersecting stigmas and other multifactorial and complex barriers to PrEP acceptability, linkage, and uptake for criminal justice involved women. As a multidisciplinary team with expertise in HIV clinical medicine and care cascade research, intersectionality, stigma, and behavioral health (substance use, mental health and HIV prevention) interventions for justice-involved populations, we propose to develop and test a peer-led patient navigator PrEP linkage intervention for women at risk for HIV acquisition who are on probation in San Francisco. Intervention development and study design will be guided by our team's pilot research, the Stigma and HIV Disparities Framework, and the PrEP Continuum of Care model. Study aims are to: 1) Determine the content and structure of a peer-led PrEP screening and linkage navigation intervention (Project kINSHIP) for high-risk CJI-women; 2) Refine and test the content and structure of the kINSHIP intervention for criminal justice involved women; and 3) Assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of the kINSHIP intervention on internalized stigma and the PrEP continuum of care in a pilot randomized trial. Formative qualitative work with key stakeholders, including women on probation, probation staff, and medical/public health staff in Aim 1 will guide intervention development and testing in Aim 2. In Aim 3, we will examine the primary outcome of PrEP service linkage and secondary outcomes such as time to linkage, PrEP prescription/initiation, and PrEP adherence/persistence. We will explore how intersectional stigma may moderate intervention effects on linkage to PrEP. The proposed study has the potential to: 1) reduce the impact of intersectional stigma as a barrier to service care engagement, 2) inform PrEP care continuum estimates for criminal justice-involved women as well as identify barriers, and 3) create an intervention suitable for large-scale efficacy testing and translation to other criminal justice settings.

"The Southern Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Cohort Study: Longitudinal PrEP Initiation and Adherence among Parolees PROJECT ABSTRACT The estimated HIV prevalence among criminal justice (CJ) involved individuals is three times higher than the general population. Parolees on post-release supervision after release experience multi-level obstacles (e.g., lack of access to housing, employment) that act as barriers to HIV prevention efforts, making existing approaches to HIV prevention insufficient for reducing HIV incidence. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a once daily medication (emtricitabine/tenofovir, FTC/TDF) that has demonstrated efficacy in preventing HIV among at-risk groups. Little is known about PrEP knowledge, acceptability, initiation, and sustained use among parolees recently released from prison or how these patterns vary by individual (HIV risk factor, sociodemographic characteristics), social (stigma, social support), and structural (housing, employment) factors. Therefore, we propose to conduct an observational, multi-site cohort study in North Carolina, Kentucky, and Florida—the Southern Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis [PrEP] Cohort Study among Parolees (SPECS-P). This study is guided by the Social Ecological Model and the NIMHD Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework, which both have a focus extending beyond the individual and acknowledge that multi-level (individual, social, and structural) factors play a role in the perpetuation of persistent health disparities. The specific aims of the proposed study are: 1) characterize PrEP knowledge and acceptability among parolees; 2) identify the multi-level factors that predict PrEP initiation and sustained use among parolees; 3) qualitatively assess the multi-level factors that affect PrEP acceptability, initiation and sustained use to inform future intervention development. The proposed project will be the first observational cohort study that includes a CJ involved population at extreme risk for HIV acquisition. Our study is aligned with the following high priority topics as defined by the NIH, NIMHD Science Visioning, and Office of AIDS Research: a) advancing evaluation of approaches to improve minority health or to reduce health disparities; and b) reducing incidence of HIV/AIDS and implementing strategies to improve entry into prevention services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Criminal justice involved individuals are at increased risk of HIV acquisition. Innovative HIV prevention strategies are urgently needed.

"A family-based intervention to improve HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake for adolescent sexual minority males PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. Rusley is pursuing this K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award to facilitate his transition to an independent HIV prevention scientist. His career goal is to eliminate health disparities among adolescents and young adults at risk for HIV. He has a background in pediatric and adolescent medicine, clinical research, public health, and motivational interviewing (MI) that create a strong foundation for the proposed training and research plan. He has assembled a highly accomplished and diverse team of mentors with complementary expertise in adolescent sexual minority male (ASMM) health, HIV prevention including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), behavioral interventions, family-based interventions, implementation science, and ethical issues in adolescent sexuality research. These mentors, along with an excellent and highly-interdisciplinary research environment at Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital will facilitate his training and research plan, as well as his transition to an independent, NIH- funded researcher. Given the disproportionate burden of HIV borne by sexual minority males in the US—especially young men—and the fact that most of these men have their first sexual experience as adolescents, ASMM are a key population for HIV prevention interventions. However, there are very few evidence-based HIV prevention interventions for this group, in part due to complexities with parental involvement in research. Many experts have called for inclusion of parents in HIV prevention interventions for ASMM, given the key protective roles they can play in their children’s lives; yet there are no family-based HIV prevention interventions for ASMM in the US. PrEP is a highly effective HIV prevention tool that has recently been added to the existing HIV prevention toolkit with FDA approval for adolescents in 2018, yet uptake among ASMM has been low. The few studies that address this gap in PrEP uptake among ASMM suggest possible barriers may include: concerns about disclosure of sexuality to parents (“outing”), knowledge of and motivation to use PrEP, and lack of access to primary care clinicians who prescribe PrEP. Therefore, we will develop a family-based HIV prevention intervention for ASMM that can be used in primary care settings. First, we will conduct a formative evaluation using in-depth individual interviews with ASMM (n=12-15) and parents (n=12-15) to determine barriers and facilitators to the success of the planned intervention (Specific Aim (SA) 1). Second, we will adapt an existing evidenced-based, motivational interviewing (MI) intervention to include PrEP education and counseling, as well as a family-based component (a video-based education module about parental support, sexuality communication, and PrEP as HIV prevention). We will then pilot the intervention with ASMM-parent dyads (n=10) (SA2). Finally, we will conduct an exploratory randomized trial of the intervention with ASMM-parent dyads (n=100) to test its effect on PrEP uptake at baseline and 8-week follow up, and to determine feasibility and acceptability (SA3). Overall, the intervention will reach a difficult to access population, build protective parent relationships, and increase PrEP uptake among a key population at risk, thereby reducing new HIV infections. The proposed training and research plan will provide Dr. Rusley the experience and mentoring needed to expand his skills and become an independent and leading HIV prevention scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescent sexual minority males are at higher risk than other groups for HIV infection in the United States; yet, there are few interventions focused on HIV prevention in this group, including those involving pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake. Importantly, parents are a main source of support for adolescents yet rarely included in research or interventions. Dr. Rusley will work with his mentor team to develop a family-based HIV prevention intervention that includes PrEP for adolescent sexual minority males, with the goal to decrease HIV transmission in

"Mhealth for Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Adherence by Young Adult MSM Abstract: Environment and Health Group, Tufts Infectious Disease Clinic, and Palmetto AIDS Life Support Services, will collaborate under the leadership of Patricia Weitzman, PhD, to develop and test the effectiveness of the first-ever individually-tailored, developmentally- and culturally-sensitive, mobile health (mhealth) PrEP adherence intervention called DOT. The intervention will target culturally-diverse, young adult men, ages 18-35, who have sex with men (YMSM). When the PrEP pill is taken daily, it can reduce HIV risk by 92-99%. The CDC estimates the daily PrEP pill is appropriate for 500,000 MSM in the U.S. Impact models show even modest increases in PrEP adherence could reduce new HIV infections among MSM by 29% over 20 years. The recent rise in HIV infection among young people, particularly minority YMSM, points to the value of PrEP uptake and adherence support for YMSM. In PrEP efficacy trials, younger age was the most consistent correlate with low PrEP adherence. Extensive mobile phone penetration among young adults makes mhealth an ideal, low-cost method for providing PrEP adherence support to culturally-diverse YMSM. Our DOT mhealth intervention reflects a developmental understanding of young adult decision-making, and is uniquely combined with principles from social cognitive theory, positive psychology and behavioral economics, all toward the goal of supporting PrEP adherence. The proposed project is based on Dr. Weitzman's successful Phase 1 trial of DOT, which led to significant improvements in PrEP adherence, PrEP treatment self-efficacy, and intention to follow PrEP treatment guidelines among the YMSM that used DOT for six weeks. Our proposed Phase 2 DOT mhealth intervention is directly responsive to Phase 1 findings by adding recommended new features and enhancements, including: 1) new texts targeting stress burden 2) new online community for social support 3) new linkage to the federal crisis text line 4) new gamification via a virtual avatar 5) new automatic time-zone adjustments 6) new cloud-based platform to view user engagement 7) new calendar for clinic appointments and pharmacy refills 8) enhanced personalization of pill reminders and 9) enhanced adherence graphing designed for sharing with healthcare providers. In Phase 2, we will test the effectiveness of DOT at improving PrEP adherence in a randomized controlled trial. Our goal is to help stop the rise in HIV among YMSM. Another potential benefit of DOT is advancement of the evidence base on how mhealth might address patient support issues in HIV prevention and other healthcare concerns toward the larger goal of reducing health disparities. Narrative  The proposed Phase 2 project aims to enhance and test a mobile health intervention designed to increase adherence to the daily PrEP pill among culturally-diverse young adult men who have sex with men. The intervention will include: a) personalized PrEP pill reminders b) culturally- and developmentally-sensitive text messages targeting patient education, motivation, and stress c) a gamification avatar and d) a linked online community of peers. Effectively promoting PrEP adherence would reduce new HIV infections in this at-risk population, which is subject to health disparities.",Mhealth for Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Adherence by Young Adult MSM,10008519,R44MH112221,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Appointment ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Control Groups ', ' Decision Making ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Environment ', ' Feedback ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Factor One ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Leadership ', ' Marketing ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Motivation ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Privacy ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Intention ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Penetration ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' uptake ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Clinic ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Graph ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' pill ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Intake ', ' Calendar ', ' Cognitive ', ' sex ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' truvada ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' cost ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' commercialization ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' health equity ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' cloud based ', ' behavioral economics ', ' phase 1 trial ', ' phase I trial ', ' on-line community ', ' virtual community ', ' online community ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' treatment guidelines ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NIMH,"ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH GROUP, INC.",R44,2020,466130,0.3080463376132137
"Reducing Intersectional Stigma among High-Risk Women in Brazil to Promote Uptake of HIV Testing and PrEP PROJECT SUMMARY Globally, transgender (`trans') women experience extreme social and economic marginalization due to intersectional stigma, defined as the confluence of stigma that results from the intersection of social identities and positions among those who are multiply oppressed. Among trans women, gender-based stigma intersects with social positions such as engagement in sex work and substance use, as well as race-based stigma to generate a social context of vulnerability and increased risk of HIV acquisition. In Brazil, trans women are the `most-at-risk' group for HIV, with 55 times higher estimated odds of HIV infection than the general population; further, uptake of HIV testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among trans women is significantly lower than other at-risk groups, despite availability in the public sector and documented interest in the community. Through extensive formative work, we have developed a multi-level intervention utilizing HIV prevention strategies which have demonstrated feasibility and acceptability by trans women in Brazil, to address intersectional stigma and increase engagement of trans women in the HIV prevention continuum. We propose to test `Guerreiras' (`warrior women', as named by trans women participants in Brazil), comprised of two intervention components designed to address intersectional stigma: 1) a group-level, peer-led intervention and 2) an individual-level peer navigation program to increase uptake of HIV testing and PrEP. Guerreiras is informed by a trans-specific conceptual model, gender affirmation theory, that describes intersectional stigma faced by trans women, informs investigations of how intersectional stigma results in health disparities, and provides a framework for intervention development and testing. We will recruit trans women (N=400) from clinical sites, outreach events, and an observational cohort in São Paulo, Brazil. Guerreiras will be evaluated using a randomized wait-list controlled trial to compare HIV testing uptake (self-testing and clinic-based) (Aim 1), PrEP initiation and persistence (Aim 2), and other prevention services (e.g. harm reduction) among trans women in the intervention arm compared to those in the control arm with data collection scheduled every three months. We will assess changes in intersectional stigma (Aim 3), including reductions in internalized stigma and increased resilience to anticipated and enacted stigma, among those assigned to intervention compared to those assigned to control, and assess how changes in stigma domains result in prevention uptake. Outcomes will be monitored through the national medications dispensing system (PrEP initiation and persistence), clinical records and self-report (HIV testing), and through comprehensive surveys (intersectional stigma). The proposed research leverages a productive multi-disciplinary HIV research partnership with extensive experience working with trans women in Brazil, multi-level intervention components, and a context where PrEP and HIVST are available publicly, providing an opportunity to evaluate and scale-up an HIV prevention initiative in a key health disparity population, while contributing to nascent research in intersectional stigma. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed trial is grounded in a novel transgender-specific conceptual framework and is the culmination of decades of research in a population at high risk for HIV acquisition. Together, our investigative team has developed and piloted multiple, complementary intervention components to address intersectional stigma and increase engagement in the HIV prevention continuum among trans women in São Paulo, Brazil. The proposed intervention approach has the potential to optimize health outcomes in a population where intersectional stigma results in extreme health disparities and few proven effective interventions exist to date.",Reducing Intersectional Stigma among High-Risk Women in Brazil to Promote Uptake of HIV Testing and PrEP,9995595,R01MH121308,"['Brazil ', ' Communities ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Data Collection ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Names ', ' Public Sector ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Schedule ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' uptake ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' condoms ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' prevention service ', ' peer ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' outreach ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' social position ', ' social standing ', ' Social status ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' post intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' arm ', ' trans-women ', ' transwoman ', ' transwomen ', ' transgender women ', ' marginalization ', ' social exclusion ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' compare intervention ', ' comparison intervention ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,670468,0.11773825758352689
"Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program ""PREP@UAZ"" Program Summary/Abstract American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) are the most underrepresented racial/ethnic group among scientists in the U.S. One reason for their low representation is the cultural difference between Indigenous and Euro-American-based science, which can lead to a feeling of isolation for AI/AN students. The vision of Indigenous1 scholars within higher education and the long-term goal of the proposed University of Arizona Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (UA PREP) is to overcome these differences and increase the participation of AI/AN students in biomedical research. Due to its close proximity to many Tribal or AI/AN communities, the richness of its biomedical and behavioral research enterprise, and an institutional-level commitment to diversity and inclusion, UA is well-positioned for a PREP program. Further, UA ranks first among U.S. research-intensive universities in conferring PhD degrees to AI/AN students. The premise of the proposed PREP is that nurturing overall well-being and honoring Indigenous science knowledge while offering AI/AN students a doctoral-level research experience will provide the best foundation for success in graduate school. The current proposal seeks to provide five to eight UA PREP participants per year with an intensive research experience and additional training to enhance their competitiveness for doctoral programs. Strategic partnerships with minority-serving institutions and with programs at UA that support AI/AN undergraduates in STEM fields will be utilized to support recruitment efforts. The program will focus on students who have encountered greater than average challenges on their path to graduate school. Participants will spend 75% of their time conducting hypothesis-driven, doctoral-level research. The proposed activities for the remaining 25% of the participants' efforts will provide career development training. The matriculation and retention of AI/AN students in graduate programs will be increased by nurturing a sense of belonging within the community of science while honoring Indigenous knowledge. We aim to have at least 75% of the trainees matriculate into biomedical PhD programs. Their retention and success in these programs will be enhanced by foundations laid in UA PREP. Participants will be encouraged to incorporate their cultural values into their individual development plans. Further, program activities will nurture community engagement with frequent opportunities to interact with Native and non-Native science faculty and graduate students. The capacity of UA to train AI/AN graduate students will be fostered through annual workshops aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of faculty in mentoring students and increasing cultural sensitivity and awareness of and integration of Indigenous science methods into the curriculum. A selection committee of research-active mentors will recommend the strongest applicants to UA PREP for approval by the Institutional Advisory Committee. This committee and an expert external evaluator will regularly assess progress towards the UA PREP program objectives. 1Indigenous and Native American are used here, respectively, for Indigenous groups internationally and in the U.S. 1 Project Narrative American Indians/Alaskan Natives (AI/AN) are the most underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities in the biomedical sciences. The University of Arizona Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (UA PREP) seeks to provide AI/AN students with a rigorous research and educational program that honors Indigenous perspectives and nurtures a strong sense of well-being and belonging. This program will enhance the confidence and success of participants and their matriculation into strong biomedical PhD programs and subsequently increase the diversity of PhD-level scientists.","Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program ""PREP@UAZ""",9854989,R25GM121228,"['Affect ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Arizona ', ' Awareness ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Colorado ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Montana ', ' New Mexico ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Reflex action ', ' Reflex ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Wisconsin ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Trainers Training ', ' Vocation ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' role model ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Native Americans ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Published Comment ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Feels well ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' psychological wellness ', ' self wellness ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' Well in self ', ' System ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Alaska Native ', ' graduate student ', ' cultural values ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Indigenous ', ' International ', ' NIGMS ', ' National Institute of General Medical Sciences ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' minority institution ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' STEM class ', ' STEM course ', ' STEM discipline ', ' STEM major ', ' science, technology, engineering and math class ', ' science, technology, engineering and math course ', ' science, technology, engineering and math discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and math field ', ' science, technology, engineering and math major ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics class ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics course ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics discipline ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics field ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics major ', ' STEM field ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' Complex thinking ', ' Evaluative Thinking ', ' Critical Thinking ', ' student-led learning ', ' student mentoring ', ' faculty research ', ' peer instruction ', ' peer led team learning ', ' peer mentoring ', ' peer teaching ', ' peer coaching ', ' higher education ', ' matriculation ', ' education research ', ' Cultural Sensitivity ', ' Student recruitment ', ' nonnative ', ' non-Native ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R25,2020,321710,0.2805779903306428
"Implementation of PrEP for Women Who Inject Drugs through Practice Facilitation in Primary and Reproductive Health Care PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The goal of this research is to prevent HIV among women who inject drugs (WWID) through organization-level change in the way pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is delivered to this population. Dr. Starbird is proposing a research and career development plan which will prepare her to independently evaluate system-level interventions to improve care delivery to WWID with high capacity for implementation. WWID are among the most vulnerable to acquiring HIV due to the dual effects of both unsafe injecting and sexual practices. PrEP is effective and recommended to prevent HIV infection among high-risk groups, including WWID. However, PrEP uptake among WWID is lagging – 92% of people who receive PrEP in New York State are men. Interventions at the organizational level present an opportunity to improve PrEP delivery and decrease gender disparities among people who inject drugs, particularly in primary and reproductive healthcare settings which can engage WWID in ongoing PrEP use when they present for comorbidity management, psychosocial services, or pregnancy support. Including PrEP for WWID in often under-resourced and stretched primary and reproductive healthcare settings poses organizational challenges that may be eliminated with Practice Facilitation. Practice Facilitation is an evidence-based strategy to support clinics' abilities to implement an intervention such as PrEP through technical assistance, logistical support, and external partnership building. This study will leverage NIDA's investment in the HEALing Communities Study in New York State (UM1 DA049415, PI: El-Bassel, primary mentor) to achieve the following specific aims: 1) explore the opinions of WWID about how PrEP is delivered to them, 2) examine the provider- and organization- level barriers and facilitators to delivering PrEP to WWID, and 3) adapt and pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of Practice Facilitation to improve PrEP delivery to WWID in primary and reproductive healthcare settings. We hypothesize that PrEP Practice Facilitation will be feasible and acceptable to primary and reproductive healthcare organizations and demonstrate potential to increase the proportion of WWID who receive a prescription for PrEP. Dr. Starbird has contributed to understanding the efficacy, effectiveness, and economic implications of interventions for individuals with substance use disorder, HIV, and hepatitis C. This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award builds on this experience and extends it with training in four key skills: 1) advanced qualitative analysis, 2) organizational behavior change, 3) implementation science, and 4) ethical conduct of research with vulnerable women. The proposed K01 will provide training, mentorship, and research experience that will serve as the foundation for Dr. Starbird's career as an independent investigator dedicated to improving healthcare delivery for marginalized populations. This project is well-aligned with the strategic objectives of NIDA and also directly in line with the Office of AIDS Research cross-cutting areas of Health Disparities and Implementation Science Research to reduce the incidence of HIV. PROJECT NARRATIVE Women who inject drugs are among the most vulnerable to acquiring HIV, but very few women who inject drugs are prescribed pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention largely due to barriers within our healthcare system. This research will consider the perspectives of women who inject drugs, healthcare providers, and clinic leadership to improve the way primary care and reproductive health clinics deliver PrEP to women who inject drugs, thereby reducing new HIV infections in this population. The research and training in this application will prepare the candidate for an independent scientific career conducting intervention research among vulnerable populations with high capacity for

"Optimizing an IMB-guided intervention to support HIV self-testing and PrEP uptake among YMSM: A pilot factorial RCT PROJECT SUMMARY Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV, and more than 70% of HIV infections among youth (≤ 24 years old) occur among young MSM (YMSM). US Food and Drug Administration approved oral fluid rapid HIV self-testing (HIVST) devices provide a critical route for reducing barriers to HIV testing; however, uptake of HIVST among YMSM has been slow to date and no known studies have explored barriers and facilitators to HIVST among YMSM using rigorous mixed-methods procedures. YMSM who engage in HIVST are also good candidates for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), but PrEP uptake among YMSM has been minimal to date. The Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model is an empirically supported framework for HIV prevention, which can be applied to the barriers and facilitators related to HIVST and PrEP uptake. An IMB-guided mHealth intervention is a promising strategy to increase HIVST and PrEP uptake, offering participant confidentiality and potential scaling of an efficient intervention. Despite the promise of this type of theoretically-guided intervention, little is known about the independent effects of each IMB model construct on HIVST and PrEP uptake. To support intervention development, we will conduct mixed-methods formative research to explore IMB-related barriers and facilitators to HIVST and PrEP uptake among YMSM using data collected via online focus groups (n = 12; 96-144 individuals) with YMSM nationwide and a national survey of YMSM (n = 500; i.e., Aim 1). We will then pilot an IMB-factorial mHealth intervention to increase HIVST and post-test PrEP uptake tailored for YMSM, assessing feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact at 3-month follow-up (i.e., Aim 2). The intervention will be reviewed by an online youth advisory board and beta-tested with 12 YMSM. We will then pilot the clinical trial with 120 YMSM randomized to one of four groups using a factorial randomized experimental design, allowing us to determine which IMB model construct(s) are most important to increase HIVST and PrEP uptake. The four arms of this randomized controlled trial will be information-only (I), information + motivation (IM), information + behavioral skills (IB), and full IMB model (IMB). Dried blood spot sampling will be used to measure PrEP uptake and adherence. The training plan of this K01 award is designed to facilitate Dr. Steven A. John's transition to an independent investigator. Specifically, Dr. John will: (1) develop skills in mixed-methods research including advanced training in qualitative research methods, (2) build content expertise in mHealth interventions for HIV prevention, and (3) gain expertise in translating formative work into efficacy trials with supplemental training in quantitative analysis and implementation science. Additional training in responsible and ethical conduct in research and a focus on career enhancement and professional development will accompany the three primary training goals. The training plan includes didactic coursework, independent study, training institutes, academic conferences, manuscript preparation, grant writing, and other research activities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV, and more than 70% of HIV infections among youth (≤ 24 years old) occur among young MSM (YMSM). An mHealth intervention guided by the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model is a promising strategy to increase HIV self-testing (HIVST) and uptake of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among YMSM aged 17-24 years old.

"Longitudinal Predictors of PrEP Use and Adherence Among Young Black MSM Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) dramatically reduces the risk of HIV infection, especially for those who are most adherent. However, for PrEP to significantly impact the HIV epidemic, those most at risk of HIV must both use and adhere to PrEP. Data suggest that a substantial proportion of men who have sex with men (MSM) stop using PrEP soon after starting; they may or may not resume use. There is also evidence that many young men may not consistently adhere to PrEP. However, we know very little about the frequency of PrEP termination, gaps in PrEP use, or lapses in prevention-effective adherence among young Black MSM (YBMSM), or about short- and long-term changes in use and adherence for these men. Additionally, we lack information about how use and adherence among YBMSM may be impacted by structural and psychosocial barriers to PrEP (including issues with health care access and insurance; low socioeconomic status and instability in employment, transportation, and housing; poor mental health; substance use; and stigma and negative social norms related to PrEP) or partner and relationship factors (such as the introduction of new partners, the development of committed relationships, perceptions of partner risk, and intimate partner violence). The overall aim of the proposed research is to use short- and long-term prospective, longitudinal data from YBMSM PrEP users to examine patterns and predictors of PrEP use and adherence, with the goal of identifying targets for PrEP interventions with this high-risk population. We will recruit 200 YBMSM (ages 18- 30) who use PrEP from Midwestern metro areas with large racial disparities in HIV (Detroit, MI; Kansas City, MO; Milwaukee, WI; and Minneapolis, MN). Men will complete surveys assessing PrEP use and adherence along with hypothesized predictors every 3 months for 1 year. Additionally, a subsample of 100 users will complete 14 days of electronic daily diaries to assess micro changes in adherence, other sexual health and risk behaviors, and key predictors. Dried blood spot tests for tenofovir will be used to objectively assess adherence, and information on HIV and STI testing and infection will be drawn from linked medical records. Through the application of modern analytic methods, this research will address the following aims: (1) Describe longitudinal changes in PrEP use and adherence among YBMSM, and associations between PrEP use and adherence and other sexual health and risk behaviors and outcomes; (2) Identify factors associated with gaps in PrEP use, PrEP termination, and poor PrEP adherence for YBMSM over 1 year; and (3) Identify factors associated with PrEP adherence at the daily level for YBMSM using daily diary surveys. We predict that gaps in PrEP use, PrEP termination, and lapses in prevention-effective adherence will be common, and that they will be associated with structural and psychosocial barriers as well as sexual partner and relationship factors. Information on how and why use and adherence vary over time will inform the development of interventions targeting PrEP uptake and adherence among YBMSM. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) dramatically reduces the risk of HIV infection, especially for those who are most adherent. However, there is evidence that a substantial proportion of men who have sex with men (MSM) stop using PrEP soon after starting, and that many users, especially young Black MSM, may not take PrEP consistently. This research will collect longitudinal survey and daily diary data from young Black MSM who use PrEP in four mid-sized Midwestern cities with large HIV disparities in order to identify changes in PrEP use and adherence over time; barriers and sexual partner factors associated with gaps in PrEP use, PrEP termination, and poor PrEP adherence; and predictors of PrEP adherence at the daily level.

"Improving Prevention Systems to Reduce Disparities for High Priority Populations. 7. PROJECT SUMMARY This project collaborates with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) to develop and test a field-based comprehensive sexual health intervention for HIV-exposed contacts notified by its Partner Services (i.e., HIV contact tracing) program. Individuals reached by PS programs are highest priority for linkage to HIV prevention/care services: 10-20% are newly diagnosed with HIV as a result of PS notification and the remainder are eligible and high priority for PrEP. Because they seek out highest-risk individuals in the field, PS programs have the potential to significantly reduce existing disparities in PrEP uptake and timely HIV care initiation by reaching populations that are currently under-engaged by traditional PrEP or HIV testing programs. The new Partner Services-Sexual Health (PS-SH) intervention offers a comprehensive sexual health package that includes HIV testing, STI testing, ARV/PrEP education and immediate medication start to all individuals receiving contact notification (i.e., being notified of a recent exposure to HIV). NYCDOHMH is collaborating on this research project to enable a scientifically rigorous test of the intervention’s efficacy and produce the highest quality data on implementation dynamics, cost-effectiveness, and affordability to inform dissemination and adaptation of the intervention, should it prove effective. The specific aims are to: (1) Pilot and refine a field-based comprehensive sexual health intervention delivered through the NYC DOHMH Partner Services Program. Under this aim, we will pilot the intervention in five highest prevalence NYC neighborhoods for 6-months (n = ~60), examine feasibility and acceptability, and refine the intervention process and protocols for the trial to test effectiveness at scale. (2) Examine the effectiveness of the Partner Services-Sexual Health (PS-SH) intervention in improving rates of HIV testing, linkage to HIV prevention/care, and PrEP uptake among highest risk contacts recently exposed to HIV. Under this aim, we will conduct a cross-sectional stepped wedge cluster randomized trial in which 12 clusters of NYC neighborhoods are exposed to the intervention sequentially, with three clusters moving from control to intervention every 6 months (n = 1150). Primary outcomes are HIV testing, timely PrEP/ARV uptake, and linkage to PrEP/HIV care. Secondary outcomes are STD testing and receipt of STD treatment (if indicated). (3) Conduct preliminary analyses of economic outcomes, including cost-allocation and affordability to allow other jurisdictions to make decisions about implementation. These analyses will include per-outcome cost-estimates, and will develop a blueprint for economic evaluation of the intervention including incremental cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses for application locally and nationally. The proposed project is poised to have a significant and sustained impact on the field by: a) addressing a critical gap in the prevention/care continuum to reduce persistent disparities in the epidemic; and b) pioneering a collaborative implementation science approach to accelerate the dissemination of evidence-based practice models across the United States and internationally. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe disparities in PrEP access and uptake remain among populations most strongly impacted by the HIV epidemic. These same populations suffer from disproportionately high rates of undiagnosed infection and late treatment initiation that translate into high levels of HIV-related mobility and mortality.

"Offering women PrEP with education, shared decision-making and trauma-informed care: the OPENS trial PROJECT SUMMARY  Although 13% of the U.S. female population is Black, 60% of new HIV diagnoses in U.S. women are in Black women. The South is the epicenter of the U.S. HIV epidemic, including in women, and Black Southern women are disproportionately affected: Black women account for 69% of new HIV diagnoses in women in the South. As the first highly effective, discrete, woman-controlled HIV prevention method, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine radically expands HIV prevention options for women. However, uptake of PrEP in U.S. women has lagged, particularly among groups most affected by HIV. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates 468,000 women in the U.S. are eligible for PrEP, but only approximately 19,000 have ever been prescribed PrEP. Moreover, despite disparities in incident HIV in U.S. women, White women are 4 times more likely to have received PrEP than Black women.  PrEP cascades outline the necessary steps for accessing PrEP, including screening and identifying eligible individuals, linkage to care, prescription and initiation of PrEP. Data suggest there are multilevel barriers related to the process of screening for HIV risk in women and identifying potential PrEP candidates that may drive a significant drop off early in the PrEP cascade for women. The objective of this proposal is to improve mechanisms of offering PrEP to women through use of a patient-level intervention—an HIV prevention decision support tool (DST); a provider-level intervention—training on shared decision-making; and a clinic-level intervention--training on trauma-informed care, with the goal of ultimately mitigating disparities in the HIV epidemic in women by increasing PrEP uptake in Southern U.S. women of color.  This study will occur at 2 reproductive health clinics in Duval County, Florida, were HIV incidence in women is high. In Aim 1, participants will be randomized to an HIV prevention DST coupled with standard counseling or standard counseling alone to evaluate the effect of the DST on PrEP prescriptions as well as patient experiences of PrEP care and counseling. In Aim 2, a 3-phase approach will be used to evaluate how provider training on shared decision making and clinic-wide training on trauma-informed care affect patient counseling and decision making about PrEP. Baseline data collected in Phase 1 will be compared to data collected after the trainings without use of the DST (Phase 2), and to data collected after the trainings with use of the DST (Phase 3). Data collection in each 3-month phase will include chart extraction on PrEP prescriptions, exit surveys with women about HIV prevention choices and quality of counseling, audio-taped counseling sessions, and interviews with women of color to explore experiences of HIV prevention counseling and care. In the final aim, the feasibility of disseminating the multilevel interventions described in Aims 1&2 will be assessed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, providing preliminary data on implementation. Narrative There are striking racial and regional disparities in HIV diagnoses in women in the U.S., as well as in utilization of effective HIV prevention methods such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention. Reasons for these disparities are multifactorial, and require multi-level interventions to address them. The objective of this study is to improve mechanisms of identifying women vulnerable to HIV in the Southern U.S. and offer them comprehensive HIV prevention methods, including PrEP, through use of a patient-level intervention—offering universal education about PrEP via an HIV prevention decision support tool--a provider-level intervention— training on shared decision-making—and a clinic-level intervention--training on trauma-informed care— ultimately mitigating disparities in the HIV epidemic in women by increasing PrEP uptake in Southern U.S. women of color.","Offering women PrEP with education, shared decision-making and trauma-informed care: the OPENS trial",9892890,R01MD013565,"['Affect ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Color ', ' Family Planning ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Collection ', ' Decision Making ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' Florida ', ' Fumarates ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Privatization ', ' Qualitative Evaluations ', ' Quantitative Evaluations ', ' Risk ', ' Self Assessment ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' uptake ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Knowledge ', ' Viread ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Oral ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' Reporting ', ' Contraception ', ' Fertility Control ', ' Inhibition of Fertilization ', ' Contraceptive methods ', ' HIV risk ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', "" beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine "", ' emtricitabine ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Drops ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' implementation research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Trauma ', ' Coupled ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' primary outcome ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' support tools ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' provider barriers ', ' provider-level barriers ', ' system-level barriers ', ' implementation strategy ', ' clinical encounter ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,469972,0.32942067971199324
"Characterizing PrEP Adherence and Patterns of Use in a Diverse Community Cohort of Young Men Project Summary Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) are at high risk for HIV–particularly YMSM of color. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is extremely effective at reducing HIV transmission. Uptake has been lower than anticipated, but is increasing rapidly–though less so among Black YMSM. PrEP effectiveness hinges upon adherence, but levels of adherence vary and tend to be lower among Black individuals and youth. Adherence to daily PrEP does not need to be perfect to obtain benefit–in the iPrEx open-label extension, taking 2-3 doses/week was 84% efficacious (4+ was 100% efficacious)–and non-daily dosing strategies are also under investigation (event- and time-driven dosing). Beyond adherence, patterns of use are critically important. Oral PrEP is unlikely to be a life-long strategy for most, and evidence suggests that many YMSM discontinue PrEP (particularly Black and Latino YMSM), but most discontinuers report continued HIV risk behaviors. Further, studies are beginning to examine episodic PrEP use during discrete periods of highest HIV risk. Finally, risk compensation (i.e., decreased condom use after initiating PrEP) is a crucial component of PrEP effectiveness as it may maintain, or even increase, HIV transmission if adherence is not optimal. The goal of the current proposal is to characterize PrEP adherence across dosing strategies, describe patterns of use (continuous, episodic, discontinuation), and examine racial differences in adherence and patterns of use. We will embed novel mixed-methods research into RADAR, a diverse cohort of YMSM (N>1,200; age 16-29) assessed every 6 months (U01DA036939). We propose to add a daily diary study of PrEP users to characterize adherence and patterns of use, biomarkers of adherence to objectively measure PrEP coverage, and in-depth interviews with PrEP users to understand contextual influences on these issues. Aim 1: Describe PrEP adherence, dosing strategies, and usage patterns among YMSM. We will conduct a 3-month daily diary study with 120 YMSM PrEP users from RADAR to: a) characterize patterns of PrEP dosing strategies (daily, time-driven, event- driven), adherence, and usage patterns (continuous, episodic, discontinuation); b) Examine whether PrEP adherence or dosing strategies are associated with self-reported sexual risk behavior and STI infection; and c) describe racial differences in PrEP adherence, dosing strategies, and risk compensation. Aim 2: Assess associations between usage patterns and long- and short-term concentrations of PrEP in red blood cells. We will collect dried blood spot samples once per month during the diary study (3x) to assess concentrations of tenofovir-diphosphate and embtricitabine-triphosphate. Aim 3: Characterize YMSM perspectives on adherence, usage patterns, and risk compensation. We will conduct in-depth interviews with 60 YMSM diary study participants to understand individual, interpersonal, and structural influences on PrEP adherence and patterns of use, with an emphasis on understanding racial differences. Data from this study will inform the development of public health messaging and behavioral interventions to improve PrEP effectiveness among diverse YMSM. Project Narrative Young men who have sex with men (YMSM), particularly YMSM of color, are at high risk for HIV infection. Pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective at reducing HIV transmission but is reliant on optimal adherence and sustained use during periods of high risk. This proposal aims to characterize PrEP adherence and patterns of use in a diverse community cohort of YMSM by integrating a 3-month daily diary study, biomarkers of adherence, and in-depth interviews with PrEP users into the larger cohort study.",Characterizing PrEP Adherence and Patterns of Use in a Diverse Community Cohort of Young Men,9892888,R01MD013609,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Erythrocytes ', ' Blood erythrocyte ', ' Erythrocytic ', ' Marrow erythrocyte ', ' Red Blood Cells ', ' Red Cell ', ' blood corpuscles ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Methods ', ' Public Health ', ' Diphosphates ', ' Pyrophosphates ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' triphosphate ', ' tripolyphosphate ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' improved ', ' Compensation ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' Spottings ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Viread ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Oral ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' cohort ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' trend ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' open label study ', ' open label ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' protective effect ', ' men at high risk ', ' high risk men ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' adolescent man ', ' adolescent men ', ' young man ', ' YMSM ', ' young MSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' sex risk behavior ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' anal intercourse without condom ', ' anal sex without condom ', ' condomless anal intercourse ', ' unprotected anal intercourse ', ' unprotected anal sex ', ' unsafe anal intercourse ', ' unsafe anal sex ', ' condomless anal sex ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,496721,0.32403117474900517
"PrEP Up!: Understanding PrEP stigma to improve uptake among men who have sex with men Project Summary/Abstract Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV in Guatemala. While national level adult HIV prevalence is less than 1.0%, the most recent prevalence estimate among MSM is 10.5%. This dramatic HIV disparity suggests that current prevention strategies are not sufficient. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) with daily tenofovir/emtricitabine safely provides high levels of protection against HIV infection if taken correctly and has expanded the HIV prevention landscape. Global PrEP uptake has been slower than expected, however, and PrEP acceptability among men who have sex with men (MSM) is only 58%. Promoting PrEP requires innovative, tailored approaches grounded in contextualized understanding of the social context and lived experiences of potential users. Among MSM, multiple levels of intersecting stigma related to HIV and sexual orientation can deter PrEP initiation. PrEP stigma, which includes negative stereotypes of PrEP users as having HIV and/or being irresponsible and promiscuous, also greatly inhibits PrEP acceptability and uptake. More research on levels and manifestations of PrEP stigma are needed to inform global PrEP promotion efforts. Mobile Health (mHealth) interventions, in particular smartphone applications (apps), can be used to mitigate stigma. The accessibility, affordability, flexibility, and anonymity of smartphones make them a highly appealing medium for engaging MSM and addressing PrEP stigma. Further, smartphone interventions address issues such as transportation logistics, stigma, and confidentiality, all of which are barriers to sexual health services among MSM in Guatemala. While still a nascent field, early evidence, including work by our team, suggests that smartphone apps can address stigma as a barrier to health promotion among MSM by providing information and cultivating social support. Our community research partner, Colectivo Amigos Contra el SIDA (CAS), opened the first community-based PrEP clinic in Latin America in January 2016 and is now planning to scale up coverage. This scale up creates a crucial need for information on barriers to PrEP acceptability and uptake and a unique opportunity to explore PrEP stigma in the lives of MSM. The proposed R21 aims to assess the role of stigma in PrEP acceptability to inform the design of mHealth PrEP promotion strategies through a bidirectional process of research capacity building with UNC and CAS. In Aim 1, we will determine the association between PrEP stigma and PrEP acceptability among MSM using a mixed methods approach. We will conduct qualitative in-depth interviews (n=20) and a structured survey (n=200) to obtain multiple perspectives on PreP acceptability, PrEP stigma, and smartphone use and preferences. For Aim 2, we will assess how MSM in Guatemala interact in online discussions and exchange social support related to PrEP through online focus groups discussions. For Aim 3, we will evaluate strategies to promote uptake of and engagement with a smartphone app for PrEP uptake. In these discussions we will assess optimal channels and messaging for app dissemination and components within the app to promote engagement. Project Narrative This study will provide in-depth understanding of how stigma impacts acceptability and uptake of PrEP among men who have sex with men in Guatemala. Findings will inform development of a smartphone app to reduce stigma and increase access to PrEP that will be transferable throughout Central America and globally.",PrEP Up!: Understanding PrEP stigma to improve uptake among men who have sex with men,9914144,R21TW011264,"['21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Awareness ', ' Brazil ', ' Central America ', ' Cities ', ' Client ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Ecuador ', ' Faculty ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Guatemala ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Health Services ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Interview ', ' Latin America ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Peru ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Social Environment ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Logistics ', ' uptake ', ' Knowledge ', ' Viread ', ' Tenofovir ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Applied Science ', ' Applied Research ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', "" beta-L-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine "", ' emtricitabine ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' virtual ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' scale up ', ' cost effective ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' control trial ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' mHealth ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' personalized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' Latin American ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' recruit ', ' smartphone Application ', ' Android App ', ' Android Application ', ' Cell Phone Application ', ' Cell phone App ', ' Cellular Phone App ', ' Cellular Phone Application ', ' Smart Phone App ', ' Smart Phone Application ', ' Smartphone App ', ' iOS app ', ' iOS application ', ' iPhone App ', ' iPhone Application ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' ']",FIC,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2020,169418,0.32656777637807727
"Characterizing the HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis care continuum for African American and Hispanic/Latino men who have sex with men PROJECT SUMMARY  Young African American (AA) and Hispanic/Latino (H/L) MSM bear a disproportionate share of the HIV disease burden in the United States (US). Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective in reducing HIV acquisition risks among MSM, but its ability to reduce HIV acquisition among AA and H/L MSM hinges on optimal implementation and expanded use in “real-world” clinical settings. Preliminary studies demonstrate that AA and H/L initiate PrEP and are retained in PrEP care at lower rates than their White counterparts, but little is known about longer-term adherence and retention in PrEP care among AA and H/L MSM. The manner in which structural, social, and individual level factors impact PrEP outcomes in real-world settings, particularly among young AA and H/L MSM, are not yet well understood. MSM who initiate PrEP may change behaviors (e.g., enter a monogamous relationship with an HIV negative partner) and no longer be indicated for PrEP. Furthermore, it is largely unknown why individuals, especially AA and H/L MSM, are not retained in PrEP care which complicates development of appropriate interventions to enhance retention in PrEP care. This proposed study follows a longitudinal, observational cohort (n=450) of White, AA and H/L MSM in real-world PrEP programs in Mississippi, Missouri, and Rhode Island to both characterize a PrEP care continuum and predict why MSM are sub-optimally adherent or lost to care, with a focus on measuring racial and ethnic disparities (Specific Aim 1). We will conduct individual interviews with MSM who are prescribed PrEP but sub-optimally adherent or drop out of PrEP care (Specific Aim 2) to elucidate reasons for sub-optimal adherence and retention and to identify components of potential interventions to improve adherence and retention in care. Using data from our longitudinal cohort, we will perform microsimulations in the context of an agent-based model to evaluate the impact of sub-optimal PrEP adherence and retention in care on HIV incidence in three diverse US settings. We will then predict the impact of potential interventions on PrEP care continuum outcomes (Specific Aim 3). PROJECT NARRATIVE  Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in preventing HIV transmission among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM). However, preliminary studies show that young African American and Hispanic/Latino MSM are retained in PrEP care at lower rates than their White counterparts. This study will follow a large, real-world cohort of MSM enrolled across three diverse United States settings to characterize rates of adherence and retention in PrEP care for young White, African American and Hispanic/Latino MSM, reasons for suboptimal adherence and retention in care, and the impact of different interventions to enhance adherence and retention in PrEP care outcomes on HIV incidence.",Characterizing the HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis care continuum for African American and Hispanic/Latino men who have sex with men,9978620,R01MH114657,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Geography ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest US ', ' Mississippi ', ' Missouri ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' Seasons ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Gays ', ' uptake ', ' Spottings ', ' programs ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Drops ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' prospective ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' FDA approved ', ' primary outcome ', ' clinical infrastructure ', ' AAMSM ', ' African American MSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' BMSM ', ' black MSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' retention strategy ', ' student retention ', ' retention rate ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' adherence rate ', ' ']",NIMH,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R01,2020,656146,0.2793831013845346
"mHealth Peer Support to Reduce Rates of STIs in Black MSM PrEP Users PROEJECT SUMMARY Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with emtricitibine/tenofovir disoproxyl fumarate (FTC/TDF) has been shown to dramatically reduce transmission of HIV in men who have sex with men (MSM). However, as an antiretroviral medication, it does not protect against other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Currently in the US, STI rates are at an “unprecedented high,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These elevated rates are especially pronounced in MSM prescribed PrEP and represent a crucial public health problem that requires immediate attention. Dr. Clement's K23 proposal will focus on addressing this problem through the use of mobile health (mHealth) technology in a critically important population with profound health disparities, Black MSM in the South. First, to understand predictors of STIs, she will explore the relationship between social factors (e.g. social isolation) and STI incidence; these relationships will inform research efforts to focus on those at highest risk for STIs. Second, she will investigate facilitators and barriers to STI risk reduction practices through in-depth interviews (IDIs) with Black MSM PrEP users. She will specifically inquire about peer support as a facilitator to STI risk reduction practices, and gather initial feedback on the peer support features of the mSMART application (“app”). Data will be used to adapt the app, which will be further assessed in focus groups. These qualitative studies will give valuable insight into factors driving sexual risk taking that the mSMART app will then target. Third, in a pilot investigation of Black MSM PrEP users with predictive STI risk factors, as identified in the first aim, she will conduct a randomized study to determine the feasibility and preliminary impact of the adapted mSMART app in reducing STI incidence. Through this proposal, Dr. Clement will build upon her experience in STIs with continued pursuit of critical public health research, and as a result be prepared to become a national leader in the field of HIV/STI prevention. Didactic coursework will bolster Dr. Clement's quantitative analytic skills and solidify her knowledge base. Additionally, she will gain training and experience in mHealth technology, a growing field with broad applications for health care access and delivery. She will also gain an appreciation for the application of qualitative science that will serve fruitful in future investigations. The mentorship team, led by Dr. Susanna Naggie, an experienced HIV investigator, will include experts in behavioral science related to PrEP (Dr. Amy Corneli), the use of mHealth technology in Black MSM (Dr. Sara LeGrand), and biostatistics (Dr. Cliburn Chan). Also included as collaborators are Dr. Arlene Seña, an expert in STIs who is Medical Director of the Durham County Department of Public Health, Dr. Mehri McKellar, the Medical Director of the Duke PrEP clinic, Dr. John Mitchell, a clinical psychologist who has pioneered the mobile app mSMART in PrEP users, Dr. Lisa Hightow-Weidman, a recognized leader in the field of technology based interventions aimed at HIV/STI prevention in young MSM, and Dr. Kenneth Mayer, a world expert in biomedical HIV prevention and the intersection of STIs and PrEP. The proposed aims and accompanying training plan will allow Dr. Clement to mature into an independent researcher in HIV/STI prevention and provide a basis for an R01 to implement her mobile technology intervention for STI prevention in Black MSM PrEP users. PROJECT NARRATIVE STI incidence continues to climb nationally and Black men who have sex with men (MSM) prescribed pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are particularly at risk. New strategies to reduce STI rates in this group are warranted, with attention to social factors that drive sexual risk taking. Mobile health applications offering peer support are a promising solution to effect behavioral change and reduce STI incidence in Black MSM prescribed PrEP. !",mHealth Peer Support to Reduce Rates of
