"ADOLESCENT DRUG USE IN RURAL AMERICA DESCRIPTION:  (Applicant's Abstract)                                                                                                                              This project will provide detailed data on alcohol and drug use and              associated risk factors among rural youth.  Surveys will be administered to      7th-12th grade students in a national sample of rural schools stratified by      region and rurality (county population and distance from a metropolitan          center) with a comparison sample of non-rural schools.  Schools that are         African-American and Mexican-American will be oversampled.  (Comparable data     on drug use of American Indian youth, the other major rural ethnic minority      group, will be available from another project.) The study will also obtain       data on violence, victimization, high risk drug use behaviors, and               delinquency and their relationship to drug use.  The study will use              structural equation modeling to examine how individual risk factors relate       to drug use and delinquency of rural youth and determine whether there are       differences in those relationships by age, gender, ethnicity, and rurality.      Individual risk factors include socialization characteristics such as family     relationships, parental monitoring, school adjustment and peer influences,       personal characteristics such as excitement/risk seeking, anger, emotional       distress, tolerance of deviance and social alienation, and cultural              identification.  The study will use hierarchical linear modeling to              determine how differences in drug use rates across schools are related to        different levels of personal and social risk factors among students in those     schools and to community and school characteristics including school             structure, school normlessness, poverty, ethnic heterogeneity, ascriptive        inequality, community industrial structure, age structure, population            mobility, and family disorganization, and whether these relationships differ     by rurality.

"Homeless Women--Drugs, Race/Ethicity, And Health Care   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant)                                                 Research has shown that drug use and physical health problems are quite common       among the homeless and that their general health-care needs often go unmet.          However, much of this research is based on samples composed largely of homeless      men. To date, there has been little research on the relationship between drug        use and utilization of general health care among homeless women. Moreover,           possible racial/ethnic differences in this relationship have not been                extensively examined. This study will employ secondary data from two                 complementary funded studies to analyze the association between drug use and         use of general health care (inpatient, ambulatory, and preventive). The first        dataset screened for lifetime drug dependence in a community-based probability       sample of 861 homeless women in Los Angeles County, and the second dataset           assessed current heavy drug use and lifetime injection drug use in a purposive       sample of 1,330 homeless women in Los Angeles. We will test hypotheses               regarding a wide range of predisposing and enabling factors (such as case            management, health insurance, and access to public benefits) potentially             associated with access to general health services by African American, Latina,       and White homeless women with drug problems. The proposed study directly             addresses policy questions prominent in NIDA's strategic plan on reducing            health disparities. By documenting the nature and extent of health problems          affecting drug-using homeless women, their use of general health services, the       extent to which their need for care goes unmet, and possible racial/ethnic           differences in these patterns, this study will inform drug treatment providers       on the value and content of screening/assessment procedures they might employ        and the types of general health services for which more effective linkage is         needed.

"IDU Access to HIV/HCV Prevention   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant)                                                                                      A recent health promotion campaign in Rhode Island (RI) to prevent HIV and           Hepatitis C prompted the deregulation of syringes, allowing their sale in            pharmacies without a prescription. Included in this law is that pharmacies may       sell syringes: if so, pharmacists are required to provide syringe disposal           information and may provide drug treatment referral information. This proposal       is to investigate racial/ethnic and gender disparities in access to                  pharmacy-based prevention services associated with this law change. We propose       to evaluate racial/ethnic and gender disparities by geographic barriers              (Specific Aim 1), barriers related to drug users (the consumer of these              services) (Specific Aim 2), and barriers related to pharmacists (the providers       of these services) (Specific Aim 3). We limit our evaluation to the two largest      non-white groups in RI, African Americans/Blacks, and Latino/ Hispanics in           comparison to whites. Geocoding methods will be used for Specific Aim 1. Census      2000 data will be used to identify racially diverse block groups. Socioeconomic      conditions will be quantified to adjust for class in analyses of race. Both          pharmacy and drug user locations will be overlaid to determine geographic            barriers to access. For drug user studies, qualitative and quantitative methods      will determine both perceived and real barriers to accessing pharmacy                prevention services. The qualitative study will use a targeted street                recruitment of injection drug users, while the quantitative study will include       participants in existing drug user cohorts. For pharmacy-related studies, all        pharmacies in the state will be included. We propose a purchaser experience          trial where non-drug using purchasers of different racial/ethnic groups attempt      to purchase a syringe, as well as a pharmacist telephone survey, evaluating          attitudes regarding the law change, their perception regarding drug users and        racial/ethnic groups in general. Analyses will evaluate access (or barriers to       access) and its relation to race, across and between racially and                    socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods. These analyses will provide important       data regarding the implementation of a policy change and the need for targeted       solutions in response to racial disparities.

"Drug use and health disparities in 2 Indian populations                                     DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant)                                                                                                American Indian (AI) youth consistently report higher use of drugs than other        populations in the United States. Further, AI youth are as likely, if not more       so, to experience serious consequences from drug use. However much remains           unknown: The extant literature is largely restricted to AI youth and,                generally, little attention is paid to cultural differences. A more                  comprehensive description of the negative consequences of drug use is needed.        Finally, incorporation of availability, access, and acceptability of health          services into the understanding of health disparities is warranted. This             proposal responds to RFA DA-01-008 with a plan to make significant progress in       depicting and understanding these disparities. Data from the recently completed      American Indian Service Utilization, Psychiatric Epidemiology, and                   Risk/Protective Factors Project (AI-SUPERPFP) provide an opportunity to better       understand the drug-related health disparities between 2 of the largest tribal       populations. The specific aims are 1) To develop models of the biopsychosocial       factors important to understanding health disparities in drug use and its            adverse consequences. 2) To depict the disparities in the use of drugs               (including tobacco) between 2 AI populations and, further, to investigate the        degree to which ethnic differences in biopsychosocial factors may account for        these disparities. 3) To depict the disparities in the behavioral, social,           medical, and mental health consequences of drug use and to investigate the           degree to which differences in biopsychosocial factors and drug use explain          these disparities. 4) To describe the disparities in utilization of health           services and to investigate the relationships of health services,                    biopsychosocial factors, drug use, and adverse consequences. 5) To place these       findings in a national context with the use of judicious comparisons to the          National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) 14-19 and the National Household Survey of         Drug Abuse (NHSDA).                                                                                                                                                       The proposed analyses of AI-SUPERPFP--the first large-scale, community-based         alcohol, drug and mental health (ADM) epidemiologic study of AIs promises to         provide insights drug-related health disparities in a manner never before            possible: first with a thorough investigation of such disparities across two of      the largest, but culturally distinct, tribal groups; and later with targeted         comparisons of these findings with national data from two comparable efforts         with national samples. Furthermore, the Division of American Indian and Alaska       Native Programs (DAIANP) provides a unique multidisciplinary environment             (including staff from psychology, psychiatry, internal medicine, demography,         anthropology, and public health) in which to conduct this work, thus promising       to inform disparities research more generally.

"Measuring Sexual Minority Status Among Women Drug Users   DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): An estimated 20-30 percent of women          drug users are lesbian, bisexual or other women who have sex with women (WSWs).      Contrary to theories that WSW drug users' same-sex behavior is a function of         sex work or incarceration, recent ethnographic work on WSW injectors suggests        that a majority of WSW drug users can be considered ""sexual minorities,"" which       we define as women for whom same-sex orientation is an important aspect of           their social lives. Sexual minority status appears to affect health,                 health-related behaviors, and the health and drug treatment service experiences      of women drug users in important ways. Additional research is needed to              determine precisely how sexual minority status may complicate the health             consequences of illicit drug use among women, and especially to design and           evaluate interventions to reduce disparities in health between sexual minority       and other drug-using women. Research of this sort, however, will first require       the development of measures of sexual minority status that are valid and             reliable for women drug users. This will be accomplished by: 1) increasing our       understanding of the components of sexual minority status via secondary              analysis of a recently-concluded ethnographic study of women lDUs in New York        and Boston (which collected 260 in-depth interviews with 78 WSW subjects); 2)        using these analyses to develop empirically-grounded measures of sexual              minority status; and 3) preliminary validation of these measures via a pilot         survey of 120 women drug users (including an estimated 24-36 sexual minorities)      in New York City. The proposed study directly addresses recent recommendations       by the Institute of Medicine's Committee on Lesbian Health Research Priorities       that improved, multi-dimensional measures of sexual orientation be developed         and applied to low-income and ethnic minority women, with specific attention to      illicit drug use and its sequelae among lesbians.

"Ethnic Differences in Competence and Adolescent Drug Use   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant)                                                                                              School-based drug abuse prevention programs that combine social and personal         competence enhancement with refusal skills training have been shown to reduce        adolescent substance use. Etiology research is needed to clarify how the             components of effective prevention programs work. Little is known about the          mediating mechanisms and moderating factors that explain how and when                competence skills are protective and whether these mechanisms change over the        course of adolescence. For example, in addition to being better equipped to          resist peer influences, socially competent youth may perceive fewer social           benefits to engaging in drug use compared to youth with poor interpersonal           negotiation skills. Youth with good cognitive and behavioral self-management         strategies (i.e., personal competence) may succeed in developmental tasks and        experience a sense of mastery and psychological well-being that is protective        in terms of drug involvement. Because rates of substance use differ among            ethnic and gender subgroups of youth, it is important to determine if                competence-based etiological models apply to different subgroups of                  adolescents, in particular inner-city minority youth in high-nisk settings. A        primary aim of the proposed research is to develop, test, and refine several         etiologic models that focus on social and personal competence skills and             adolescent substance use over the course of adolescence, and to examine these        models among two distinct samples from 7th grade through the 12th grade: a           predominantly white, suburban sample (N=3,549), and a largely minority,              inner-city sample (N=2,229). This will be accomplished through secondary data        analysis of control group participants from two school-based drug abuse              prevention trials. The proposed research aims to elucidate how competence            skills influence the initiation, escalation, and maintenance of drug use during      adolescence by examining mediational and moderational models and                     cross-validating them across ethnic and gender subgroups. By improving our           understanding of how drug use develops over the course of adolescence among          youth of different racial/ethnic backgrounds, a long-term goal of the proposed       research is to inform the development of effective prevention programs for           ethnically diverse populations, and ultimately, to reduce rates of substance         abuse and addiction that contribute to health disparities among racial/ethnic        populations.

"Club Drugs/Resource Inequity/Health Risk in Urban Youth   DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): This five year study entitled ""Club         Drugs, Resource Inequities and Health Risks among Urban Youth"" will identify         the contextual, socio-cultural and psychological factors that influence urban        youth and young adults to incorporate club drugs into their drug repertoires,        changes in drug use patterns over time, and the psychosocial, economic and           health consequences of club drug use and concurrent polydrug mixing. The study       responds to NIDA's RFA DA-0 1 -0 10 entitled ""Responding to Club Drugs And           Other Emerging And Current Drug Abuse Trends."" Study aims are to: 1) describe        the marketing and diffusion of club and designer drugs into urban youth and          young adult drug markets through clubs, after-hours, and other social                activities, and describe the meaning of these drugs in relation to traditional       street drugs (regular and high THC marijuana, leaves with formaldehyde,              alcohol, dust, cocaine, crack and heroin), 2) conduct a panel study with two         time points eight months apart with 500 youth ages 16 - 30 to deter-mine             changes in patterns of MDMA and other dance and prescription drugs, and              predictors and consequences of use, 3) utilize the information to develop            strategies for dance and prescription drug risk prevention in street and party       settings. Component 1 (Months I - 50) of the study will continue established         patterns of ethnographic research in settings where urban youth and young            adults buy, sell, learn about and experiment with new drugs and drug mixing.         Component 2 (Months 8 - 58) will involve administering an                            epidemiologic/network survey to the study cohort of 500 youth and young adults       between the ages of 16 - 30. In Component 3 (Months 42-60) we will use ongoing       study results in partnership with a team of youth consultants to develop and         pilot test for acceptability a strategy for preventing risks associated with         MDMA and other club drug use and drug mixing to be utilized in drug use sites,       with distributors and in networks of users. Throughout, we will review and           integrate emerging literature linking findings to the primary theoretical            concepts guiding the study. The significance of the study lies in its                description of the ways in which new potentially dangerous drugs are diffused        into a high risk urban environment, its incorporation of the psychosocial,           economic and contextual factors in understanding drug selling, its focus on          understudied polydrug use among urban youth, its examination of neighborhood         factors in drug selection and use, and its partnership with youth and                youth-serving clubs and site gatekeepers to engage in risk reduction. The study      promises to produce new analytic and theoretical insights into the diffusion of      new drugs into already saturated urban youth drug markets and the consequences       of their use.

This is a        geographic area in which the mainstream culture is heavily bicultural, a             pattern which is expected to typify an increasingly large segment of the West        and Southwest regions of the United States during the next decade. Knowledge         gained in this study is expected to benefit service planners who would               anticipate need for current and future service strategies to better respond to       the problems and needs of Hispanic and bicultural populations. Specific aims         are 1) to describe the prevalence of substance use, abuse, and dependence, and       the demographic and social correlates of use among households living on the          border, and to measure the changes in prevalence that have occurred during the       past six years since a similar study was done; 2) to investigate the role of         acculturation in explaining differences in substance use within the Hispanic         border community; and 3) to determine border residents' attitudes and behaviors      related to the utilization of treatment services and the correlates of these         attitudes and behaviors. These questions will be addressed through an in-person      survey of 1200 adults living in households: 400 from the El Paso metropolitan        area, 400 from the Rio Grande Valley metropolitan area, and 400 from colonias        (rural, unincorporated communities often characterized by lack of basic public       services).

"Homeless Women: Drugs, Race/Ethicity, And Health Care   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant)                                                 Research has shown that drug use and physical health problems are quite common       among the homeless and that their general health-care needs often go unmet.          However, much of this research is based on samples composed largely of homeless      men. To date, there has been little research on the relationship between drug        use and utilization of general health care among homeless women. Moreover,           possible racial/ethnic differences in this relationship have not been                extensively examined. This study will employ secondary data from two                 complementary funded studies to analyze the association between drug use and         use of general health care (inpatient, ambulatory, and preventive). The first        dataset screened for lifetime drug dependence in a community-based probability       sample of 861 homeless women in Los Angeles County, and the second dataset           assessed current heavy drug use and lifetime injection drug use in a purposive       sample of 1,330 homeless women in Los Angeles. We will test hypotheses               regarding a wide range of predisposing and enabling factors (such as case            management, health insurance, and access to public benefits) potentially             associated with access to general health services by African American, Latina,       and White homeless women with drug problems. The proposed study directly             addresses policy questions prominent in NIDA's strategic plan on reducing            health disparities. By documenting the nature and extent of health problems          affecting drug-using homeless women, their use of general health services, the       extent to which their need for care goes unmet, and possible racial/ethnic           differences in these patterns, this study will inform drug treatment providers       on the value and content of screening/assessment procedures they might employ        and the types of general health services for which more effective linkage is         needed.

"COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH ON DRUG ABUSE DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) This P01 aims to develop and apply state-of-the-art methods to analyze existing but under-utilized drug abuse databases in collaboration with their owners. We address contemporary, theoretical, and applied issues in drug abuse research to understand intersections between substance abuse and AIDS risk behaviors as well as minority and gender-based health disparities. We work together with dozens of investigators from education, epidemiology, medicine, psychiatry, psychology, public health, social work, and sociology who own exciting substance abuse data to develop models that test current theories, especially on epidemiology, prevention, intervention, and treatment of drug abuse, using modern multivariate psychometric and statistical methods to control for measurement errors, biases, and other confounds. The Models and Methods Project develops analytic techniques (e.g., improved structural equation methods for small samples, missing and nonnormal data, outliers, dependent and hierarchical data, functional imaging) that hold special promise for improving the quality of drug abuse and AIDS research. The At-Risk Project studies substance abuse related data sets on vulnerable populations (substance abusers, homeless people, individuals who are HIV positive or who have AIDS, victims of domestic abuse, runaways, gang members, and others at high risk for AIDS or drug abuse) with methods to control the sampling, measurement, distributional and other biases that may exist. The Community Project studies drug abuse etiology, adult consequences, HIV risk, intergenerational processes, general deviance, and related issues in large community-based samples, and develops and tests explanatory theories using models that permit separation of common from specific effects, control for artifacts, etc. The Latino Project uses datasets from varied Latino groups to study within- and between-Latino population drug abuse etiology, test and extend an ecological theory of Latino drug use, and study HIV risk and acculturative phenomena related to drug use. The Core Project oversees and integrates all components, hosts visiting scholars, provides computer facilities, and sponsors a mentoring program for disadvantaged students.

Included in this law is that pharmacies may       sell syringes: if so, pharmacists are required to provide syringe disposal           information and may provide drug treatment referral information. This proposal       is to investigate racial/ethnic and gender disparities in access to                  pharmacy-based prevention services associated with this law change. We propose       to evaluate racial/ethnic and gender disparities by geographic barriers              (Specific Aim 1), barriers related to drug users (the consumer of these              services) (Specific Aim 2), and barriers related to pharmacists (the providers       of these services) (Specific Aim 3). We limit our evaluation to the two largest      non-white groups in RI, African Americans/Blacks, and Latino/ Hispanics in           comparison to whites. Geocoding methods will be used for Specific Aim 1. Census      2000 data will be used to identify racially diverse block groups. Socioeconomic      conditions will be quantified to adjust for class in analyses of race. Both          pharmacy and drug user locations will be overlaid to determine geographic            barriers to access. For drug user studies, qualitative and quantitative methods      will determine both perceived and real barriers to accessing pharmacy                prevention services. The qualitative study will use a targeted street                recruitment of injection drug users, while the quantitative study will include       participants in existing drug user cohorts. For pharmacy-related studies, all        pharmacies in the state will be included. We propose a purchaser experience          trial where non-drug using purchasers of different racial/ethnic groups attempt      to purchase a syringe, as well as a pharmacist telephone survey, evaluating          attitudes regarding the law change, their perception regarding drug users and        racial/ethnic groups in general. Analyses will evaluate access (or barriers to       access) and its relation to race, across and between racially and                    socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods. These analyses will provide important       data regarding the implementation of a policy change and the need for targeted       solutions in response to racial disparities.

"Drug use and health disparities in 2 Indian populations                                     DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant)                                                                                                American Indian (AI) youth consistently report higher use of drugs than other        populations in the United States. Further, AI youth are as likely, if not more       so, to experience serious consequences from drug use. However much remains           unknown: The extant literature is largely restricted to AI youth and,                generally, little attention is paid to cultural differences. A more                  comprehensive description of the negative consequences of drug use is needed.        Finally, incorporation of availability, access, and acceptability of health          services into the understanding of health disparities is warranted. This             proposal responds to RFA DA-01-008 with a plan to make significant progress in       depicting and understanding these disparities. Data from the recently completed      American Indian Service Utilization, Psychiatric Epidemiology, and                   Risk/Protective Factors Project (AI-SUPERPFP) provide an opportunity to better       understand the drug-related health disparities between 2 of the largest tribal       populations. The specific aims are 1) To develop models of the biopsychosocial       factors important to understanding health disparities in drug use and its            adverse consequences. 2) To depict the disparities in the use of drugs               (including tobacco) between 2 AI populations and, further, to investigate the        degree to which ethnic differences in biopsychosocial factors may account for        these disparities. 3) To depict the disparities in the behavioral, social,           medical, and mental health consequences of drug use and to investigate the           degree to which differences in biopsychosocial factors and drug use explain          these disparities. 4) To describe the disparities in utilization of health           services and to investigate the relationships of health services,                    biopsychosocial factors, drug use, and adverse consequences. 5) To place these       findings in a national context with the use of judicious comparisons to the          National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) 14-19 and the National Household Survey of         Drug Abuse (NHSDA).                                                                                                                                                       The proposed analyses of AI-SUPERPFP--the first large-scale, community-based         alcohol, drug and mental health (ADM) epidemiologic study of AIs promises to         provide insights drug-related health disparities in a manner never before            possible: first with a thorough investigation of such disparities across two of      the largest, but culturally distinct, tribal groups; and later with targeted         comparisons of these findings with national data from two comparable efforts         with national samples. Furthermore, the Division of American Indian and Alaska       Native Programs (DAIANP) provides a unique multidisciplinary environment             (including staff from psychology, psychiatry, internal medicine, demography,         anthropology, and public health) in which to conduct this work, thus promising       to inform disparities research more generally.

This is a        geographic area in which the mainstream culture is heavily bicultural, a             pattern which is expected to typify an increasingly large segment of the West        and Southwest regions of the United States during the next decade. Knowledge         gained in this study is expected to benefit service planners who would               anticipate need for current and future service strategies to better respond to       the problems and needs of Hispanic and bicultural populations. Specific aims         are 1) to describe the prevalence of substance use, abuse, and dependence, and       the demographic and social correlates of use among households living on the          border, and to measure the changes in prevalence that have occurred during the       past six years since a similar study was done; 2) to investigate the role of         acculturation in explaining differences in substance use within the Hispanic         border community; and 3) to determine border residents' attitudes and behaviors      related to the utilization of treatment services and the correlates of these         attitudes and behaviors.

"Measuring Sexual Minority Status Among Women Drug Users   DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): An estimated 20-30 percent of women          drug users are lesbian, bisexual or other women who have sex with women (WSWs).      Contrary to theories that WSW drug users' same-sex behavior is a function of         sex work or incarceration, recent ethnographic work on WSW injectors suggests        that a majority of WSW drug users can be considered ""sexual minorities,"" which       we define as women for whom same-sex orientation is an important aspect of           their social lives. Sexual minority status appears to affect health,                 health-related behaviors, and the health and drug treatment service experiences      of women drug users in important ways. Additional research is needed to              determine precisely how sexual minority status may complicate the health             consequences of illicit drug use among women, and especially to design and           evaluate interventions to reduce disparities in health between sexual minority       and other drug-using women. Research of this sort, however, will first require       the development of measures of sexual minority status that are valid and             reliable for women drug users. This will be accomplished by: 1) increasing our       understanding of the components of sexual minority status via secondary              analysis of a recently-concluded ethnographic study of women lDUs in New York        and Boston (which collected 260 in-depth interviews with 78 WSW subjects); 2)        using these analyses to develop empirically-grounded measures of sexual              minority status; and 3) preliminary validation of these measures via a pilot         survey of 120 women drug users (including an estimated 24-36 sexual minorities)      in New York City. The proposed study directly addresses recent recommendations       by the Institute of Medicine's Committee on Lesbian Health Research Priorities       that improved, multi-dimensional measures of sexual orientation be developed         and applied to low-income and ethnic minority women, with specific attention to      illicit drug use and its sequelae among lesbians. Towards this end, this             proposed R03 study will develop measures of sexual minority status to be used        in future epidemiological and health services research among women drug users.

"COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH ON DRUG ABUSE DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) This P01 aims to develop and apply state-of-the-art methods to analyze existing but under-utilized drug abuse databases in collaboration with their owners. We address contemporary, theoretical, and applied issues in drug abuse research to understand intersections between substance abuse and AIDS risk behaviors as well as minority and gender-based health disparities. We work together with dozens of investigators from education, epidemiology, medicine, psychiatry, psychology, public health, social work, and sociology who own exciting substance abuse data to develop models that test current theories, especially on epidemiology, prevention, intervention, and treatment of drug abuse, using modern multivariate psychometric and statistical methods to control for measurement errors, biases, and other confounds. The Models and Methods Project develops analytic techniques (e.g., improved structural equation methods for small samples, missing and nonnormal data, outliers, dependent and hierarchical data, functional imaging) that hold special promise for improving the quality of drug abuse and AIDS research. The At-Risk Project studies substance abuse related data sets on vulnerable populations (substance abusers, homeless people, individuals who are HIV positive or who have AIDS, victims of domestic abuse, runaways, gang members, and others at high risk for AIDS or drug abuse) with methods to control the sampling, measurement, distributional and other biases that may exist. The Community Project studies drug abuse etiology, adult consequences, HIV risk, intergenerational processes, general deviance, and related issues in large community-based samples, and develops and tests explanatory theories using models that permit separation of common from specific effects, control for artifacts, etc. The Latino Project uses datasets from varied Latino groups to study within- and between-Latino population drug abuse etiology, test and extend an ecological theory of Latino drug use, and study HIV risk and acculturative phenomena related to drug use. The Core Project oversees and integrates all components, hosts visiting scholars, provides computer facilities, and sponsors a mentoring program for disadvantaged students.

"IDU Access to HIV/HCV Prevention   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant)                                                                                      A recent health promotion campaign in Rhode Island (RI) to prevent HIV and           Hepatitis C prompted the deregulation of syringes, allowing their sale in            pharmacies without a prescription. Included in this law is that pharmacies may       sell syringes: if so, pharmacists are required to provide syringe disposal           information and may provide drug treatment referral information. This proposal       is to investigate racial/ethnic and gender disparities in access to                  pharmacy-based prevention services associated with this law change. We propose       to evaluate racial/ethnic and gender disparities by geographic barriers              (Specific Aim 1), barriers related to drug users (the consumer of these              services) (Specific Aim 2), and barriers related to pharmacists (the providers       of these services) (Specific Aim 3). We limit our evaluation to the two largest      non-white groups in RI, African Americans/Blacks, and Latino/ Hispanics in           comparison to whites. Geocoding methods will be used for Specific Aim 1. Census      2000 data will be used to identify racially diverse block groups. Socioeconomic      conditions will be quantified to adjust for class in analyses of race. Both          pharmacy and drug user locations will be overlaid to determine geographic            barriers to access. For drug user studies, qualitative and quantitative methods      will determine both perceived and real barriers to accessing pharmacy                prevention services. The qualitative study will use a targeted street                recruitment of injection drug users, while the quantitative study will include       participants in existing drug user cohorts. For pharmacy-related studies, all        pharmacies in the state will be included. We propose a purchaser experience          trial where non-drug using purchasers of different racial/ethnic groups attempt      to purchase a syringe, as well as a pharmacist telephone survey, evaluating          attitudes regarding the law change, their perception regarding drug users and        racial/ethnic groups in general.

"Homeless Women: Drugs, Race/Ethicity, And Health Care   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant)                                                 Research has shown that drug use and physical health problems are quite common       among the homeless and that their general health-care needs often go unmet.          However, much of this research is based on samples composed largely of homeless      men. To date, there has been little research on the relationship between drug        use and utilization of general health care among homeless women. Moreover,           possible racial/ethnic differences in this relationship have not been                extensively examined. This study will employ secondary data from two                 complementary funded studies to analyze the association between drug use and         use of general health care (inpatient, ambulatory, and preventive). The first        dataset screened for lifetime drug dependence in a community-based probability       sample of 861 homeless women in Los Angeles County, and the second dataset           assessed current heavy drug use and lifetime injection drug use in a purposive       sample of 1,330 homeless women in Los Angeles. We will test hypotheses               regarding a wide range of predisposing and enabling factors (such as case            management, health insurance, and access to public benefits) potentially             associated with access to general health services by African American, Latina,       and White homeless women with drug problems. The proposed study directly             addresses policy questions prominent in NIDA's strategic plan on reducing            health disparities. By documenting the nature and extent of health problems          affecting drug-using homeless women, their use of general health services, the       extent to which their need for care goes unmet, and possible racial/ethnic           differences in these patterns, this study will inform drug treatment providers       on the value and content of screening/assessment procedures they might employ        and the types of general health services for which more effective linkage is         needed.

"Neurocognitive Function in Russian Heroin Addicts DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research on the neurocognitive consequences of chronic heroin use is sparse, despite the global existence of millions of addicts and young initiates. Most U.S. studies include polydrug abusers and are unable to precisely distinguish between neurocognitive consequences of specific drugs. This deficit is particularly true for heroin addiction, which is often also preceded by several years of extensive use of other drugs, confounding the ability to assess single drug effects. Thus, it is important to determine whether there are neurocognitive impairments associated specifically with heroin addiction that may differ from those associated with alcoholism or whether the same deficits are common to multiple drug users. To elucidate differential neurocognitive consequences of heroin use, it is necessary to identify a population with a dependency on only one drug. Most studies of drug effects on brain function also do not measure prefrontally modulated executive cognitive function (ECF) and focus largely on general neuropsychological function. Recent research using state-of-the-art cognitive instruments provides support for a relationship between specific dimensions of ECF and drug abuse propensity and persistence. ECF may predict relapse propensity, and intact function may be a prerequisite for favorable responses to treatment programs that require a certain level of cognitive processing. There is also insufficient research on gender disparities in the cognitive consequences of drug use, despite differences in historical patterns of use, neurologic drug effects, and involvement of contextual factors. ECF assessment of male and female heroin addicts entering treatment is useful for the evaluation of aspects of cognitive functioning that may be relevant for optimal therapeutic management and treatment planning.      To evaluate differential relationships between ECF in heroin addicts versus alcoholics among these groups, the proposed study will focus on single drug users without extensive prior use of other drugs from an inpatient treatment facility in St. Petersburg, Russia. Two control groups will be included: polydrug abusers from the facility and a group of nondrug abusers from the community. Neurocognitive tests will be administered after detoxification. Mediating effects of personality traits on cognitive outcomes will further be assessed. This innovative design and unique sample population will generate findings critical to understanding differences in ECF among heroin addicts, alcoholics, and polydrug abusers, as well as differential gender effects.

"The neighborhood environment and drug use in NYC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a study is to assess the relations between neighborhood characteristics (e.g., neighborhood disadvantage, collective efficacy, residential segregation) and drug use behavior among residents of New York City while controlling for relevant individual-level factors. A secondary purpose of this study is to determine the relation between key neighborhood characteristics and the medical consequences of drug use, particularly fatal drug overdose. Recent work has shown that neighborhood characteristics are associated with the likelihood of drug use, abuse, and dependence and that research focusing exclusively on individual patterns of drug use is insufficient to fully explain inter-individual drug use behavior. Here we propose a systematic collection of data to characterize neighborhoods in a large metropolitan area and to test key hypotheses that may explain inter-individual variability in drug use behavior and its consequences.   Understanding how neighborhood factors affect drug use risk behavior can guide interventions that aim to mitigate drug use and its consequences, to create a social environment that better facilitates users to seek treatment, and to improve overall population health. In order to achieve the aims of this study we will use data from three sources: (i) We will collect data on individual drug use behavior (focusing on cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use) through a random digit-dial phone survey of 5,000 New York City residents, geo-coding and mapping each respondent to their neighborhood of residence; (ii) we will compile a contextual database characterizing New York City neighborhoods using information collected in the survey and using archival data (collected from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Department of City Planning, Police Department, US Census and other sources); and (iii) we will combine this data with data from a NIDA funded study of drug overdose over time (DA 06534; principal investigator: Tardiff, a consultant on this project). We will test key hypotheses about the relations between neighborhood characteristics and drug use, abuse, and dependence using multi-level hierarchical models. We have recently completed several studies of New York City neighborhoods that serve as preliminary exploration of the key hypotheses of this study. This, coupled with our studies involving telephone interviews with 6,000+ New Yorkers is assurance that the aims of this study can be achieved.

"Homeless Women: Drugs, Race/Ethicity, And Health Care   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant)                                                 Research has shown that drug use and physical health problems are quite common       among the homeless and that their general health-care needs often go unmet.          However, much of this research is based on samples composed largely of homeless      men. To date, there has been little research on the relationship between drug        use and utilization of general health care among homeless women. Moreover,           possible racial/ethnic differences in this relationship have not been                extensively examined. This study will employ secondary data from two                 complementary funded studies to analyze the association between drug use and         use of general health care (inpatient, ambulatory, and preventive). The first        dataset screened for lifetime drug dependence in a community-based probability       sample of 861 homeless women in Los Angeles County, and the second dataset           assessed current heavy drug use and lifetime injection drug use in a purposive       sample of 1,330 homeless women in Los Angeles. We will test hypotheses               regarding a wide range of predisposing and enabling factors (such as case            management, health insurance, and access to public benefits) potentially             associated with access to general health services by African American, Latina,       and White homeless women with drug problems. The proposed study directly             addresses policy questions prominent in NIDA's strategic plan on reducing            health disparities. By documenting the nature and extent of health problems          affecting drug-using homeless women, their use of general health services, the       extent to which their need for care goes unmet, and possible racial/ethnic           differences in these patterns, this study will inform drug treatment providers       on the value and content of screening/assessment procedures they might employ        and the types of general health services for which more effective linkage is         needed.

"Drug Attitudes and Behavior on the US/Mexico Border   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant)                                                 The objective of this study is to improve knowledge and understanding of             disparities in drug use and related attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors            concerning drug use and drug treatment utilization among Hispanic and non            Hispanic populations living in proximity to the U.S./Mexico border. This is a        geographic area in which the mainstream culture is heavily bicultural, a             pattern which is expected to typify an increasingly large segment of the West        and Southwest regions of the United States during the next decade. Knowledge         gained in this study is expected to benefit service planners who would               anticipate need for current and future service strategies to better respond to       the problems and needs of Hispanic and bicultural populations. Specific aims         are 1) to describe the prevalence of substance use, abuse, and dependence, and       the demographic and social correlates of use among households living on the          border, and to measure the changes in prevalence that have occurred during the       past six years since a similar study was done; 2) to investigate the role of         acculturation in explaining differences in substance use within the Hispanic         border community; and 3) to determine border residents' attitudes and behaviors      related to the utilization of treatment services and the correlates of these         attitudes and behaviors. These questions will be addressed through an in-person      survey of 1200 adults living in households: 400 from the El Paso metropolitan        area, 400 from the Rio Grande Valley metropolitan area, and 400 from colonias        (rural, unincorporated communities often characterized by lack of basic public       services).

"Neurocognitive Function in Russian Heroin Addicts DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research on the neurocognitive consequences of chronic heroin use is sparse, despite the global existence of millions of addicts and young initiates. Most U.S. studies include polydrug abusers and are unable to precisely distinguish between neurocognitive consequences of specific drugs. This deficit is particularly true for heroin addiction, which is often also preceded by several years of extensive use of other drugs, confounding the ability to assess single drug effects. Thus, it is important to determine whether there are neurocognitive impairments associated specifically with heroin addiction that may differ from those associated with alcoholism or whether the same deficits are common to multiple drug users. To elucidate differential neurocognitive consequences of heroin use, it is necessary to identify a population with a dependency on only one drug. Most studies of drug effects on brain function also do not measure prefrontally modulated executive cognitive function (ECF) and focus largely on general neuropsychological function. Recent research using state-of-the-art cognitive instruments provides support for a relationship between specific dimensions of ECF and drug abuse propensity and persistence. ECF may predict relapse propensity, and intact function may be a prerequisite for favorable responses to treatment programs that require a certain level of cognitive processing. There is also insufficient research on gender disparities in the cognitive consequences of drug use, despite differences in historical patterns of use, neurologic drug effects, and involvement of contextual factors. ECF assessment of male and female heroin addicts entering treatment is useful for the evaluation of aspects of cognitive functioning that may be relevant for optimal therapeutic management and treatment planning.      To evaluate differential relationships between ECF in heroin addicts versus alcoholics among these groups, the proposed study will focus on single drug users without extensive prior use of other drugs from an inpatient treatment facility in St. Petersburg, Russia. Two control groups will be included: polydrug abusers from the facility and a group of nondrug abusers from the community. Neurocognitive tests will be administered after detoxification. Mediating effects of personality traits on cognitive outcomes will further be assessed. This innovative design and unique sample population will generate findings critical to understanding differences in ECF among heroin addicts, alcoholics, and polydrug abusers, as well as differential gender effects. Because the nature and degree of recovery from drug abuse are likely a function of the type or pattern of neurocognitive impairment, differential drug effects must be considered. This study will significantly contribute to NIDA's goal to support international collaborative research to increase understanding of consequences of drug abuse.

"Community Vulnerability and Responses to IDU-Related HIV  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this competing continuation, we will conduct a longitudinal study (1993-2007) of 96 large metropolitan areas to study trends and predictors of changes in the population prevalence of drug injectors, HIV) prevalence among injectors, and related prevention programs. In stage one of this project, we developed ways to estimate the population density of injection drug use and HIV prevalence rates in metropolitan areas. We showed that per capita injection drug use increased during the 1990s in many localities, including Baltimore and Salt Lake City. HIV prevalence rates among drug injectors increased in Baltimore and some other areas. In many metropolitan areas, drug injection and HIV rates among injectors declined. The extent to which local HIV prevention programs reached drug injectors also varied widely: 3 metropolitan areas provided treatment to 20% or more of their injectors, while 13 areas reached less than 5%. HIV counseling and testing rates also varied widely. In cross-sectional analyses, we showed that local government budgetary decisions, social and economic factors, and drug abuse interventions were related to injection drug users per capita, HIV revalence among drug injectors, and the presence and size of various programs to prevent HIV among drug injectors. We will build upon our existing data and construct a database for these 96 metropolitan areas containing annual estimates from 1993 - 2007 of drug injectors per capita; HIV prevalence, incident AIDS cases and AIDS mortality among drug injectors; program availability and size; socioeconomic conditions, and government budgetary allocations. We will (1) describe patterns of change over time in prevention programs and epidemiology. We will use longitudinal analysis methods to study (2) how changing socioeconomic conditions, epidemiologic need, budgetary constraints and choices, and policy choices are related to subsequent HIV prevention programming; and (3) how all these variables are related to later changes in (a) drug injectors per capita, (b) HIV prevalence and AIDS among drug injectors, (c) drug abuse treatment and other programs for drug injectors, and (d) racial/ethnic disparities in appropriate indicators. We will use these analyses to develop a well-theorized scientific understanding of forces that shape metropolitan area HIV/AIDS epidemics, rates of drug injectors per capita, and prevention programs. The resulting scientific knowledge base can help develop programs and policies so as to avoid epidemics and, if needed, control them.

"Club Drugs/Resource Inequity/Health Risk in Urban Youth   DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): This five year study entitled ""Club         Drugs, Resource Inequities and Health Risks among Urban Youth"" will identify         the contextual, socio-cultural and psychological factors that influence urban        youth and young adults to incorporate club drugs into their drug repertoires,        changes in drug use patterns over time, and the psychosocial, economic and           health consequences of club drug use and concurrent polydrug mixing. The study       responds to NIDA's RFA DA-0 1 -0 10 entitled ""Responding to Club Drugs And           Other Emerging And Current Drug Abuse Trends."" Study aims are to: 1) describe        the marketing and diffusion of club and designer drugs into urban youth and          young adult drug markets through clubs, after-hours, and other social                activities, and describe the meaning of these drugs in relation to traditional       street drugs (regular and high THC marijuana, leaves with formaldehyde,              alcohol, dust, cocaine, crack and heroin), 2) conduct a panel study with two         time points eight months apart with 500 youth ages 16 - 30 to deter-mine             changes in patterns of MDMA and other dance and prescription drugs, and              predictors and consequences of use, 3) utilize the information to develop            strategies for dance and prescription drug risk prevention in street and party       settings. Component 1 (Months I - 50) of the study will continue established         patterns of ethnographic research in settings where urban youth and young            adults buy, sell, learn about and experiment with new drugs and drug mixing.         Component 2 (Months 8 - 58) will involve administering an                            epidemiologic/network survey to the study cohort of 500 youth and young adults       between the ages of 16 - 30.

"MINORITY PREDOCTORIAL FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's proposed research is an exploration of the barriers that influence adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) by HIV-positive individuals who use illicit drugs. Twenty years of research suggest that patient characteristics, provider factors, treatment regimen factors, and social/environmental factors play a role in chronic disease treatment compliance. However, few studies have explicitly linked these factors to non-adherence among HIV-positive individuals who use illicit drugs. The proposed study aims to study the impact of these potential barriers through a mixed method design: secondary analysis of the HIV Cost and Services Utilization Study (HCSUS) and content analysis of the Participating and Communicating Together Study (PACT). This information can be used to strengthen medication adherence interventions for HIV positive drug using populations. Moreover, because drug-related HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects African Americans and other communities of color, research that leads to improvements in HIV treatment outcomes for drug-using populations may also help reduce racial/ethnic health disparities.

"COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH ON DRUG ABUSE DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) This P01 aims to develop and apply state-of-the-art methods to analyze existing but under-utilized drug abuse databases in collaboration with their owners. We address contemporary, theoretical, and applied issues in drug abuse research to understand intersections between substance abuse and AIDS risk behaviors as well as minority and gender-based health disparities. We work together with dozens of investigators from education, epidemiology, medicine, psychiatry, psychology, public health, social work, and sociology who own exciting substance abuse data to develop models that test current theories, especially on epidemiology, prevention, intervention, and treatment of drug abuse, using modern multivariate psychometric and statistical methods to control for measurement errors, biases, and other confounds. The Models and Methods Project develops analytic techniques (e.g., improved structural equation methods for small samples, missing and nonnormal data, outliers, dependent and hierarchical data, functional imaging) that hold special promise for improving the quality of drug abuse and AIDS research. The At-Risk Project studies substance abuse related data sets on vulnerable populations (substance abusers, homeless people, individuals who are HIV positive or who have AIDS, victims of domestic abuse, runaways, gang members, and others at high risk for AIDS or drug abuse) with methods to control the sampling, measurement, distributional and other biases that may exist. The Community Project studies drug abuse etiology, adult consequences, HIV risk, intergenerational processes, general deviance, and related issues in large community-based samples, and develops and tests explanatory theories using models that permit separation of common from specific effects, control for artifacts, etc. The Latino Project uses datasets from varied Latino groups to study within- and between-Latino population drug abuse etiology, test and extend an ecological theory of Latino drug use, and study HIV risk and acculturative phenomena related to drug use. The Core Project oversees and integrates all components, hosts visiting scholars, provides computer facilities, and sponsors a mentoring program for disadvantaged students.

"Criminal Justice, Race, and HIV Risk in CT Drug Users DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This exploratory pilot project is being submitted in response to RFA-DA-04-015, ""HIV/AIDS and Other Infections among Drug Users in the Criminal Justice System"" for support under the R21 mechanism. It will examine how involvement in the criminal justice (CJ) system subsequently shapes the HIV related risks and behaviors of individuals with a history of drug use, and how this varies by race and gender. It will focus in particular on understanding how the criminal justice system operates as a structural determinant of both drug- and sexual-related HIV risk in drug users (DUs), and with this understanding, on identifying potential structural interventions-modifications in the CJ system-for promoting HIV prevention among DUs. The project will examine these issues from the perspective of the individual, in order to better understand the HIV prevention needs of DUs involved with the CJ system, and from the perspective of the CJ system, in order to understand where there may be opportunities for reforms or for utilizing CJ personnel to promote HIV prevention (potential structural interventions). With regard to the individual, it will examine three specific mechanisms through which the CJ system is hypothesized to impact on risk among DUs, including, through its effects on: social support networks and family relationships, socio-economic vulnerability, and access to risk reduction programs. With regard to the CJ system, it will focus on the systems of probation and parole (PIP), including laws and regulations relating to P/P, as well as the responsibilities and authority invested in key actors in these systems (e.g. probation and parole officers, attorneys, and judges) and how they exercise this authority.

"IDU Access to HIV/HCV Prevention   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant)                                                                                      A recent health promotion campaign in Rhode Island (RI) to prevent HIV and           Hepatitis C prompted the deregulation of syringes, allowing their sale in            pharmacies without a prescription. Included in this law is that pharmacies may       sell syringes: if so, pharmacists are required to provide syringe disposal           information and may provide drug treatment referral information. This proposal       is to investigate racial/ethnic and gender disparities in access to                  pharmacy-based prevention services associated with this law change. We propose       to evaluate racial/ethnic and gender disparities by geographic barriers              (Specific Aim 1), barriers related to drug users (the consumer of these              services) (Specific Aim 2), and barriers related to pharmacists (the providers       of these services) (Specific Aim 3). We limit our evaluation to the two largest      non-white groups in RI, African Americans/Blacks, and Latino/ Hispanics in           comparison to whites. Geocoding methods will be used for Specific Aim 1. Census      2000 data will be used to identify racially diverse block groups. Socioeconomic      conditions will be quantified to adjust for class in analyses of race. Both          pharmacy and drug user locations will be overlaid to determine geographic            barriers to access. For drug user studies, qualitative and quantitative methods      will determine both perceived and real barriers to accessing pharmacy                prevention services. The qualitative study will use a targeted street                recruitment of injection drug users, while the quantitative study will include       participants in existing drug user cohorts. For pharmacy-related studies, all        pharmacies in the state will be included. We propose a purchaser experience          trial where non-drug using purchasers of different racial/ethnic groups attempt      to purchase a syringe, as well as a pharmacist telephone survey, evaluating          attitudes regarding the law change, their perception regarding drug users and        racial/ethnic groups in general. Analyses will evaluate access (or barriers to       access) and its relation to race, across and between racially and                    socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods.

"Drug Use & Latent Structure of Adolescent Mental Health With cross-classification used to probe for possible male-female and child-adolescent variation, recently published evidence on the mental and behavioral disturbances of young people seems to confirm dimensional models of anxiety and depression (Wadsworth et al., 2001) as well as attention problems (Hudziak et al., 1999). In this new R01 project, the main goal is to investigate youth drug use as it relates to latent structure of mental and behavioral disturbances across age strata in adolescence (12-13,14-15,16-17 years), with due consideration for different drug types (inhalants; club drugs like ecstasy; marijuana; tobacco; alcohol) and levels of drug involvement. Once the underlying latent class structures have been elucidated, and class memberships have been assigned based on the best-supported class structures, the applicant will turn to regression models to probe research questions pertinent to (a) the co-occurrence of adolescent drug involvement and disturbances of the mental life, behavior, and social adaptation, (b) probing for variation in the latent structure across subgroups defined by race-ethnicity to perhaps aid in understanding health disparities that affect minority subgroups, and (c) the clustering of the class members within local areas of residence within the United States, with a specific focus upon analyses that will probe how drug use might sustain delinquent peer groups. The data are from 13,831 youths (age 12-17) recruited after nationally representative sampling for the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) in 1994-1996. For the NHSDA, the youths completed standardized modules on drug involvement, as well as a survey adaptation of Achenbach's Youth Self Report (YSR). The YSR is perhaps, the most. widely used instrument for measuring youth disturbances in the mental life, behavior, and socxal adaptation. In sum, the  plan of research is one that exploits an untapped research opportunity to learn more about adolescent drug taking as it relates to disturbances of the mental life, behavior, and social adaptation. The plan involves the use of two relatively recent biostatistical developments in the form of latent class regression and alternating logistic regression models, which are innovative approaches to the study of research questions that previously have not been asked in large-sample epidemiological studies of national scope.

"Neurocognitive Function in Russian Heroin Addicts DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research on the neurocognitive consequences of chronic heroin use is sparse, despite the global existence of millions of addicts and young initiates. Most U.S. studies include polydrug abusers and are unable to precisely distinguish between neurocognitive consequences of specific drugs. This deficit is particularly true for heroin addiction, which is often also preceded by several years of extensive use of other drugs, confounding the ability to assess single drug effects. Thus, it is important to determine whether there are neurocognitive impairments associated specifically with heroin addiction that may differ from those associated with alcoholism or whether the same deficits are common to multiple drug users. To elucidate differential neurocognitive consequences of heroin use, it is necessary to identify a population with a dependency on only one drug. Most studies of drug effects on brain function also do not measure prefrontally modulated executive cognitive function (ECF) and focus largely on general neuropsychological function. Recent research using state-of-the-art cognitive instruments provides support for a relationship between specific dimensions of ECF and drug abuse propensity and persistence. ECF may predict relapse propensity, and intact function may be a prerequisite for favorable responses to treatment programs that require a certain level of cognitive processing. There is also insufficient research on gender disparities in the cognitive consequences of drug use, despite differences in historical patterns of use, neurologic drug effects, and involvement of contextual factors. ECF assessment of male and female heroin addicts entering treatment is useful for the evaluation of aspects of cognitive functioning that may be relevant for optimal therapeutic management and treatment planning.      To evaluate differential relationships between ECF in heroin addicts versus alcoholics among these groups, the proposed study will focus on single drug users without extensive prior use of other drugs from an inpatient treatment facility in St. Petersburg, Russia. Two control groups will be included: polydrug abusers from the facility and a group of nondrug abusers from the community. Neurocognitive tests will be administered after detoxification. Mediating effects of personality traits on cognitive outcomes will further be assessed. This innovative design and unique sample population will generate findings critical to understanding differences in ECF among heroin addicts, alcoholics, and polydrug abusers, as well as differential gender effects. Because the nature and degree of recovery from drug abuse are likely a function of the type or pattern of neurocognitive impairment, differential drug effects must be considered. This study will significantly contribute to NIDA's goal to support international collaborative research to increase understanding of consequences of drug abuse.

"Criminal Justice, Race, and HIV Risk in CT Drug Users DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This exploratory pilot project is being submitted in response to RFA-DA-04-015, ""HIV/AIDS and Other Infections among Drug Users in the Criminal Justice System"" for support under the R21 mechanism. It will examine how involvement in the criminal justice (CJ) system subsequently shapes the HIV related risks and behaviors of individuals with a history of drug use, and how this varies by race and gender. It will focus in particular on understanding how the criminal justice system operates as a structural determinant of both drug- and sexual-related HIV risk in drug users (DUs), and with this understanding, on identifying potential structural interventions-modifications in the CJ system-for promoting HIV prevention among DUs. The project will examine these issues from the perspective of the individual, in order to better understand the HIV prevention needs of DUs involved with the CJ system, and from the perspective of the CJ system, in order to understand where there may be opportunities for reforms or for utilizing CJ personnel to promote HIV prevention (potential structural interventions). With regard to the individual, it will examine three specific mechanisms through which the CJ system is hypothesized to impact on risk among DUs, including, through its effects on: social support networks and family relationships, socio-economic vulnerability, and access to risk reduction programs. With regard to the CJ system, it will focus on the systems of probation and parole (PIP), including laws and regulations relating to P/P, as well as the responsibilities and authority invested in key actors in these systems (e.g. probation and parole officers, attorneys, and judges) and how they exercise this authority.

"The neighborhood environment and drug use in NYC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a study is to assess the relations between neighborhood characteristics (e.g., neighborhood disadvantage, collective efficacy, residential segregation) and drug use behavior among residents of New York City while controlling for relevant individual-level factors. A secondary purpose of this study is to determine the relation between key neighborhood characteristics and the medical consequences of drug use, particularly fatal drug overdose. Recent work has shown that neighborhood characteristics are associated with the likelihood of drug use, abuse, and dependence and that research focusing exclusively on individual patterns of drug use is insufficient to fully explain inter-individual drug use behavior. Here we propose a systematic collection of data to characterize neighborhoods in a large metropolitan area and to test key hypotheses that may explain inter-individual variability in drug use behavior and its consequences.   Understanding how neighborhood factors affect drug use risk behavior can guide interventions that aim to mitigate drug use and its consequences, to create a social environment that better facilitates users to seek treatment, and to improve overall population health. In order to achieve the aims of this study we will use data from three sources: (i) We will collect data on individual drug use behavior (focusing on cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use) through a random digit-dial phone survey of 5,000 New York City residents, geo-coding and mapping each respondent to their neighborhood of residence; (ii) we will compile a contextual database characterizing New York City neighborhoods using information collected in the survey and using archival data (collected from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Department of City Planning, Police Department, US Census and other sources); and (iii) we will combine this data with data from a NIDA funded study of drug overdose over time (DA 06534; principal investigator: Tardiff, a consultant on this project). We will test key hypotheses about the relations between neighborhood characteristics and drug use, abuse, and dependence using multi-level hierarchical models. We have recently completed several studies of New York City neighborhoods that serve as preliminary exploration of the key hypotheses of this study. This, coupled with our studies involving telephone interviews with 6,000+ New Yorkers is assurance that the aims of this study can be achieved.

"Understanding Self-Reports of Drug Use in Pregnant Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Assessing the accuracy of self-reports (SR) of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use among pregnant and post-partum women is crucial to both their treatment and to the health of their children. The public health and drug treatment policy implications of not obtaining accurate self-reports cannot be overestimated. For example, if African-American women are less likely to report drug use than white women, they are less likely to receive treatment. This is a health care disparity issue. Self-report/other alternate measure (drug tests, for example) agreement rates from pregnant women are highly variable according to ethnicity, drug type, and other factors, and no systematic meta-analytic review has attempted to explain this variability. This project builds upon a previous SBIR which has constructed a meta-analytic database containing 325 studies of self-reports of substance use compared to biological indicators (e.g., urinalysis) or collateral reports (e.g., spousal report), and 2083 individual comparisons. A subset of these studies (98) addressing use among pregnant and/or post-partum women have been acquired and are codable. 54 studies have been coded. The present project will summarize the relationship between SR and alternate measures of substance use among pregnant women, the key goals being to provide average estimates of SR agreement, identify distinct subgroups, and search for moderator variables which might influence the relationship between SR and biological indicators in this unique population. The focus will include careful consideration of factors that might be changed to improve self-report accuracy.         ",Understanding Self-Reports of Drug Use in Pregnant Women,6966777,R21DA017800,"['alcoholism /alcohol abuse ', ' biomarker ', ' drug abuse ', ' tobacco abuse ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' epidemiology ', ' pregnancy ', ' postpartum ', ' female ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' age difference ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' substance abuse related behavior ', ' health disparity ', ' data quality /integrity ', ' ']",NIDA,"NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH INSTITUTES, INC.",R21,2005,216600,0.07307006989190389
"Girls in Drug Abuse Science DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Developing scientists is a priority of the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and this continuation project. The overall aim of this competing continuation application for a Science Education Drug Abuse Partnership Award Project (SEDAPA) is to extend the development and implementation of a curriculum and manual for high school young women to middle school girls in sixth to eighth grade who live in rural Appalachian Kentucky. The specific aims for the project are: (1) To increase the scientific, technological and interpersonal knowledge as well as skills of participating middle-school girls ages 11 to 15 from rural Appalachian Kentucky; (2) To increase the knowledge of parents and middle schoolteachers on gender equity strategies, and teaching techniques to increase the science participation of middle school girls in rural Appalachian Kentucky; (3) To develop and disseminate a model curriculum to enhance science as well as drug abuse research in rural Appalachian Kentucky; and (4) To develop and disseminate a guide for ""Promoting Gender Equity in the Classroom"" to enhance science education in rural and Appalachian areas.

"Community Vulnerability and Responses to IDU-Related HIV  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this competing continuation, we will conduct a longitudinal study (1993-2007) of 96 large metropolitan areas to study trends and predictors of changes in the population prevalence of drug injectors, HIV) prevalence among injectors, and related prevention programs. In stage one of this project, we developed ways to estimate the population density of injection drug use and HIV prevalence rates in metropolitan areas. We showed that per capita injection drug use increased during the 1990s in many localities, including Baltimore and Salt Lake City. HIV prevalence rates among drug injectors increased in Baltimore and some other areas. In many metropolitan areas, drug injection and HIV rates among injectors declined. The extent to which local HIV prevention programs reached drug injectors also varied widely: 3 metropolitan areas provided treatment to 20% or more of their injectors, while 13 areas reached less than 5%. HIV counseling and testing rates also varied widely. In cross-sectional analyses, we showed that local government budgetary decisions, social and economic factors, and drug abuse interventions were related to injection drug users per capita, HIV revalence among drug injectors, and the presence and size of various programs to prevent HIV among drug injectors. We will build upon our existing data and construct a database for these 96 metropolitan areas containing annual estimates from 1993 - 2007 of drug injectors per capita; HIV prevalence, incident AIDS cases and AIDS mortality among drug injectors; program availability and size; socioeconomic conditions, and government budgetary allocations. We will (1) describe patterns of change over time in prevention programs and epidemiology. We will use longitudinal analysis methods to study (2) how changing socioeconomic conditions, epidemiologic need, budgetary constraints and choices, and policy choices are related to subsequent HIV prevention programming; and (3) how all these variables are related to later changes in (a) drug injectors per capita, (b) HIV prevalence and AIDS among drug injectors, (c) drug abuse treatment and other programs for drug injectors, and (d) racial/ethnic disparities in appropriate indicators. We will use these analyses to develop a well-theorized scientific understanding of forces that shape metropolitan area HIV/AIDS epidemics, rates of drug injectors per capita, and prevention programs. The resulting scientific knowledge base can help develop programs and policies so as to avoid epidemics and, if needed, control them.

"Drug Use & Latent Structure of Adolescent Mental Health With cross-classification used to probe for possible male-female and child-adolescent variation, recently published evidence on the mental and behavioral disturbances of young people seems to confirm dimensional models of anxiety and depression (Wadsworth et al., 2001) as well as attention problems (Hudziak et al., 1999). In this new R01 project, the main goal is to investigate youth drug use as it relates to latent structure of mental and behavioral disturbances across age strata in adolescence (12-13,14-15,16-17 years), with due consideration for different drug types (inhalants; club drugs like ecstasy; marijuana; tobacco; alcohol) and levels of drug involvement. Once the underlying latent class structures have been elucidated, and class memberships have been assigned based on the best-supported class structures, the applicant will turn to regression models to probe research questions pertinent to (a) the co-occurrence of adolescent drug involvement and disturbances of the mental life, behavior, and social adaptation, (b) probing for variation in the latent structure across subgroups defined by race-ethnicity to perhaps aid in understanding health disparities that affect minority subgroups, and (c) the clustering of the class members within local areas of residence within the United States, with a specific focus upon analyses that will probe how drug use might sustain delinquent peer groups. The data are from 13,831 youths (age 12-17) recruited after nationally representative sampling for the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) in 1994-1996. For the NHSDA, the youths completed standardized modules on drug involvement, as well as a survey adaptation of Achenbach's Youth Self Report (YSR). The YSR is perhaps, the most. widely used instrument for measuring youth disturbances in the mental life, behavior, and socxal adaptation. In sum, the  plan of research is one that exploits an untapped research opportunity to learn more about adolescent drug taking as it relates to disturbances of the mental life, behavior, and social adaptation. The plan involves the use of two relatively recent biostatistical developments in the form of latent class regression and alternating logistic regression models, which are innovative approaches to the study of research questions that previously have not been asked in large-sample epidemiological studies of national scope.

"Homeless Women: Drugs, Race/Ethicity, And Health Care   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant)                                                 Research has shown that drug use and physical health problems are quite common       among the homeless and that their general health-care needs often go unmet.          However, much of this research is based on samples composed largely of homeless      men. To date, there has been little research on the relationship between drug        use and utilization of general health care among homeless women. Moreover,           possible racial/ethnic differences in this relationship have not been                extensively examined. This study will employ secondary data from two                 complementary funded studies to analyze the association between drug use and         use of general health care (inpatient, ambulatory, and preventive). The first        dataset screened for lifetime drug dependence in a community-based probability       sample of 861 homeless women in Los Angeles County, and the second dataset           assessed current heavy drug use and lifetime injection drug use in a purposive       sample of 1,330 homeless women in Los Angeles. We will test hypotheses               regarding a wide range of predisposing and enabling factors (such as case            management, health insurance, and access to public benefits) potentially             associated with access to general health services by African American, Latina,       and White homeless women with drug problems. The proposed study directly             addresses policy questions prominent in NIDA's strategic plan on reducing            health disparities. By documenting the nature and extent of health problems          affecting drug-using homeless women, their use of general health services, the       extent to which their need for care goes unmet, and possible racial/ethnic           differences in these patterns, this study will inform drug treatment providers       on the value and content of screening/assessment procedures they might employ        and the types of general health services for which more effective linkage is         needed.

"Participant Perspectives on Drug Use/HIV Research Ethics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Investigators studying illicit drug use and related HIV risk face unique ethical challenges. Intoxication, long term drug use, or advanced stages of HIV/AIDS can impair consent capacity. Involvement in criminal activities to purchase drugs and diagnosis of HIV/AIDS make participants especially vulnerable to breaches in confidentiality that may result in criminal prosecution, social stigmatization, or loss of employment. The need for money to purchase drugs or ethnic and economic health disparities may heighten susceptibility to coercion from cash or treatment compensation for research participation. Participants in RCT designs may suffer withdrawal symptoms during detoxification or side effects when experimental treatments interact with street drugs. Dissemination of research results may further stigmatize or sustain societal prejudices against historically oppressed groups. Through focus groups, in-depth interviews, and structured interview surveys, this research aims to explore the hopes, values, and fears that multiply vulnerable illicit drug users bring to research ethics practices. This collaborative project uniting the strengths of the Fordham University Center for Ethics Education and the community based substance abuse and HIV/AIDS experience of the Hispanic Health Council, will examine in both depth and breath the attitudes of street drug users towards research risks and benefits, informed consent, confidentiality, and use of incentives in research on the epidemiology, social correlates, and treatments for drug abuse and HIV related risks. How gender and ethnicity influence these attitudes will also be examined. Long-term goals of this project are to identify ethical concerns among economically disadvantaged, ethnically diverse illicit street drug users that will inform and enhance drug use and HIV risk research in ways that reflect the values and merit the trust of participants.            ",Participant Perspectives on Drug Use/HIV Research Ethics,6892549,R01DA015649,"['communicable disease transmission ', ' ethics ', ' health science research analysis /evaluation ', ' informed consent ', ' human subject ', ' AIDS ', ' HIV infection ', ' interview ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' attitude ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' gender difference ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' substance abuse related disorder ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' substance abuse epidemiology ', ' experimental design ', ' confidentiality ', ' focus group ', ' ']",NIDA,FORDHAM UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,492573,0.20086343638152432
"COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH ON DRUG ABUSE DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) This P01 aims to develop and apply state-of-the-art methods to analyze existing but under-utilized drug abuse databases in collaboration with their owners. We address contemporary, theoretical, and applied issues in drug abuse research to understand intersections between substance abuse and AIDS risk behaviors as well as minority and gender-based health disparities. We work together with dozens of investigators from education, epidemiology, medicine, psychiatry, psychology, public health, social work, and sociology who own exciting substance abuse data to develop models that test current theories, especially on epidemiology, prevention, intervention, and treatment of drug abuse, using modern multivariate psychometric and statistical methods to control for measurement errors, biases, and other confounds. The Models and Methods Project develops analytic techniques (e.g., improved structural equation methods for small samples, missing and nonnormal data, outliers, dependent and hierarchical data, functional imaging) that hold special promise for improving the quality of drug abuse and AIDS research. The At-Risk Project studies substance abuse related data sets on vulnerable populations (substance abusers, homeless people, individuals who are HIV positive or who have AIDS, victims of domestic abuse, runaways, gang members, and others at high risk for AIDS or drug abuse) with methods to control the sampling, measurement, distributional and other biases that may exist. The Community Project studies drug abuse etiology, adult consequences, HIV risk, intergenerational processes, general deviance, and related issues in large community-based samples, and develops and tests explanatory theories using models that permit separation of common from specific effects, control for artifacts, etc. The Latino Project uses datasets from varied Latino groups to study within- and between-Latino population drug abuse etiology, test and extend an ecological theory of Latino drug use, and study HIV risk and acculturative phenomena related to drug use.

The study       responds to NIDA's RFA DA-0 1 -0 10 entitled ""Responding to Club Drugs And           Other Emerging And Current Drug Abuse Trends."" Study aims are to: 1) describe        the marketing and diffusion of club and designer drugs into urban youth and          young adult drug markets through clubs, after-hours, and other social                activities, and describe the meaning of these drugs in relation to traditional       street drugs (regular and high THC marijuana, leaves with formaldehyde,              alcohol, dust, cocaine, crack and heroin), 2) conduct a panel study with two         time points eight months apart with 500 youth ages 16 - 30 to deter-mine             changes in patterns of MDMA and other dance and prescription drugs, and              predictors and consequences of use, 3) utilize the information to develop            strategies for dance and prescription drug risk prevention in street and party       settings. Component 1 (Months I - 50) of the study will continue established         patterns of ethnographic research in settings where urban youth and young            adults buy, sell, learn about and experiment with new drugs and drug mixing.         Component 2 (Months 8 - 58) will involve administering an                            epidemiologic/network survey to the study cohort of 500 youth and young adults       between the ages of 16 - 30. In Component 3 (Months 42-60) we will use ongoing       study results in partnership with a team of youth consultants to develop and         pilot test for acceptability a strategy for preventing risks associated with         MDMA and other club drug use and drug mixing to be utilized in drug use sites,       with distributors and in networks of users. Throughout, we will review and           integrate emerging literature linking findings to the primary theoretical            concepts guiding the study. The significance of the study lies in its                description of the ways in which new potentially dangerous drugs are diffused        into a high risk urban environment, its incorporation of the psychosocial,           economic and contextual factors in understanding drug selling, its focus on          understudied polydrug use among urban youth, its examination of neighborhood         factors in drug selection and use, and its partnership with youth and                youth-serving clubs and site gatekeepers to engage in risk reduction.

The proposed Center will be an inter-institutional collaborative effort involving Morgan State University, a minority institution, and research intensive universities and programmatic initiatives that focus on and specialize in research on drug use and disparities associated with drug use. The Center seeks to build on the collaborative relationships established through the Center to increase the capacity of Morgan State, its faculty and its students to conduct rigorous drug use research with and emphasis on drug use epidemiology, public health, and health disparities related to drug use. In order to actualize the mission of the Center, four components were developed which address the necessary aspects of creating a drug use research center. 1) The Faculty Development Plan, which seeks to advance Morgan faculty by allowing them to engage in off-site collaborative research with individuals specializing in drug research. 2) A second aspect is the Student Development Plan, which seeks to expose, educate and, train minority students in the area of drug use research. 3) The research arm of the project includes a primary and four developmental pilot project, allowing researchers at Morgan to begin using their present expertise and investigating topics in the area of drug use and disparities related to drug use. 4) Overseeing, each of the areas is the proposed plan for the Administrative Units and Center Organization. Through this component collaborative relationships, research projects, and faculty and student development will be monitored and enhanced. As a result of the Center faculty at Morgan State will be further enhanced regarding their ability to conduct rigorous research independently, specifically submitting R01's. Further, Morgan will be sufficiently capable of training students for careers in drug use research by developing a structured program in drug research, and the administrative staff will have the skills necessary to support the research staff in all endeavors related to research projects.

"Understanding Self-Reports of Drug Use in Pregnant Women    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Assessing the accuracy of self-reports (SR) of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use among pregnant and post-partum women is crucial to both their treatment and to the health of their children. The public health and drug treatment policy implications of not obtaining accurate self-reports cannot be overestimated. For example, if African-American women are less likely to report drug use than white women, they are less likely to receive treatment. This is a health care disparity issue. Self-report/other alternate measure (drug tests, for example) agreement rates from pregnant women are highly variable according to ethnicity, drug type, and other factors, and no systematic meta-analytic review has attempted to explain this variability. This project builds upon a previous SBIR which has constructed a meta-analytic database containing 325 studies of self-reports of substance use compared to biological indicators (e.g., urinalysis) or collateral reports (e.g., spousal report), and 2083 individual comparisons. A subset of these studies (98) addressing use among pregnant and/or post-partum women have been acquired and are codable. 54 studies have been coded. The present project will summarize the relationship between SR and alternate measures of substance use among pregnant women, the key goals being to provide average estimates of SR agreement, identify distinct subgroups, and search for moderator variables which might influence the relationship between SR and biological indicators in this unique population. The focus will include careful consideration of factors that might be changed to improve self-report accuracy.         ",Understanding Self-Reports of Drug Use in Pregnant Women,7140430,R21DA017800,"['alcoholism /alcohol abuse ', ' biomarker ', ' drug abuse ', ' tobacco abuse ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' epidemiology ', ' pregnancy ', ' postpartum ', ' female ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' age difference ', ' human data ', ' clinical research ', ' substance abuse related behavior ', ' health disparity ', ' data quality /integrity ', ' ']",NIDA,"NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH INSTITUTES, INC.",R21,2006,176259,0.07307006989190389
"The Center for the Study and Prevention of Drug Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This proposal for the Center for Study and Prevention of Drug Use is submitted by Morgan State University and seeks funding under the PAR-02-016 mechanism in response to the PA entitled ""Minority Institutions' Drug Abuse Research Development Program"" (MIDARP). The proposed Center will be an inter-institutional collaborative effort involving Morgan State University, a minority institution, and research intensive universities and programmatic initiatives that focus on and specialize in research on drug use and disparities associated with drug use. The Center seeks to build on the collaborative relationships established through the Center to increase the capacity of Morgan State, its faculty and its students to conduct rigorous drug use research with and emphasis on drug use epidemiology, public health, and health disparities related to drug use. In order to actualize the mission of the Center, four components were developed which address the necessary aspects of creating a drug use research center. 1) The Faculty Development Plan, which seeks to advance Morgan faculty by allowing them to engage in off-site collaborative research with individuals specializing in drug research. 2) A second aspect is the Student Development Plan, which seeks to expose, educate and, train minority students in the area of drug use research. 3) The research arm of the project includes a primary and four developmental pilot project, allowing researchers at Morgan to begin using their present expertise and investigating topics in the area of drug use and disparities related to drug use. 4) Overseeing, each of the areas is the proposed plan for the Administrative Units and Center Organization. Through this component collaborative relationships, research projects, and faculty and student development will be monitored and enhanced. As a result of the Center faculty at Morgan State will be further enhanced regarding their ability to conduct rigorous research independently, specifically submitting R01's. Further, Morgan will be sufficiently capable of training students for careers in drug use research by developing a structured program in drug research, and the administrative staff will have the skills necessary to support the research staff in all endeavors related to research projects. In sum, the Center will be; self-sustaining and capable of producing future research focused on drug use research.               ",The Center for the Study and Prevention of Drug Use,7285542,R24DA019805,"['biomedical facility ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' training ', ' university ', ' public health ', ' minority institution research support ', ' health science research potential ', ' human subject ', ' clinical research ', ' substance abuse epidemiology ', ' substance abuse related behavior ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDA,MORGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2006,34299,0.2289119318721305
"Drug Use, Disorder & HIV/AIDS Risk in Juvenile Justice Youth:A Longitudinal Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the Northwestern Juvenile Project to examine the developmental patterns of drug use and disorder and risk for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as juvenile justice youth age from adolescence to emerging adulthood and young adulthood. This study responds to NIDA's new initiatives in health disparities in HIV/AIDS in minority populations, specifically the nexus of drug abuse, criminal justice involvement, and HIV/AIDS among African Americans.  African Americans comprise 12% of the US population but 40% of incarcerated populations and 50% of new cases of HIV/AIDS. At year-end 2004, nearly 100,000 juveniles and nearly 2.1 million adults were incarcerated. We will continue to study a racially/ethnically diverse sample (n=758; 330 females, 428 males; 412 African Americans, 137 non-Hispanic whites, 207 Hispanics, 2 other race/ethnicity) of persons who were arrested and detained in Cook County (Chicago) Illinois, aged 10-18 years at recruitment (1997-1998). Since recruitment, data have been collected on the development of substance use and disorders, risk and protective factors, and HIV/AIDS risk behaviors. Participants are re-interviewed whether they are (re)incarcerated or back in the community. We propose to conduct annual interviews 10, 11, 12, and 13 years post-baseline, collect records, and test for HIV infection and selected STIs. Focusing on racial/ethnic disparities, gender and age differences, and effects of incarceration, we will: (1) describe patterns of drug use and disorder - onset, persistence, desistence, and recurrence -- as juvenile justice youth age from adolescence to emerging adulthood and young adulthood; (2) describe patterns of HIV/AIDS risk behaviors during this same period; (3) describe the prevalence and incidence of HIV infection and other STIs; and (4) examine the relationship between drug use and disorder and HIV/AIDS risk behaviors. Extending the Northwestern Juvenile Project allows us to leverage the data already collected to examine health disparities and the role of disproportionate minority confinement in the development of drug use and disorder and HIV/AIDS risk; to identify risk and protective factors that are potentially malleable; to identify points of intervention at key developmental periods; and to extend theoretical models - developed in general population adolescents - to correctional populations.           ","Drug Use, Disorder & HIV/AIDS Risk in Juvenile Justice Youth:A Longitudinal Study",7230882,R01DA022953,"['aging ', ' drug abuse ', ' AIDS ', ' HIV infection ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' sex ', ' correctional institution ', ' clinical research ', ' ']",NIDA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2006,1061942,0.10348631909936978
"Community Vulnerability and Responses to IDU-Related HIV  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this competing continuation, we will conduct a longitudinal study (1993-2007) of 96 large metropolitan areas to study trends and predictors of changes in the population prevalence of drug injectors, HIV) prevalence among injectors, and related prevention programs. In stage one of this project, we developed ways to estimate the population density of injection drug use and HIV prevalence rates in metropolitan areas. We showed that per capita injection drug use increased during the 1990s in many localities, including Baltimore and Salt Lake City. HIV prevalence rates among drug injectors increased in Baltimore and some other areas. In many metropolitan areas, drug injection and HIV rates among injectors declined. The extent to which local HIV prevention programs reached drug injectors also varied widely: 3 metropolitan areas provided treatment to 20% or more of their injectors, while 13 areas reached less than 5%. HIV counseling and testing rates also varied widely. In cross-sectional analyses, we showed that local government budgetary decisions, social and economic factors, and drug abuse interventions were related to injection drug users per capita, HIV revalence among drug injectors, and the presence and size of various programs to prevent HIV among drug injectors. We will build upon our existing data and construct a database for these 96 metropolitan areas containing annual estimates from 1993 - 2007 of drug injectors per capita; HIV prevalence, incident AIDS cases and AIDS mortality among drug injectors; program availability and size; socioeconomic conditions, and government budgetary allocations. We will (1) describe patterns of change over time in prevention programs and epidemiology. We will use longitudinal analysis methods to study (2) how changing socioeconomic conditions, epidemiologic need, budgetary constraints and choices, and policy choices are related to subsequent HIV prevention programming; and (3) how all these variables are related to later changes in (a) drug injectors per capita, (b) HIV prevalence and AIDS among drug injectors, (c) drug abuse treatment and other programs for drug injectors, and (d) racial/ethnic disparities in appropriate indicators. We will use these analyses to develop a well-theorized scientific understanding of forces that shape metropolitan area HIV/AIDS epidemics, rates of drug injectors per capita, and prevention programs. The resulting scientific knowledge base can help develop programs and policies so as to avoid epidemics and, if needed, control them.

"Drug Use & Latent Structure of Adolescent Mental Health With cross-classification used to probe for possible male-female and child-adolescent variation, recently published evidence on the mental and behavioral disturbances of young people seems to confirm dimensional models of anxiety and depression (Wadsworth et al., 2001) as well as attention problems (Hudziak et al., 1999). In this new R01 project, the main goal is to investigate youth drug use as it relates to latent structure of mental and behavioral disturbances across age strata in adolescence (12-13,14-15,16-17 years), with due consideration for different drug types (inhalants; club drugs like ecstasy; marijuana; tobacco; alcohol) and levels of drug involvement. Once the underlying latent class structures have been elucidated, and class memberships have been assigned based on the best-supported class structures, the applicant will turn to regression models to probe research questions pertinent to (a) the co-occurrence of adolescent drug involvement and disturbances of the mental life, behavior, and social adaptation, (b) probing for variation in the latent structure across subgroups defined by race-ethnicity to perhaps aid in understanding health disparities that affect minority subgroups, and (c) the clustering of the class members within local areas of residence within the United States, with a specific focus upon analyses that will probe how drug use might sustain delinquent peer groups. The data are from 13,831 youths (age 12-17) recruited after nationally representative sampling for the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) in 1994-1996. For the NHSDA, the youths completed standardized modules on drug involvement, as well as a survey adaptation of Achenbach's Youth Self Report (YSR). The YSR is perhaps, the most. widely used instrument for measuring youth disturbances in the mental life, behavior, and socxal adaptation. In sum, the  plan of research is one that exploits an untapped research opportunity to learn more about adolescent drug taking as it relates to disturbances of the mental life, behavior, and social adaptation. The plan involves the use of two relatively recent biostatistical developments in the form of latent class regression and alternating logistic regression models, which are innovative approaches to the study of research questions that previously have not been asked in large-sample epidemiological studies of national scope.

"HIV/AIDS & Womens of Color: Roles of Drug Use, Violence & Insurance in HAART Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV/AIDS among women is an epidemic that disproportionately affects women of color. It reflects a convergence of politically sensitive issues (i.e., race, drug use, and sexual behavior) that are difficult to disentangle and address. Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care in 1996, mortality rates from AIDS and its complications have declined, but at a much slower rate among women than men. Previous research indicates that HIV positive African American women are less likely than white women to receive HAART. Several national studies indicate that African American women fare worse than white men on a number of standards of HIV care. The proposed study uses data from the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) confidential data set to 1) assess whether the roles of race and drug use on HAART are moderated by the effects of health insurance coverage and 2) examine longitudinal differences in HAART use among HIV positive female drug users and investigate the extent to which individual latent states (as defined by clusters of psycho-social or behavioral risk factors such as an individual's drug use, drug using partners, depression, and physical or sexual abuse) influence racial/ethnic disparities after controlling for other confounders. Many studies have assessed the independent effects of race, gender, drug use, insurance coverage, and physical or sexual abuse on use of medical care by people with HIV, but little is known about how these risk factors operate in combination or clusters. Several methodological refinements are employed, including use of analytic methods appropriate for longitudinal data and Hidden Markov Models to examine behavioral risk clusters. Study results will improve understanding of the roles of drug use, physical or sexual abuse, and insurance coverage in observed racial disparities of HAART use among HIV positive women and ultimately, improve interventions aimed at reducing racial and other disparities in HIV/AIDS medical care among women. Findings will also inform development of systems for monitoring quality of care among HIV positive women.              ","HIV/AIDS & Womens of Color: Roles of Drug Use, Violence & Insurance in HAART Use",7231107,R21DA022971,"['disease outbreak ', ' health insurance ', ' AIDS ', ' emotion ', ' role ', ' female ', ' violence ', ' sex abuse ', ' ']",NIDA,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2006,263646,0.14345262070792456
"The neighborhood environment and drug use in NYC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a study is to assess the relations between neighborhood characteristics (e.g., neighborhood disadvantage, collective efficacy, residential segregation) and drug use behavior among residents of New York City while controlling for relevant individual-level factors. A secondary purpose of this study is to determine the relation between key neighborhood characteristics and the medical consequences of drug use, particularly fatal drug overdose. Recent work has shown that neighborhood characteristics are associated with the likelihood of drug use, abuse, and dependence and that research focusing exclusively on individual patterns of drug use is insufficient to fully explain inter-individual drug use behavior. Here we propose a systematic collection of data to characterize neighborhoods in a large metropolitan area and to test key hypotheses that may explain inter-individual variability in drug use behavior and its consequences.   Understanding how neighborhood factors affect drug use risk behavior can guide interventions that aim to mitigate drug use and its consequences, to create a social environment that better facilitates users to seek treatment, and to improve overall population health. In order to achieve the aims of this study we will use data from three sources: (i) We will collect data on individual drug use behavior (focusing on cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use) through a random digit-dial phone survey of 5,000 New York City residents, geo-coding and mapping each respondent to their neighborhood of residence; (ii) we will compile a contextual database characterizing New York City neighborhoods using information collected in the survey and using archival data (collected from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Department of City Planning, Police Department, US Census and other sources); and (iii) we will combine this data with data from a NIDA funded study of drug overdose over time (DA 06534; principal investigator: Tardiff, a consultant on this project). We will test key hypotheses about the relations between neighborhood characteristics and drug use, abuse, and dependence using multi-level hierarchical models. We have recently completed several studies of New York City neighborhoods that serve as preliminary exploration of the key hypotheses of this study. This, coupled with our studies involving telephone interviews with 6,000+ New Yorkers is assurance that the aims of this study can be achieved.

"Participant Perspectives on Drug Use/HIV Research Ethics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Investigators studying illicit drug use and related HIV risk face unique ethical challenges. Intoxication, long term drug use, or advanced stages of HIV/AIDS can impair consent capacity. Involvement in criminal activities to purchase drugs and diagnosis of HIV/AIDS make participants especially vulnerable to breaches in confidentiality that may result in criminal prosecution, social stigmatization, or loss of employment. The need for money to purchase drugs or ethnic and economic health disparities may heighten susceptibility to coercion from cash or treatment compensation for research participation. Participants in RCT designs may suffer withdrawal symptoms during detoxification or side effects when experimental treatments interact with street drugs. Dissemination of research results may further stigmatize or sustain societal prejudices against historically oppressed groups. Through focus groups, in-depth interviews, and structured interview surveys, this research aims to explore the hopes, values, and fears that multiply vulnerable illicit drug users bring to research ethics practices. This collaborative project uniting the strengths of the Fordham University Center for Ethics Education and the community based substance abuse and HIV/AIDS experience of the Hispanic Health Council, will examine in both depth and breath the attitudes of street drug users towards research risks and benefits, informed consent, confidentiality, and use of incentives in research on the epidemiology, social correlates, and treatments for drug abuse and HIV related risks. How gender and ethnicity influence these attitudes will also be examined. Long-term goals of this project are to identify ethical concerns among economically disadvantaged, ethnically diverse illicit street drug users that will inform and enhance drug use and HIV risk research in ways that reflect the values and merit the trust of participants.            ",Participant Perspectives on Drug Use/HIV Research Ethics,7123954,R01DA015649,"['communicable disease transmission ', ' ethics ', ' health science research analysis /evaluation ', ' informed consent ', ' human subject ', ' AIDS ', ' HIV infection ', ' interview ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' attitude ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' gender difference ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' substance abuse related disorder ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' substance abuse epidemiology ', ' experimental design ', ' confidentiality ', ' focus group ', ' ']",NIDA,FORDHAM UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,490431,0.20086343638152432

"Drew MIDARP (Infrastructure in Drug Abuse Research) Drug addiction is now viewed as a brain disease. Understanding the biological basis of substance is needed to develop specific treatment paradigms. The consequences of drug addiction are especially noted in inner city neighborhoods, like the Watts/Willowbrook section of Los Angeles -the catchment area for King/Drew Medical Center. Since addiction is such a complex and devastating illness, a committed public health approach, including education, prevention, treatment and research is needed. Drew University is committed to improvement of the infrastructure needed for substance abuse research, education and treatment. Drew University is well funded for non-substance abuse research and there is a high investigator interest in substance abuse research, yet NIH applications related to drug abuse are deficient. Similar, education on the importance of substance abuse and substance abuse research is lacking on campus. The MIDARP program will provide support to develop the infrastructure needed for substance abuse research at Drew. Thus, the goals of this MIDARP application are to: (1) develop the drug abuse research at Drew; (2) provide research development support and experiences to faculty and staff to facilitate independent drug abuse research  careers, (3) foster interest in drug abuse research for students and residents and provide them research  experiences, and 4) provide for continued drug abuse research funded by NIDA or other agencies. We will  specifically encourage the development of minority faculty and students.

"Collaborative Research on Drug Abuse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This P01 develops and applies state-of-the-art methods to analyze existing but under-utilized drug abuse databases in collaboration with their owners. We address contemporary, theoretical, and applied issues in drug abuse research to understand intersections between substance abuse and AIDS risk behaviors as well as minority and gender-based health disparities. We work with dozens of investigators from drug & social policy, epidemiology, health sciences, medicine, nursing, psychiatry, psychology, public health, and social work who own exciting substance abuse data to develop models that test current theories, especially on epidemiology, prevention, intervention, and treatment of drug abuse, using modern multivariate methods to control for measurement errors, biases, and other confounds. The Models and Methods Project develops psychometric and statistical analytic techniques that hold special promise for improving the quality of drug abuse and AIDS research. The At-Risk Project studies substance abuse related data sets on vulnerable populations (substance abusers, homeless people, individuals who are HIV positive or who have AIDS, victims of domestic abuse, runaways, gang members, and others at high risk for AIDS or drug abuse) with methods to control sampling, measurement, distributional and other biases. The Community Project studies drug abuse etiology, adult consequences, HIV risk, intergenerational processes, general deviance, and related issues in large community-based samples, and develops and tests explanatory theories using models that permit separation of common from specific effects, control for artifacts, etc. The Core Project oversees and integrates all components, hosts visiting scholars, provides computer facilities, and sponsors a mentoring program for disadvantaged students. The substantive part of the Models Project and the At-Risk and Community Projects will be developing and testing integrative theories that can be applied across different populations. The findings from their studies will lead to greater understanding of precursors and concomitants of substance abuse and HIV/AIDS risk and transmission. In turn, these findings will guide development of effective interventions to reduce negative health outcomes and treatment disparities in community, ethnic, and vulnerable populations, and provide guidance on how these may be alleviated.      PROGRAM CHARACTERISTICS          ",Collaborative Research on Drug Abuse,7298116,P01DA001070,[''],NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P01,2007,954356,0.06373110537308126
"The Growing Disparity in Illegal Drug Use Across Socioeconomic Strata    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A disparity in illegal drug use that disadvantages individuals in the lower socioeconomic strata has significantly increased in the last two decades. New evidence indicates that this increase results in large part from a changing influence of socioeconomic status (SES) on drug use, and not from a negative influence of drug use on SES that has accumulated over time. However, the SES-related influences responsible for this growing disparity remain largely unknown. . The aims of this study are threefold. First, it will address limitations in current evidence on the growing disparity of illegal drug use across socioeconomic strata. Using the most current, available data the project will (a) update analyses of socioeconomic trends in cocaine past 1998 (b) examine socioeconomic trends up to the present in illegal drugs that have not yet been examined, such as marijuana, methamphetamine, ecstasy, and 'blunts,1 (c) examine whether the growing disparity sterns from differential incidence and/or differential duration of drug use across socioeconomic strata, and (d) examine SES indicators other than education. These analyses will use the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, a nationally- representative, cross-sectional survey of drug use administered yearly, although between 1979 and 1988 it was administered only every third year. Second, the study will predict both changes in the prevalence of illegal drugs over time and also changes in the characteristics of illegal drug users over time. We use a ""Diffusion of Innovation"" framework, which predicts that users of an innovation such as illegal drugs fall into distinct categories such as ""innovators,"" ""early adopters,"" and ""late adopters."" People in each of these categories are theorized to differ from each other in terms of sociodemographic, psychological, and environmental characteristics. Furthermore, the profiles of drug users at one point in time are expected to predict the prevalence of drug use in the future. The third aim of the project is to trace the extent to which the key predictors of illegal drug use, as highlighted by the Diffusion framework, have their roots in the early life course. Using a longitudinal survey that has followed 838 children from 1st grade to age 30, the analysis will examine how far back in the life course current predictors of illegal drug use extend. We expect that many early predictors have not yet been linked to later drug use because the current profile of illegal drug users, which includes factors such as low socioeconomic status, did not emerge until recently. Results from this project will inform policy and intervention programs aimed at reducing the prevalence of illegal drug use across all socioeconomic strata.              ",The Growing Disparity in Illegal Drug Use Across Socioeconomic Strata,7262683,R01DA020575,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' ecstasy ', ' N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine ', ' N,alpha-dimethyl-1,3-benzodioxole-5-ethanamine ', ' Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ', ' MDMA ', ' 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine ', ' Diffusion ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Policy Research ', ' Update ', ' trend ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Funding ', ' Marihuana ', ' marijuana ', ' Methamphetamine ', ' N-Methylamphetamine ', ' Methylamphetamine ', ' Desoxyephedrine ', ' Deoxyephedrine ', ' Crystal Meth ', ' Benzeneethanamine, N,alpha-dimethyl-, (S)- ', ' Drug user ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Social Mobility ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Adopted ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' directed attention ', ' directs attention ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' intervention program ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' falls ', ' Causations ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cocaine ', ' 8-Azabicyclo(3.2.1)octane-2-carboxylic acid, 3-(benzoyloxy)-8-methyl-, methyl ester, (1R-(exo,exo))- ', ' Accounting ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' stem ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER/HSC DENVER,R01,2007,249364,0.22637589368278796
"Participant Perspectives on Drug Use/HIV Research Ethics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Investigators studying illicit drug use and related HIV risk face unique ethical challenges. Intoxication, long term drug use, or advanced stages of HIV/AIDS can impair consent capacity. Involvement in criminal activities to purchase drugs and diagnosis of HIV/AIDS make participants especially vulnerable to breaches in confidentiality that may result in criminal prosecution, social stigmatization, or loss of employment. The need for money to purchase drugs or ethnic and economic health disparities may heighten susceptibility to coercion from cash or treatment compensation for research participation. Participants in RCT designs may suffer withdrawal symptoms during detoxification or side effects when experimental treatments interact with street drugs. Dissemination of research results may further stigmatize or sustain societal prejudices against historically oppressed groups. Through focus groups, in-depth interviews, and structured interview surveys, this research aims to explore the hopes, values, and fears that multiply vulnerable illicit drug users bring to research ethics practices. This collaborative project uniting the strengths of the Fordham University Center for Ethics Education and the community based substance abuse and HIV/AIDS experience of the Hispanic Health Council, will examine in both depth and breath the attitudes of street drug users towards research risks and benefits, informed consent, confidentiality, and use of incentives in research on the epidemiology, social correlates, and treatments for drug abuse and HIV related risks. How gender and ethnicity influence these attitudes will also be examined. Long-term goals of this project are to identify ethical concerns among economically disadvantaged, ethnically diverse illicit street drug users that will inform and enhance drug use and HIV risk research in ways that reflect the values and merit the trust of participants.            ",Participant Perspectives on Drug Use/HIV Research Ethics,7254760,R01DA015649,"['Benefits and Risks ', ' social ', ' Intoxication ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Gender ', ' Legal Liability ', ' Organizational Policy ', ' Research Ethics ', ' Regulation ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Research Ethics Committees ', ' Withdrawal Symptom ', ' theories ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Coercion ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Education ', ' Community HealthTutoring ', ' Community Health Taining ', ' Community Education ', ' dissemination research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' Confidentiality ', ' information privacy ', ' Decision Making ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Population Research ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Guidelines ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Depth ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Incentives ', ' inducement ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Ensure ', ' Interview ', ' Financial compensation ', ' Compensation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxication ', ' detoxification ', ' Metabolism of Toxic Agents ', ' Metabolic Drug Detoxications ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxification ', ' Methods ', ' Morals ', ' Therapeutic Human Experimentation ', ' Therapeutic Research ', ' Prejudice ', ' Staging ', ' Drug user ', ' Public Opinion ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rights ', ' Risk ', ' Social Welfare ', ' welfare ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Street Drugs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Syringes ', ' Universities ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Voice ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Marshal ', ' psychosocial ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Services ', ' AIDS/HIV diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' resource guides ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ']",NIDA,FORDHAM UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,490744,0.20086343638152432
"Homeless Women: Drugs, Race/Ethicity, And Health Care Research has shown that drug use and physical health problems are quite common among the homeless and that their general health-care needs often go unmet. However, much of this research is based on samples composed largely of homeless men. To date, there has been little research on the relationship between drug use and utilization of general health care among homeless women. Moreover, possible racial/ethnic differences in this relationship have not been extensively examined. This study will employ secondary data from two complementary funded studies to analyze the association between drug use and use of general health care (inpatient, ambulatory, and preventive). The first dataset screened for lifetime drug dependence in a community-based probability sample of 861 homeless women in Los Angeles County, and the second dataset assessed current heavy drug use and lifetime injection drug use in a purposive sample of 1,330 homeless women in Los Angeles. We will test hypotheses regarding a wide range of predisposing and enabling factors (such as case management, health insurance, and access to public benefits) potentially associated with access to general health services by African American, Latina, and White homeless women with drug problems. The proposed study directly addresses policy questions prominent in NIDA's strategic plan on reducing health disparities. By documenting the nature and extent of health problems affecting drug-using homeless women, their use of general health services, the extent to which their need for care goes unmet, and possible racial/ethnic differences in these patterns, this study will inform drug treatment providers on the value and content of screening/assessment procedures they might employ and the types of general health services for which more effective linkage is needed.

"Club Drugs, Dance Events, and Asian-American Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this proposed 48 months qualitative continuation project is to expand our existing and on-going research on the overall culture of club drugs use in the San Francisco Bay Area. The prominence of Asian Americans and their drug using practices leads us to propose a change in focus from the scene in its entirety to a detailed examination of the involvement of Asian Americans within the techno dance scene. We will focus on the following four research issues: 1) What are the social, gender and ethnic characteristics of Asian American users of club drugs? 2) What are the patterns, variations and combinations of club drugs used by different Asian ethnic youth subgroups and how do they compare with the larger sample in the parent project? 3) What are the various social settings in which Asian American youth and young adults use club drugs? 4) What are the social processes of club drug use among different Asian ethnic youth? Using primarily qualitative and ethnographic research methods, we will locate and interview 360 young Asian American youth and young adults, between the ages of 16-25, who have used one or more club drugs three or more times in the previous six months. The sample will be sub-divided into equal numbers of male and female and proportionate numbers of immigrants and U.S. born youth. After an initial mapping of Asian participation in the scene, the sampling frame will be expanded to accommodate representative numbers of different Asian ethnic groups.  This project is important for two reasons. First, it will provide much needed empirical data on a growing but understudied population, and possible intra-ethnic variations. While our on-going research seeks to understand the overall social context of club drug use, the proposed research seeks not only to document the extent to which club drugs are used by Asian American youth but to uncover the connections between drug use, involvement in the dance scene and ethnic identity. Second, given the reported increase in problems of club drug use among Asian American youth, data from this project will provide important information on their use of club drugs, their patterns of use and the health and social consequences of their use. This information will assist in designing more effective and culturally appropriate public health initiatives and prevention messages to alert young Asian American adults about the dangers of these drugs.

"HIV/AIDS & Womens of Color: Roles of Drug Use, Violence & Insurance in HAART Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV/AIDS among women is an epidemic that disproportionately affects women of color. It reflects a convergence of politically sensitive issues (i.e., race, drug use, and sexual behavior) that are difficult to disentangle and address. Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care in 1996, mortality rates from AIDS and its complications have declined, but at a much slower rate among women than men. Previous research indicates that HIV positive African American women are less likely than white women to receive HAART. Several national studies indicate that African American women fare worse than white men on a number of standards of HIV care. The proposed study uses data from the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) confidential data set to 1) assess whether the roles of race and drug use on HAART are moderated by the effects of health insurance coverage and 2) examine longitudinal differences in HAART use among HIV positive female drug users and investigate the extent to which individual latent states (as defined by clusters of psycho-social or behavioral risk factors such as an individual's drug use, drug using partners, depression, and physical or sexual abuse) influence racial/ethnic disparities after controlling for other confounders. Many studies have assessed the independent effects of race, gender, drug use, insurance coverage, and physical or sexual abuse on use of medical care by people with HIV, but little is known about how these risk factors operate in combination or clusters. Several methodological refinements are employed, including use of analytic methods appropriate for longitudinal data and Hidden Markov Models to examine behavioral risk clusters. Study results will improve understanding of the roles of drug use, physical or sexual abuse, and insurance coverage in observed racial disparities of HAART use among HIV positive women and ultimately, improve interventions aimed at reducing racial and other disparities in HIV/AIDS medical care among women. Findings will also inform development of systems for monitoring quality of care among HIV positive women.              ","HIV/AIDS & Womens of Color: Roles of Drug Use, Violence & Insurance in HAART Use",7295814,R21DA022971,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Monitor ', ' Rate ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Site ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Medical ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Names ', ' Sexual abuse ', ' sex abuse ', ' Tigers ', ' Panthera tigris ', ' cooking ', ' Drug user ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Social Policies ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Services ', ' AIDS/HIV diagnosis ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Gender ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Drug Insurance ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' HAART ', ' Accounting ', ' Color ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' markov model ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Computer Systems Development ', ' ']",NIDA,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2007,133484,0.14345262070792456
"Drug Use, Disorder & HIV/AIDS Risk in Juvenile Justice Youth:A Longitudinal Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the Northwestern Juvenile Project to examine the developmental patterns of drug use and disorder and risk for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as juvenile justice youth age from adolescence to emerging adulthood and young adulthood. This study responds to NIDA's new initiatives in health disparities in HIV/AIDS in minority populations, specifically the nexus of drug abuse, criminal justice involvement, and HIV/AIDS among African Americans.  African Americans comprise 12% of the US population but 40% of incarcerated populations and 50% of new cases of HIV/AIDS. At year-end 2004, nearly 100,000 juveniles and nearly 2.1 million adults were incarcerated. We will continue to study a racially/ethnically diverse sample (n=758; 330 females, 428 males; 412 African Americans, 137 non-Hispanic whites, 207 Hispanics, 2 other race/ethnicity) of persons who were arrested and detained in Cook County (Chicago) Illinois, aged 10-18 years at recruitment (1997-1998). Since recruitment, data have been collected on the development of substance use and disorders, risk and protective factors, and HIV/AIDS risk behaviors. Participants are re-interviewed whether they are (re)incarcerated or back in the community. We propose to conduct annual interviews 10, 11, 12, and 13 years post-baseline, collect records, and test for HIV infection and selected STIs. Focusing on racial/ethnic disparities, gender and age differences, and effects of incarceration, we will: (1) describe patterns of drug use and disorder - onset, persistence, desistence, and recurrence -- as juvenile justice youth age from adolescence to emerging adulthood and young adulthood; (2) describe patterns of HIV/AIDS risk behaviors during this same period; (3) describe the prevalence and incidence of HIV infection and other STIs; and (4) examine the relationship between drug use and disorder and HIV/AIDS risk behaviors. Extending the Northwestern Juvenile Project allows us to leverage the data already collected to examine health disparities and the role of disproportionate minority confinement in the development of drug use and disorder and HIV/AIDS risk; to identify risk and protective factors that are potentially malleable; to identify points of intervention at key developmental periods; and to extend theoretical models - developed in general population adolescents - to correctional populations.           ","Drug Use, Disorder & HIV/AIDS Risk in Juvenile Justice Youth:A Longitudinal

"Long-Term Consequences of Exposure to Family Violence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to identify the extent to which, and the mechanisms through which, exposure to violence in the family might disrupt individual development in adolescence, with consequences that cascade over the life course and affect a subsequent generation. Exposure to family violence is conceptualized broadly to include domestic violence, child abuse, family conflict and exposure to multiple forms of violence. Key outcomes include public health targets of drug use, HIV/AIDS risk and violence. Guided by a developmental life-span model the study will employ prospective data from three generations of subjects in the Rochester Youth Development Study (RYDS). Generation 2, or G2 are the original RYDS cohort of 1000 urban adolescents followed from early adolescence to their early thirties. Their parents, G1 were also interviewed during the first 10 years of the study. Their children (G3) are followed from early childhood into adolescence. Measurement is multi-agent and multimethod, including self-report, observational and official measurement. Specific aims are (1) To describe the incidence and prevalence of types of family violence exposure in two consecutive generations of an urban, community-based sample with a substantial number of high-risk and minority males and females (2) To examine the adolescent impact of different types of violence exposure (and of multiple  exposure) on drug use, risk for HIV/AIDS and other problem behaviors, as well as pro-social competencies. (3) To examine if G2 exposure to family violence leads to drug use and other problems in emerging adulthood, either directly or indirectly via its consequences on adolescent development. (4) To examine long-term consequences of family violence exposure on consolidation of adult roles by the early 30's, especially stable work and family formation and avoidance of drug use and criminal involvement. (5) To examine intergenerational continuity and discontinuity in exposure to family violence. To examine these aims, several statistical strategies including growth curve modeling and full and limited information SEM will be used.

"Spatial Variations in IDU HIV Risk: Relationship to Structural Interventions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The likelihood that illicit drug users will engage in drug-related HIV risk behaviors or suffer adverse drug-related health outcomes varies considerably across neighborhoods. While an emerging line of research has investigated whether particular neighborhood-level characteristics (e.g., presence of dilapidated housing and social disorder) determines neighborhood-level variation in these drug-related behaviors and health outcomes, no research has yet studied whether syringe access (SA) programs or drug-related criminal justice (D-RCJ) activities contribute to neighborhood-level variations in drug-related behaviors and health outcomes among illicit drug users, including injection drug users (IDUs). This absence is striking: (1) SA programs and D-RCJ activities affect patterns of drug-related health behaviors, outcomes, and service use; (2) SA programs and D- RCJ activities are place-based, structural interventions: they are unevenly distributed across neighborhoods and shape the local context in which IDUs use drugs; and (3) D-RCJ activities (and possibly SA programs) exert different impacts on drug-related HIV risk behaviors and health service use among IDUs of different racial/ethnic groups. Explaining racial/ethnic variations in drug-related HIV risk and health service use is a NIDA priority. Current measures of SA programs and D-RCJ activities, however, preclude studying whether these interventions shape geographic variation in drug-related HIV risk behaviors, health outcomes and service use among IDUs. The proposed exploratory study will achieve 3 aims by analyzing existing data: to (1a) Construct new measures of SA programs and D-RCJ activities as place-based, structural, and multidimensional interventions; and (1b) Apply these measures to describe variations in SA programs and D- RCJ activities over time (1995-2006) across NYC's 42 health districts. By applying spatial analysis methods we will calculate, for each NYC health district and year, spatial access to syringes and to SA programs (overall and by program type); and intensity of drug-related arrest, incarceration, and police surveillance. (2) Use multilevel methods to explore whether variations in these measures across health districts and time are related to variations among IDUs in drug-related HIV risk behaviors and health service use across districts and time. (3) Explore if variations in these district-level measures create variations in drug-related HIV risk behaviors and service use, both within and between racial/ethnic groups of IDUs. The proposed project will lay the foundations for future investigations of the ways that SA programs and D-RCJ activities shape neighborhood- level variations in a wide range of health behaviors (e.g., HIV sexual risk), outcomes (e.g., HIV transmission), and service use (e.g., drug treatment entry) among IDU populations in multiple cities. Research based on these measures may provide important insight into how to modify SA programs and D-RCJ activities so as to reduce morbidity and mortality among drug users, their sex partners, and neighbors. Public Health Relevance Statement Rates of drug-related HIV risk behaviors and adverse drug-related health outcomes vary across neighborhoods in a city. No research has yet explored whether syringe access (SA) programs or drug-related criminal justice (D-RCJ) activities affect this neighborhood-level variation. The proposed project will construct measures of SA programs and D-RCJ activities that will allow us to explore whether these programs and activities create neighborhood-level variation in key drug-related health behaviors, outcomes, and service use in a city, and will empirically test whether changes in SA programs and D-RCJ activities in one US city (NYC) are associated with (1) neighborhood-level variation in drug injectors' drug-related HIV risk behaviors and health service use and (2) racial/ethnic variations in these outcomes. Project-created measures of SA programs and D-RCJ activities can be applied to other cities, and can be used to analyze neighborhood-level variations in a wide range of health behaviors, outcomes, and service use among injectors (e.g., sexual risk behaviors, HIV or HCV transmission, drug treatment entry). Research based on these measures may provide important insight into how to modify SA programs and D-RCJ activities so as to reduce morbidity and mortality among drug users, their sex partners, and neighbors. Given concerns that SA programs adversely affect local quality of life, project measures can also be used to empirically test the relationship between SA program presence in a neighborhood and local crime rates and other adverse social outcomes.          ",Spatial Variations in IDU HIV Risk: Relationship to Structural Interventions,7283879,R21DA023391,"['Crime ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' geographic difference ', ' geographic variation ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Legal ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Range ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Housing ', ' Area ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' insight ', ' Linear Models ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Legal Status ', ' Inequality ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Needle-Exchange Programs ', ' needle exchange ', ' Syringe-Exchange Programs ', ' Funding ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxication ', ' detoxification ', ' Metabolism of Toxic Agents ', ' Metabolic Drug Detoxications ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxification ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' National Research Council (U.S.) ', ' National Research Council ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Shapes ', ' Drug user ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Condition ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rosa ', ' Rose ', ' Sales ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Syringes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Behavior ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' Services ', ' Participant ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Measures ', ' Needle Sharing ', ' Syringe Sharing ', ' Needlesharing ', ' Police ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' Latino ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Hepatitis C Transmission ', ' hepatitis C virus transmission ', ' HCV Transmission ', ' Outcome ', ' drug distribution ', ' Population ', ' administrative database ', ' administrative data base ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' ']",NIDA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2007,229763,0.05989522887805168
"PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative (MARI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The proposed study's overarching goal is to reduce the ethnic disparities in HIV infection between Hispanic and non-Hispanic youth living in Miami-Dade County, an HIV epicenter. This goal will be accomplished by two aims: AIM 1 is to develop and manualize a one-and-a-half- month streamlined version of an efficacious HIV preventive intervention entitled Familias Unidas; and AIM II is to evaluate the efficacy of the streamlined version of Familias Unidas plus an HIV Prevention School CurriculumTreatment as Usual, relative to the HIV Prevention School Curriculum Treatment as Usual only, in preventing drug use and unprotected sexual behavior, two risk factors for HIV infection. Familias Unidas aims to prevent drug use and unprotected sexual behavior by (a) increasing family functioning, (b) increasing parental monitoring of peer activities, and (c) influencing adolescent social cognitive mechanisms regarding drug use and unsafe sexual behavior. A sample of 240 Hispanic 9th grade adolescents and their primary caregivers will be randomized to one of two conditions: Familias Unidas plus the HIV School Curriculum Treatment as Usual (hereafter refererred to as Familias Unidas) or the HIV Prevention School Curriculum Treatment as Usual only. Two studies have demonstrated the efficacy of an intensive, 9 to 12 month version of Familias Unidas. In the first study, Familias Unidas was shown to be efficacious relative to a no- intervention control condition in increasing family functioning. In the second study, Familias Unidas was found to be efficacious in preventing drug use and unsafe sexual behavior relative to two attention control conditions. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) will be used to test: (H1) Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than the HIV Prevention School Curriculum Treatment as Usual in preventing adolescent drug use over time and (H2) Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than the HIV Prevention School Curriculum Treatment as Usual in preventing adolescent unprotected sexual behavior over time. Additionally HLM will be used to determine whether (H1a) the effect of Familias Unidas on drug use will be partially mediated by (1) family functioning; (2) parental monitoring of peers; and (3) social cognitive mechanisms regarding drug use; and (H2a) the effect of Familias Unidas on unprotected sexual behavior will be partially mediated by (1) family functioning; (2) parental monitoring of peers; (3) social cognitive mechanisms regarding unprotected sex; and (4) drug use. The objective of the proposed study is to reduce HIV contraction health disparities in Hispanic populations. The knowledge expected to be gained from this study will aid in the development of interventions to reduce drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and HIV in Hispanic adolescents.           ","PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative (MARI)",7392512,U01PS000671,[''],NCHHSTP,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2007,220035,0.10409011619734354
"Barriers to Treatment-based HIV Prevention for IDU Couples    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite recent advances in HIV prevention, injecting drug users (IDUs) in the U.S. still account for 1/3 of new infections. Racial/ethnic disparities in injection drug use also continue to cause a disproportionate share of new HIV cases among minorities and women. This proposal targets a vulnerable and understudied population of IDUs - minority, heterosexual, IDU couples (i.e. partnered IDUs). While research on partnered IDUs is scarce, existing literature indicates that partnered IDUs are at high risk for HIV from both drug- related and sexual risk behaviors. Partnered IDUs, especially partnered women IDUs, also have limited success in reducing drug use, accessing or completing drug abuse treatment, and maintaining treatment outcomes (reduced drug use, safer drug-use practices, safer sex). This profile of partnered IDUs has important implications for treatment-based HIV prevention. Drug abuse treatment is an effective method for reducing drug-and sex-related HIV risk among IDUs. A recent NIDA publication concludes that ""drug abuse treatment is HIV prevention."" However, the median proportion of IDUs who access treatment in the U.S. is extremely low - less than 9%. Clearly, the full efficacy of HIV prevention cannot be realized unless more IDUs enter treatment. Since a substantial number of IDUs are sexually partnered with other IDUs (more than 40%, according to out own NYC data), understanding and overcoming barriers to successful treatment and treatment-based HIV prevention among partnered IDUs will have a substantial impact on reducing drug use and HIV risk, especially among minority women. This qualitative study of IDU couples and treatment providers focuses on two sets of barriers to drug treatment and treatment-based HIV risk reduction among African American and Latino heterosexual IDU couples in NYC: (1) relationship dynamics among partnered IDUs that deter treatment entry, retention or the maintenance of outcomes; and (2) couples-specific structural barriers in the treatment system that further inhibit treatment entry, retention, and the maintenance of outcomes. We are also interested in (3) how these two kinds of barriers interact. Findings from the proposed research will inform subsequent work to quantify these barriers and develop and evaluate programs to overcome them. This study is proposed by a new investigator and utilizes the R-21 mechanism. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT HIV transmission among injection drug users (IDUs) continues to be an important public health issue. Despite recent advances in HIV prevention, injection drug users in the U.S. still account for 1/3 of all new infections. Racial/ethnic disparities in injection drug use also continue to cause a disproportionate share of infections. The proposed study primarily targets African American and Latino IDUs who are partnered in intimate relationships. While research on partnered IDUs is scarce, existing literature indicates that they are at high risk for HIV from both drug-related and sexual risk behaviors.

"The Center for the Study and Prevention of Drug Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This proposal for the Center for Study and Prevention of Drug Use is submitted by Morgan State University and seeks funding under the PAR-02-016 mechanism in response to the PA entitled ""Minority Institutions' Drug Abuse Research Development Program"" (MIDARP). The proposed Center will be an inter-institutional collaborative effort involving Morgan State University, a minority institution, and research intensive universities and programmatic initiatives that focus on and specialize in research on drug use and disparities associated with drug use. The Center seeks to build on the collaborative relationships established through the Center to increase the capacity of Morgan State, its faculty and its students to conduct rigorous drug use research with and emphasis on drug use epidemiology, public health, and health disparities related to drug use. In order to actualize the mission of the Center, four components were developed which address the necessary aspects of creating a drug use research center. 1) The Faculty Development Plan, which seeks to advance Morgan faculty by allowing them to engage in off-site collaborative research with individuals specializing in drug research. 2) A second aspect is the Student Development Plan, which seeks to expose, educate and, train minority students in the area of drug use research. 3) The research arm of the project includes a primary and four developmental pilot project, allowing researchers at Morgan to begin using their present expertise and investigating topics in the area of drug use and disparities related to drug use. 4) Overseeing, each of the areas is the proposed plan for the Administrative Units and Center Organization. Through this component collaborative relationships, research projects, and faculty and student development will be monitored and enhanced. As a result of the Center faculty at Morgan State will be further enhanced regarding their ability to conduct rigorous research independently, specifically submitting R01's. Further, Morgan will be sufficiently capable of training students for careers in drug use research by developing a structured program in drug research, and the administrative staff will have the skills necessary to support the research staff in all endeavors related to research projects. In sum, the Center will be; self-sustaining and capable of producing future research focused on drug use research.               ",The Center for the Study and Prevention of Drug Use,7235614,R24DA019805,"['drug abuse prevention ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Commit ', ' Institution ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Sum ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Preparation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Support of Research ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' career ', ' Grant ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Internships ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Development Plans ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Funding ', ' Maryland ', ' Mentors ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Mission ', ' New Jersey ', ' New York ', ' Collaborations ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Scientist ', ' Universities ', ' Washington ', ' Writing ', ' Award ', ' Upper arm ', ' Country ', ' Baltimore ', ' Behavior ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' high school ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' forging ', ' Minority ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' ']",NIDA,MORGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R24,2007,681501,0.2289119318721305
"Trajectories of Drugs Abuse in High Risk Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the Northwestern Juvenile Project to examine the dynamic relationships among patterns of drug use and disorder, risk and protective factors for drug use and disorder, and adult social role performance as juvenile justice youth age from adolescence to emerging adulthood and young adulthood. This study responds to NIDA's new initiatives on drug abuse, health disparities, and disproportionate minority confinement of African Americans. At year-end 2004, nearly 100,000 juveniles and nearly 2.1 million adults were incarcerated. African Americans comprise 12% of the US population but 40% of incarcerated populations. We are studying a racially/ethnically diverse sample (n=1709; 624 females, 1085 males) in Cook County (Chicago) Illinois, aged 10-18 years at recruitment (1995-1998). Youth are reinterviewed whether they are (re)incarcerated or back in the community. Our goal is to focus on gender differences, racial/ethnic disparities, and the effect of incarceration as we: (1) describe patterns of drug use and disorder --onset, persistence, desistence, and recurrence - as juvenile justice youth age from adolescence to emerging and young adulthood; (2) examine how risk and protective factors (e.g., comorbid mental disorders, adverse life events, availability of illicit drugs) predict, moderate, and mediate patterns of drug use and disorders; and (3) examine the dynamic relationships between patterns of drug use and disorder and adult social role performance (e.g., residential independence [including avoiding incarceration], employment, marriage, parenting, desistance from crime and violence). To analyze the longitudinal data, we will use summary statistics (e.g., prevalence rates, odds ratios), generalized linear mixed-effects models, survival analyses, and Muthen's recently developed extensions of growth mixture models. Extending the Northwestern Juvenile Project allows us to leverage the data already collected to examine the role of incarceration in the development of drug use and disorder, especially among African Americans; to identify risk and protective factors that are potentially malleable; to identify points of intervention at key developmental periods; and to extend theoretical models - developed in general population adolescents -- to correctional populations.           ",Trajectories of Drugs Abuse in High Risk Youth,7212925,R01DA019380,"['Odds Ratio ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', '

"Tailored Youth Drug Intervention in Primary Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Preventing the initiation, and reducing the escalation of marijuana use among adolescents can have a major impact on the development of problem behaviors and health consequences in adulthood. The varying factors associated with initiation and escalation of marijuana use among adolescents (age 12-18) speaks to the importance of tailoring preventive approaches based on individual risk factors. Brief motivational interventions (BMI) have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing drug use (i.e., marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco) among adolescents and young adults. Typically, BMIs are delivered by a clinician; however, more recently, computers have been used successfully to deliver BMI in an interactive, graphically engaging format. The primary care setting represents an underutilized venue for prevention interventions addressing drug use/abuse among youth. This study will take place in three HRSA-funded Bureau of Primary Health Care community health clinics located in Flint, Michigan, a city with a diverse and medically under-served population. The purpose of this five-year study is to: (1) develop and refine promising, empirically-derived, BMI prevention/intervention modules delivered by a clinician or a computer to target marijuana use, and (2) test the effectiveness of BMI in preventing initiation/escalation of marijuana use among youth in community health clinics. The proposed BMI prevention/interventions are innovative because: a) they incorporate tailoring technology based on assessment of the adolescents' behaviors; and b) they incorporate prevention messages for those who have not initiated use, and intervention messages for those who are current users. This randomized controlled trial will screen 1,710 adolescents in primary care clinics over 30 months. A random sample of the approximately 70% who screen negative for past year marijuana use will be selected to participate in the study (n=450); all subjects who screen positive for past year use will be enrolled in the study (n=450). These 900 subjects will be stratified by gender, age, and past year marijuana use and randomized to one of three conditions: 1) computer-delivered brief motivational approach (BMI-C) (n=300; 150 non-users: prevention, 150 users: intervention); 2) therapist-delivered brief motivational approach (BMI-T) (n=300; 150 non-users, 150 users); or 3) a NIDA drug education booklet (DPB) (n=300; 150 non-users, 150 users). Primary outcomes will be evaluated at 3-, 6- and 12-months and include marijuana, alcohol, tobacco and other drug use. Key moderators of effectiveness will be examined, including behavioral intentions, self-efficacy, stage of change, school involvement, susceptibility to peer pressure, and potential health consequences (e.g., STD/HIV risk behaviors). This project will provide the critical first step toward the implementation of tailored marijuana prevention and intervention in primary care clinics.

"Service Use, ATI Program Outcomes, and Pro-Social Change    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        This application details a proposal for a prospective longitudinal panel study with a random sample of 360 individuals attending alternative to incarceration (ATI) programs in New York City (NYC) that serve drug-involved offenders. The proposed study focuses on (1) the impact of utilization of formal healthcare and psychosocial services on outcomes of ATI program completion, recidivism, technical violations (i.e., lawbreaking behaviors not resulting in re-incarceration), and pro-social change (e.g., fulfilling child- and elder-caretaking roles); and (2) factors affecting service utilization among ATI program participants. The study fulfills several recommendations from the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Health Service Research at NIDA, including broadening both (a) the venues of drug abuse services research to include programs in ""nontraditional"" settings, especially the criminal justice system, and (b) the range of needs and characteristics of subgroups that are studied in order to address a fuller ""continuum of care and patient groups."" The Task Force's recommendations echoed other calls regarding the need to elucidate mediators of success of treatment, especially those in nontraditional settings such as criminal justice programs for drug-involved offenders. Also consistent with the Task Force report, the proposed research will employ new data analysis methods for causal inference using observational data. The significance and feasibility of the proposed study are substantiated by findings from a pilot study successfully completed by the investigators. For the proposed study, we will recruit individuals at the start of their participation in ATI programs designed for adult, drug-involved offenders in NYC, conducting structured interviews every 3 months over the course of 18 months for each participant. Aims, hypotheses, and measurements are guided by the Network Episode Model, an innovative model that conceptualizes access and attendance of formal services as a time-varying behavior driven by level of need and shaped by dynamic processes involving individual/social context factors and service system experiences. The proposed study is designed to achieve the following primary aims: (1) To examine the causal relationship between service utilization and (a) ATI program completion, (b) recidivism, (c) technical violations, and (d) pro-social change; and (2) To identify and estimate the causal impact of factors that influence access and utilization of formal services among ATI participants. Findings will generate substantive and practical implications for researchers and professionals in the areas of drug abuse, services research, criminal justice, and public health in developing and testing future interventions and programs for drug-involved offenders. The proposed study will be conducted by Dr. Elwin Wu and Dr. Nabila EI-Bassel of the Social Intervention Group at the Columbia University School of Social Work.             ","Service Use, ATI

"Child Welfare, Drug Abuse and Intergenerational Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        We seek to establish a program of research on Child Welfare, Drug Abuse and Intergenerational Risk (CWDAIR) based in the School of Social Welfare (SSW) at the University at Albany. The goal is to advance research on the development and delivery of coordinated, evidence-based and theoretically-oriented services for parents in the child welfare system with addiction and co-occurring problems including HIV/AIDS. The focus on substance abuse in conjunction with HIV/AIDS within child welfare families is timely, appropriate, and significant since children in these families face significant barriers to healthy development. Improved and more integrated services for parents will reduce the risk of drug abuse and other negative outcomes in the next generation. The CWDAIR Program has two specific aims: first, to build an infrastructure for conducting interdisciplinary research on drug abuse and HIV/AIDS in child welfare families, including the development and support of interdisciplinary research teams based in SSW; and second, to develop collaborative partnerships with state agency leaders and professionals from child welfare, HIV/AlDS, and substance abuse services to improve the design of services to address substance abuse and co-occurring problems among high risk parents. The research program will support high impact collaborative research leading to R01, R03 and K awards, better services for high-risk families, and reduced intergenerational transfer of risk.       In order to achieve Program aims, a capacity-building infrastructure development is planned. Specifically the CWDAIR Program will: (1) launch an intensive faculty development program of seminars and training focused upon crosscutting child welfare, HIV/AIDS and substance abuse interventions; critical collaboration issues; improved services to racially and ethnically diverse families; and state of the art methodologies (2) provide methodological and computer support, training, and pilot project supports to foster the development of fundable research projects, especially involving junior faculty and doctoral students (3) support two initial pilot projects designed with interdisciplinary and community consultation, (4) seed a mini-grants program designed to further develop collaborative research projects among community practitioners, faculty from other disciplines within and beyond the University at Albany and SSW faculty, (5) design and implement an infrastructure evaluation system that identifies key lessons learned, informs subsequent stages of infrastructure and blended research development and (6) advance dissemination and communication through web-pages, listservs, research briefs, presentations and publications.         ","Child

"Community Vulnerability and Responses to IDU-Related HIV  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this competing continuation, we will conduct a longitudinal study (1993-2007) of 96 large metropolitan areas to study trends and predictors of changes in the population prevalence of drug injectors, HIV) prevalence among injectors, and related prevention programs. In stage one of this project, we developed ways to estimate the population density of injection drug use and HIV prevalence rates in metropolitan areas. We showed that per capita injection drug use increased during the 1990s in many localities, including Baltimore and Salt Lake City. HIV prevalence rates among drug injectors increased in Baltimore and some other areas. In many metropolitan areas, drug injection and HIV rates among injectors declined. The extent to which local HIV prevention programs reached drug injectors also varied widely: 3 metropolitan areas provided treatment to 20% or more of their injectors, while 13 areas reached less than 5%. HIV counseling and testing rates also varied widely. In cross-sectional analyses, we showed that local government budgetary decisions, social and economic factors, and drug abuse interventions were related to injection drug users per capita, HIV revalence among drug injectors, and the presence and size of various programs to prevent HIV among drug injectors. We will build upon our existing data and construct a database for these 96 metropolitan areas containing annual estimates from 1993 - 2007 of drug injectors per capita; HIV prevalence, incident AIDS cases and AIDS mortality among drug injectors; program availability and size; socioeconomic conditions, and government budgetary allocations. We will (1) describe patterns of change over time in prevention programs and epidemiology. We will use longitudinal analysis methods to study (2) how changing socioeconomic conditions, epidemiologic need, budgetary constraints and choices, and policy choices are related to subsequent HIV prevention programming; and (3) how all these variables are related to later changes in (a) drug injectors per capita, (b) HIV prevalence and AIDS among drug injectors, (c) drug abuse treatment and other programs for drug injectors, and (d) racial/ethnic disparities in appropriate indicators. We will use these analyses to develop a well-theorized scientific understanding of forces that shape metropolitan area HIV/AIDS epidemics, rates of drug injectors per capita, and prevention programs. The resulting scientific knowledge base can help develop programs and policies so as to avoid epidemics and, if needed, control them.

"The neighborhood environment and drug use in NYC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proposed is a study is to assess the relations between neighborhood characteristics (e.g., neighborhood disadvantage, collective efficacy, residential segregation) and drug use behavior among residents of New York City while controlling for relevant individual-level factors. A secondary purpose of this study is to determine the relation between key neighborhood characteristics and the medical consequences of drug use, particularly fatal drug overdose. Recent work has shown that neighborhood characteristics are associated with the likelihood of drug use, abuse, and dependence and that research focusing exclusively on individual patterns of drug use is insufficient to fully explain inter-individual drug use behavior. Here we propose a systematic collection of data to characterize neighborhoods in a large metropolitan area and to test key hypotheses that may explain inter-individual variability in drug use behavior and its consequences.   Understanding how neighborhood factors affect drug use risk behavior can guide interventions that aim to mitigate drug use and its consequences, to create a social environment that better facilitates users to seek treatment, and to improve overall population health. In order to achieve the aims of this study we will use data from three sources: (i) We will collect data on individual drug use behavior (focusing on cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use) through a random digit-dial phone survey of 5,000 New York City residents, geo-coding and mapping each respondent to their neighborhood of residence; (ii) we will compile a contextual database characterizing New York City neighborhoods using information collected in the survey and using archival data (collected from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Department of City Planning, Police Department, US Census and other sources); and (iii) we will combine this data with data from a NIDA funded study of drug overdose over time (DA 06534; principal investigator: Tardiff, a consultant on this project). We will test key hypotheses about the relations between neighborhood characteristics and drug use, abuse, and dependence using multi-level hierarchical models. We have recently completed several studies of New York City neighborhoods that serve as preliminary exploration of the key hypotheses of this study. This, coupled with our studies involving telephone interviews with 6,000+ New Yorkers is assurance that the aims of this study can be achieved.

"Gender Differences in Healthcare and Drug Treatment Utilization among Drug Users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the course of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, women (particularly African-American and Hispanic women) have been increasingly affected. Women now account for 1 in every 3 newly reported cases of HIV infection in the U.S., with two major modes of transmission: heterosexual contact and injection drug use. Research has documented a gender disparity in health care and drug treatment utilization. For example, compared with men, drug-using women receive less medical and psychiatric services, although they have poorer physical and mental health. Drug-using women also have lower retention and treatment completion rates than men in substance abuse treatment. In addition, drug-using women with HIV are less likely than men to receive HIV medication and to adhere to HAART. The factors contributing to these gender differences in minority communities are not fully understood and deserve elucidation through research. The proposed study, using existing dual-site longitudinal data, will examine factors related to gender differences in health care and drug use treatment utilization among Puerto Rican IDUs and crack smokers, a group at high risk for HIV. The two sites studied (New York and Puerto Rico) will provide a comparison of gender disparities in health care, for the same ethnic group in two communities with different resource contexts. The specific aims of the proposed study are: 1) To examine, by gender, factors associated with health care utilization among Puerto Rican drug users in NY and PR; 2) to identify (a) factors mediating the relationship between gender and health care utilization, and (b) interaction effects with gender in the relationships with health care utilization; 3) to examine, by gender, factors associated with drug treatment utilization; 4) to identify (a) factors mediating the relationship between gender and drug treatment utilization, and (b) interaction effects with gender in the relationships with drug treatment utilization; and 5) to assess how the relationships above (#1 - #4) vary between two different health resource environments. In addition, the study will assess whether predictors of HIV medication use differ between women and men over time. The major statistical analyses used will be: multiple logistic regression and hierarchical linear modeling (for longitudinal analysis). Findings will be useful in developing gender-specific interventions to improve health care and drug treatment utilization in women. Gender disparities in health care (including drug treatment) utilization are important public health issues. In particular, among minority drug-using populations, women, as compared to men, receive less medical and psychiatric services, although they experience poorer physical and mental health. However, the factors contributing to these gender differences in minority communities remain under-studied. The proposed study will contribute to an understanding of gender-differentiated healthcare behaviors, and further lead to recommendations to narrow the gender gap.             ",Gender Differences

"STI/HIV Risk, Services, and Drug Use For Young Arrestees DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Large numbers of drug-involved adolescents enter the juvenile justice system at risk for the sexually transmitted infections (STIs) chlamydia and gonorrhea, treatable and often asymptomatic bacterial infections that increase HIV risk. However, current STI surveillance for juvenile offenders is symptom-based and typically limited to correctional facilities (although most juvenile offenders are not incarcerated), resulting in many undetected cases that increase public health risk. Designing and expanding more effective STI health interventions require data on how STI infection among all delinquents (not just those incarcerated) is related to drug use and risk behaviors. Moreover, few STI/HIV risk reduction interventions have been implemented for adolescent offenders in the community. Thus, there is a need to further our understanding of drug use and sex risk behaviors among youth at the ""front end"" of the juvenile justice system, to develop new screening methods that identify infections early in the juvenile justice process, and to provide more effective prevention and treatment services to a broader segment of this population. This grant proposes to implement an STI assessment and urine screening (for chlamydia and gonorrhea) protocol in the Hillsborough County (FL) Juvenile Assessment Center (JAC); analyze relations among drug use, sex risk behaviors and STI infection rates; and identify STI-related service needs and impediments to expanding STI testing and services for this underserved high-risk population. Future planned research will further explore the STI-related service needs of delinquent youth, and develop, pilot, and implement an STI risk reduction program in a controlled clinical trial. Data from an Intake Assessment and STI urine tests will be collected from a sample of 900 eligible delinquent youth consecutively admitted to the JAC (stratified to yield 450 females (an important but understudied subpopulation). Organizational data will be drawn from juvenile justice and service provider records, geocoded data on infections and health service locations, and 40 staff interviews.  Follow-up data on STI treatment and retesting will be collected from the Hillsborough County Health Department for STI-positive participants. JAC and State/County health officials are committed to collaborating with the research team on this and future projects. There are four study aims: AIM 1: To assess STI/HIV risk profiles in high-risk juvenile offenders (i.e. active drug users and those at risk for drug use) and compare them to low-risk offenders. AIM 2: To identify STI and HIV prevention service needs among juvenile offenders and the organizational and individual barriers to delivering these services. AIM 3: To determine STI (chlamydia and gonorrhea) and self-reported HIV prevalence rates among juvenile offenders entering the juvenile justice system. AIM 4: To determine the percentage of STI-positive youth who return for medical treatment, and analyze the factors associated with provision and receipt of treatment.

"The Growing Disparity in Illegal Drug Use Across Socioeconomic Strata    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A disparity in illegal drug use that disadvantages individuals in the lower socioeconomic strata has significantly increased in the last two decades. New evidence indicates that this increase results in large part from a changing influence of socioeconomic status (SES) on drug use, and not from a negative influence of drug use on SES that has accumulated over time. However, the SES-related influences responsible for this growing disparity remain largely unknown. . The aims of this study are threefold. First, it will address limitations in current evidence on the growing disparity of illegal drug use across socioeconomic strata. Using the most current, available data the project will (a) update analyses of socioeconomic trends in cocaine past 1998 (b) examine socioeconomic trends up to the present in illegal drugs that have not yet been examined, such as marijuana, methamphetamine, ecstasy, and 'blunts,1 (c) examine whether the growing disparity sterns from differential incidence and/or differential duration of drug use across socioeconomic strata, and (d) examine SES indicators other than education. These analyses will use the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, a nationally- representative, cross-sectional survey of drug use administered yearly, although between 1979 and 1988 it was administered only every third year. Second, the study will predict both changes in the prevalence of illegal drugs over time and also changes in the characteristics of illegal drug users over time. We use a ""Diffusion of Innovation"" framework, which predicts that users of an innovation such as illegal drugs fall into distinct categories such as ""innovators,"" ""early adopters,"" and ""late adopters."" People in each of these categories are theorized to differ from each other in terms of sociodemographic, psychological, and environmental characteristics. Furthermore, the profiles of drug users at one point in time are expected to predict the prevalence of drug use in the future. The third aim of the project is to trace the extent to which the key predictors of illegal drug use, as highlighted by the Diffusion framework, have their roots in the early life course. Using a longitudinal survey that has followed 838 children from 1st grade to age 30, the analysis will examine how far back in the life course current predictors of illegal drug use extend. We expect that many early predictors have not yet been linked to later drug use because the current profile of illegal drug users, which includes factors such as low socioeconomic status, did not emerge until recently. Results from this project will inform policy and intervention programs aimed at reducing the prevalence of illegal drug use across all socioeconomic strata.              ",The Growing Disparity in Illegal Drug Use Across Socioeconomic Strata,7658447,R01DA020575,"['Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Adopted ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' directed attention ', ' directs attention ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' intervention program ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' falls ', ' Causations ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cocaine ', ' 8-Azabicyclo(3.2.1)octane-2-carboxylic acid, 3-(benzoyloxy)-8-methyl-, methyl ester, (1R-(exo,exo))- ', ' Accounting ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' stem ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' ecstasy ', ' N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine ', ' N,alpha-dimethyl-1,3-benzodioxole-5-ethanamine ', ' Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ', ' MDMA ', ' 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine ', ' Diffusion ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Policy Research ', ' Update ', ' trend ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Funding ', ' Marihuana ', ' marijuana ', ' Methamphetamine ', ' N-Methylamphetamine ', ' Methylamphetamine ', ' Desoxyephedrine ', ' Deoxyephedrine ', ' Crystal Meth ', ' Benzeneethanamine, N,alpha-dimethyl-, (S)- ', ' Drug user ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Social Mobility ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2008,39291,0.22637589368278796
"African American Female Drug Users: HIV, Health Disparities, & Criminality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this study is to understand how drug use and criminality are related to health disparities, particularly HIV, and service utilization among African American drug using and non-drug using women across criminal justice status. While drug use is similar across racial groups in the US, African Americans are disproportionately more likely to experience severe health consequences and criminal involvement as a result of drug misuse. Adequate health care may not be received by African American female offenders because they experience the burden of their race, class, gender, and criminal offender status. There is limited scientific data to help understand the linkages between health disparities such as HIV, untreated drug abuse, barriers to service utilization, and status as a criminal offender among African American females. This study is significant because of its potential to identify differences in health disparities and service utilization among African American drug using and non-drug using women in selected levels of criminal justice status (intensive correctional supervision-prison (n=200), moderate correctional supervision-jail (n=200), community supervision-probation (n=200), and no criminal justice involvement (n=200)). All 800 African American females will be followed longitudinally for three 6-month intervals to examine health status and the use of health services across time. The specific aims are: (1) To describe the prevalence of health problems among African American women across criminal justice status and drug use status; (2) To determine the cultural, predisposing, historical health, and potential enabling factors that are predictors of health problems among African American drug using and non-drug using women across criminal justice status over 18 months; (3) To describe the prevalence of untreated health problems, the patterns of health services utilization, and the cultural barriers to service utilization among African American women across criminal justice status and drug use status; and (4) To examine the factors that predict the likelihood of using health services among African American drug using and non-drug using women across criminal justice status over 18 months. The significance of this study includes the potential to provide criminal justice systems-level data for health planning and health policy for prevention, intervention, and treatment of African American female drug users.       This study is significant to the public health field because of its potential to understand the severity of health disparities among African American women across criminal justice status and drug use status and to predict health status and the use of health services over time. This knowledge of African American females can be used as a foundation for future criminal justice systems-level interventions to increase the use of preventative health care and subsequently reduce the need for expensive medical services, as well as to decrease HIV risk behaviors including drug use, unprotected sex, and recidivism.          ","African American Female Drug Users: HIV, Health

"Drug Use, Disorder & HIV/AIDS Risk in Juvenile Justice Youth:A Longitudinal Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the Northwestern Juvenile Project to examine the developmental patterns of drug use and disorder and risk for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as juvenile justice youth age from adolescence to emerging adulthood and young adulthood. This study responds to NIDA's new initiatives in health disparities in HIV/AIDS in minority populations, specifically the nexus of drug abuse, criminal justice involvement, and HIV/AIDS among African Americans.  African Americans comprise 12% of the US population but 40% of incarcerated populations and 50% of new cases of HIV/AIDS. At year-end 2004, nearly 100,000 juveniles and nearly 2.1 million adults were incarcerated. We will continue to study a racially/ethnically diverse sample (n=758; 330 females, 428 males; 412 African Americans, 137 non-Hispanic whites, 207 Hispanics, 2 other race/ethnicity) of persons who were arrested and detained in Cook County (Chicago) Illinois, aged 10-18 years at recruitment (1997-1998). Since recruitment, data have been collected on the development of substance use and disorders, risk and protective factors, and HIV/AIDS risk behaviors. Participants are re-interviewed whether they are (re)incarcerated or back in the community. We propose to conduct annual interviews 10, 11, 12, and 13 years post-baseline, collect records, and test for HIV infection and selected STIs. Focusing on racial/ethnic disparities, gender and age differences, and effects of incarceration, we will: (1) describe patterns of drug use and disorder - onset, persistence, desistence, and recurrence -- as juvenile justice youth age from adolescence to emerging adulthood and young adulthood; (2) describe patterns of HIV/AIDS risk behaviors during this same period; (3) describe the prevalence and incidence of HIV infection and other STIs; and (4) examine the relationship between drug use and disorder and HIV/AIDS risk behaviors. Extending the Northwestern Juvenile Project allows us to leverage the data already collected to examine health disparities and the role of disproportionate minority confinement in the development of drug use and disorder and HIV/AIDS risk; to identify risk and protective factors that are potentially malleable; to identify points of intervention at key developmental periods; and to extend theoretical models - developed in general population adolescents - to correctional populations.           ","Drug Use, Disorder & HIV/AIDS Risk in Juvenile Justice Youth:A Longitudinal

"Drug Abuse and Crime Across the Life Course in an African American Population    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans are disproportionately represented in national crime statistics for arrests and incarceration as well as victimization, particularly for drug-related and violent offenses. Their involvement in crime often represents only one component of a well-recognized cluster of negative experiences and circumstances including drug use problems, socioeconomic disadvantage and poor physical and mental health, sometimes evident in childhood. The cost to individuals, families, and society is enormous, yet we know little about the development of these patterns across the life course. Despite these evident disparities, few studies have examined the development of drug use and criminal behaviors over time within African American community populations, especially into mid adulthood. We intend to study the timing and sources of risk over the life span to better understand the disparities in health and social consequences related to criminal justice issues among African Americans. To that end, we request support to analyze existing crime and drug data covering 35 years in the lives of a cohort of first grade, African American children from inner city Chicago. This prospective developmental study (the Woodlawn project) began in 1966-67, with the most recent follow up in 2002-3 at ages 42-43, and interim assessments in adolescence and early adulthood (age 32-33). The study population had high levels of drug use and criminal activity in adulthood. In the proposed project, we will focus on interrelationships of drug abuse and crime, examining predictors and consequences of drug abuse, criminal activity, and involvement with the criminal justice system. Using data from cohort members, mothers, interviewers, and official criminal records, we will identify 1) patterns of drug use and criminal behaviors over the life course; 2) individual and contextual predictors of later drug use, criminal activity/behaviors, and involvement with the criminal justice system; 3) social, economic, and health consequences of drug use, criminal behaviors, and involvement in the criminal justice system. Of particular interest is how drug use in adolescence and early adulthood relates to the risk of being arrested and incarcerated and, conversely, how early arrests and incarceration influence later drug use and criminal behaviors. This information will further our understanding of the etiology and consequences of crime and drug use into mid adulthood, and inform the design of interventions at various stages along the life course.             ",Drug Abuse and Crime Across the Life Course in an African American Population,7462657,R01DA022366,"['Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Rate ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' criminal behavior ', ' Health ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Interviewer ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Individual ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Staging ', ' Condition ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Life ', ' Victimization ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' interest ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' social integration ', ' cohort ', ' intervention program ', ' member ', ' Population Study ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Chicago ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Sampling ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' Social Functioning ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' ']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,469166,0.19747166288874865
"PRESCRIBING PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS TO YOUTH: CULTURAL FACTORS IN PARENTAL ATTITUDES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes the first study to examine whether culturally related constructs explain ethnic and racial differences in parents' willingness to prescribe psychotropic drugs to youth. Despite 20 years of increasing prescriptions to minors, Black and Latino children remain half as likely as White children to receive medication. Socio-demographic and clinical variables do not account for the difference, which parallels findings of greater Black and Latino skepticism toward psychotropic medication. ""Cultural factors"" are said to explain the difference, but they have rarely been theorized or measured directly in large non-clinical and clinical samples of parents. Familism, traditionalism, fatalism, religiosity, beliefs about causes of youth disorders, perceived psychiatric medication treatment of youth stigma, acceptability of corporal punishment, and acceptability of psychotropic medication may be such factors. If so, then they should mediate the relationship between ethnicity/race and willingness to prescribe. The study will test this assumption using attitudinal and socio-demographic data collected during telephone interviews in English and Spanish with 1224 Black, Latino, and White parents or guardians of 5-17-year-old children, drawn by random-digit dialing from one ethnically diverse South Florida county. The sample will be stratified by ethnicity and race, with each of three equal-sized strata (n=408) further equally stratified by presence (n=204) or absence (n=204) in household of children with emotional or behavior problems, enabling adequate group comparisons to test - both in a general population sample of parents and in a sample of parents whose children might be referred for mental health treatment evaluation - the mediating role of culturally related constructs within a structural equation model. Potentially moderating influences of gender and SES on the model will also be tested. By increasing our ability to interpret ethnic and racial group differences more accurately, we may improve the cultural competence and fit of preventive and clinical interventions aimed at culturally diverse families. Moreover, given an uncertain benefit-to-risk ratio of psychotropic prescriptions to youth, it remains undetermined whether at a population level ethnic and racial differences should be understood as a health disparity favoring the majority because of White youths' greater exposure to drugs' benefits, or, conversely, as a public health advantage for minority youths because of their lesser exposure to drugs' risks. This study takes a logical first step toward exploring culturally embedded reasons for the majority's enthusiasm as well as for minorities' skepticism. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is the first research to date that directly addresses various potential cultural factors that may mediate, in parents, the decision to have psychotropic drugs prescribed to their children. Authors have often suggested that cultural factors play a role in producing observed differences in prescription rates among ethnic and racial groups, but no model so far has specified these possible factors and their relationships. If cultural factors impact psychotropic drug prescription practices with youth, this study will be help to understand these factors more accurately, which could lead to improved outreach, educational, and clinical interventions for families and youths with mental health problems.          ",PRESCRIBING PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS TO YOUTH: CULTURAL FACTORS IN PARENTAL ATTITUDES,7459222,R21MH084832,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Rate ', ' prescription document ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Florida ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' improved ', ' Household ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Evaluation ', ' Distress ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Minor ', ' Respondent ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' prescription procedure ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Exposure to ', ' Psychotropic Drugs ', ' Psychopharmaceuticals ', ' Psychoactive Drugs ', ' Psychoactive Compound ', ' Psychoactive Agents ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Punishment ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stigmata ', ' Knowledge ', ' Testing ', ' Attitude ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' size ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Belief ', ' Equation ', ' Digit structure ', ' Digit ', ' Proxy ', ' parental role ', ' parent role ', ' Agreement ', ' outreach ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Emotional ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Competence ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' comparison group ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 17 year old ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' 18 year old ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' ']",NIMH,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,223650,0.03896925970284357

We are studying a racially/ethnically diverse sample (n=1709; 624 females, 1085 males) in Cook County (Chicago) Illinois, aged 10-18 years at recruitment (1995-1998). Youth are reinterviewed whether they are (re)incarcerated or back in the community. Our goal is to focus on gender differences, racial/ethnic disparities, and the effect of incarceration as we: (1) describe patterns of drug use and disorder --onset, persistence, desistence, and recurrence - as juvenile justice youth age from adolescence to emerging and young adulthood; (2) examine how risk and protective factors (e.g., comorbid mental disorders, adverse life events, availability of illicit drugs) predict, moderate, and mediate patterns of drug use and disorders; and (3) examine the dynamic relationships between patterns of drug use and disorder and adult social role performance (e.g., residential independence [including avoiding incarceration], employment, marriage, parenting, desistance from crime and violence). To analyze the longitudinal data, we will use summary statistics (e.g., prevalence rates, odds ratios), generalized linear mixed-effects models, survival analyses, and Muthen's recently developed extensions of growth mixture models. Extending the Northwestern Juvenile Project allows us to leverage the data already collected to examine the role of incarceration in the development of drug use and disorder, especially among African Americans; to identify risk and protective factors that are potentially malleable; to identify points of intervention at key developmental periods; and to extend theoretical models - developed in general population adolescents -- to correctional populations.           ",Trajectories of Drugs Abuse in High Risk Youth,7502018,R01DA019380,"['Crime ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Healthy People 2010

"HIV - Emergence of Drug Resistance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is to renew a project focused on using mathematical models to understand and predict the emergence of drug resistance to antiretrovirals (ARVs) for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). As the usage rate of ARVs in resource-poor regions is increasing, high levels of drug resistance potentially could emerge and have a devastating impact on public health worldwide, derailing global plans to provide this treatment to many millions of HIV-infected individuals. Our proposed projects will extend the work of the current award, which showed the value of using mathematical models to understand the temporal dynamics of drug-resistant strains of HIV in the United States (US), and for predicting the magnitude of resistance in this setting. In the renewal our work will be extended by combining mathematical modeling with statistical analysis of datasets collected by collaborating groups in the US, Europe and Africa. We will have access to data on drug resistance and important related variables from large scale epidemiological and treatment studies conducted in these three continents. In resource-poor settings, such as Africa, drugs will be limited and thus demand will often greatly exceed supply. We will investigate the problems of allocating ARVs in Africa by using operation research (OR) techniques. We have three Specific Aims. Aim 1: to understand the emergence, explain the present, and predict the evolution of, complex epidemics of drug-resistant strains of HIV in the US and Europe. Aim 2: to predict the evolution of epidemics of drug-resistant strains, as a result of first- line regimens and prophylactic use of ARVs, in Africa. Aim 3: to evaluate the consequences of allocation of scarce HIV healthcare resources in Africa. To achieve this aim we will use models to evaluate the epidemiological and ethical consequences of gender-inequities in access to treatment, assess the epidemiological and ethical impact of treatment priority criteria, and determine healthcare resource allocation strategies that ensure sustainability. Our studies in the renewal will link transmission modeling, OR techniques and statistical analyses; our analyses will take advantage of the extraordinary data sets provided by our collaborators in the US, Europe and Africa.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The emergence and control of drug-resistant strains of HIV is now a global problem. The epidemiology of this problem is complex, and the future of the HIV epidemic is unknown. Our projects focus on using mathematical models to understand, explain, and predict, the evolution of complex epidemics composed of drug-resistant strains of HIV in the US, Europe and Africa. The rollout of antiretrovirals in Africa is just beginning; however demand for drugs greatly exceeds supply. We will, by using mathematical models, evaluate the epidemiological and ethical consequences of allocation of the scarce supply of antiretrovirals in Africa. Our studies are based upon both mathematical modeling and data analyses. Our analyses will take advantage of the extraordinary data sets provided by our collaborators in the US, Europe and Africa. Our results will have direct relevance for health policy makers.          ",HIV - Emergence of Drug Resistance,7495955,R01AI041935,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' microbicide ', '

"HIV Disparities among Drug Users: Neighborhoods, Neurocognition and Sex Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R03 application proposes to conduct secondary data analysis to develop statistical models that explain disparities in HIV/AIDS found among African American and white substance users. In the proposed study, we will employ advance statistical analyses (latent variable mixture models) to consider the separate and synergistic influence of neighborhood factors (drug arrest rates and poverty), substance use patterns and neurocognitive functioning on sexual risk partnerships and, in turn, HIV/AIDS. First, we will evaluate the possible specificity in relationships between distinct neighborhood level factors (segregation, drug markets, poverty) and sexual partnerships and HIV/AIDS. Aim 2 of the study is to model the influence of neighborhood characteristics, substance use patterns, incarceration and neurocognitve functioning on sexual risk partnerships and estimate prevalence and incidence over an18-month period. The third aim is to estimate the magnitude of the association between sexual partnerships and being HIV-infected. The possibility of effect modification is considered with a focus on race and gender. If successful, this project should improve prevention science by: (1) increasing understanding of sexual risk partnerships among drug users and how they vary across race and gender; (2) providing support for considering factors beyond traditional SES indicators when attempting to understand racial disparities in HIV by highlighting the importance of contextual influences of drugs (e.g., rate of drug arrests) on sexual partnerships; and (3) specifying potential neurocognitive processes that might mediate/moderate the relationship between neighborhood, substance use and sexual risk partnerships. This study is the first in a series of innovative studies designed to explain racial disparities and prevent HIV/AIDS among African Americans.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The intersection between substance use and HIV is a major concern as core and peripheral members of drug networks represent a significant portion of HIV/AIDS cases. Although all persons involved in drug networks are at increased risk for HIV, African Americans tend to be disproportionately affected. Because interventions focused solely on the individual have had limited success in slowing the spread of HIV among African Americans, it is important to elucidate the influence and model the pathways through which social and interpersonal factors influence HIV acquisition.          ","HIV Disparities among Drug Users: Neighborhoods, Neurocognition and Sex Behavior",7494882,R03DA024981,"['Crime ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Rate ', ' To specify ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Fellowship ', ' Female ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Peripheral ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Series ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Incidence ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Funding ', ' Study models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Multiple Partners ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Paper ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Drug user ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Science ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Knowledge ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' Time ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' Class ', ' Behavior ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' AIDS/HIV diagnosis ', ' success ', ' member ', ' drug market ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Accounting ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Sex Functioning ', ' sexual functioning ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Neurocognition ', ' person centered ', ' ']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2008,123000,0.004599709383627865
"HIV Infection in Ethnic Minority IDUs: An International Systematic Review    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial/ethnic group disparities in HIV/AIDS are a critical public health issue in the US. These disparities are particularly dramatic with respect to injecting drug use. African-Americans constitute 13% of the US population and 52% of recent US injecting drug use AIDS cases; Hispanics constitute 14% of the US population and 24% of the injecting drug use AIDS cases. These disparities are not the result of more injecting drug users among African-Americans and Hispanics, but of higher rates of HIV infection among African- American and Hispanic IDUs in many areas of the country. Similar disparities-higher rates of HIV infection among ethnic minority IDUs-have also been observed in many foreign countries. Indeed the situation of ethnic minority IDUs in some developing countries can be considered a crisis, with extremely high incidence, prevalence and HIV-related mortality. Disparities have also been observed among non-injecting drug users, with ethnic minority group members having higher rates of HIV infection. The logical next step for addressing these disparities and this epidemiological conundrum is not another individual study, but a systematic review of the large number of relevant studies that have been conducted to date. Our proposed systematic review will use state-of-the-art methods and include the US and the international data on ethnic group differences in HIV infection among drug users. The specific aims include: Developing procedures for combining qualitative and quantitative data from multiple research studies of IDUs in a single geographic area into a ""history of the HIV epidemic among IDUs"" in that area. Determining the frequency of HIV epidemics in which substantial differences in HIV infection have and have not arisen in ethnic minority IDUs vs. ethnic majority IDUs in the US and internationally. Identifying potential causal factors that may generate substantial differences in HIV prevalence among racial/ethnic minority vs. ethnic majority IDUs. Identifying potential causal factors that may perpetuate or reduce differences in HIV infection among racial/ethnic differences over time. Identifying epidemiologic situations in which differences in HIV risk behaviors do or do not statistically ""explain"" differences in HIV infection among racial/ethnic groups of IDUs. The research will also create an extremely rich dataset on HIV infection among ethnic drug uses that will be made available for use by other researchers and HIV prevention service providers. The research addresses one of the most important aspects of HIV/AIDS-the frequent large disparities in HIV infection among ethnic groups in the US and in many other countries. The research will be an innovative application of state of the art methods for systematic review, including extensive searching for published and unpublished studies, quantitative coding of research reports, and applying meta-regression/hierarchical modeling to these problems.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Higher rates of HIV infection among African-American and Hispanic IDUs are a major health disparity in the US. African-Americans comprise 13% of the US population and 52% of injection drug use AIDS cases, Hispanics 14% of the populations and 24% of cases. Similar disparities, higher rates of HIV infection among ethnic minority IDUs, have also been observed in many foreign countries. An international systematic review and meta-analysis should greatly advance our understanding of these disparities and suggest how they might be ameliorated.          ",HIV Infection in Ethnic Minority IDUs: An International Systematic Review,7554760,R01DA024612,"['Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Review, Systematic (PT) ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ethnic group ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Europe ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Rate ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Incidence ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Morbidity -

"The Growing Disparity in Illegal Drug Use Across Socioeconomic Strata    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A disparity in illegal drug use that disadvantages individuals in the lower socioeconomic strata has significantly increased in the last two decades. New evidence indicates that this increase results in large part from a changing influence of socioeconomic status (SES) on drug use, and not from a negative influence of drug use on SES that has accumulated over time. However, the SES-related influences responsible for this growing disparity remain largely unknown. . The aims of this study are threefold. First, it will address limitations in current evidence on the growing disparity of illegal drug use across socioeconomic strata. Using the most current, available data the project will (a) update analyses of socioeconomic trends in cocaine past 1998 (b) examine socioeconomic trends up to the present in illegal drugs that have not yet been examined, such as marijuana, methamphetamine, ecstasy, and 'blunts,1 (c) examine whether the growing disparity sterns from differential incidence and/or differential duration of drug use across socioeconomic strata, and (d) examine SES indicators other than education. These analyses will use the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, a nationally- representative, cross-sectional survey of drug use administered yearly, although between 1979 and 1988 it was administered only every third year. Second, the study will predict both changes in the prevalence of illegal drugs over time and also changes in the characteristics of illegal drug users over time. We use a ""Diffusion of Innovation"" framework, which predicts that users of an innovation such as illegal drugs fall into distinct categories such as ""innovators,"" ""early adopters,"" and ""late adopters."" People in each of these categories are theorized to differ from each other in terms of sociodemographic, psychological, and environmental characteristics. Furthermore, the profiles of drug users at one point in time are expected to predict the prevalence of drug use in the future. The third aim of the project is to trace the extent to which the key predictors of illegal drug use, as highlighted by the Diffusion framework, have their roots in the early life course. Using a longitudinal survey that has followed 838 children from 1st grade to age 30, the analysis will examine how far back in the life course current predictors of illegal drug use extend. We expect that many early predictors have not yet been linked to later drug use because the current profile of illegal drug users, which includes factors such as low socioeconomic status, did not emerge until recently. Results from this project will inform policy and intervention programs aimed at reducing the prevalence of illegal drug use across all socioeconomic strata.              ",The Growing Disparity in Illegal Drug Use Across Socioeconomic Strata,7472489,R01DA020575,"['Schools ', ' Social Mobility ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Adopted ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' directed attention ', ' directs attention ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' intervention program ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' falls ', ' Causations ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cocaine ', ' 8-Azabicyclo(3.2.1)octane-2-carboxylic acid, 3-(benzoyloxy)-8-methyl-, methyl ester, (1R-(exo,exo))- ', ' Accounting ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' stem ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' ecstasy ', ' N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine ', ' N,alpha-dimethyl-1,3-benzodioxole-5-ethanamine ', ' Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ', ' MDMA ', ' 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine ', ' Diffusion ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Policy Research ', ' Update ', ' trend ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Funding ', ' Marihuana ', ' marijuana ', ' Methamphetamine ', ' N-Methylamphetamine ', ' Methylamphetamine ', ' Desoxyephedrine ', ' Deoxyephedrine ', ' Crystal Meth ', ' Benzeneethanamine, N,alpha-dimethyl-, (S)- ', ' Drug user ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2008,250131,0.22637589368278796
"PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative (MARI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The proposed study's overarching goal is to reduce the ethnic disparities in HIV infection between Hispanic and non-Hispanic youth living in Miami-Dade County, an HIV epicenter. This goal will be accomplished by two aims: AIM 1 is to develop and manualize a one-and-a-half- month streamlined version of an efficacious HIV preventive intervention entitled Familias Unidas; and AIM II is to evaluate the efficacy of the streamlined version of Familias Unidas plus an HIV Prevention School CurriculumTreatment as Usual, relative to the HIV Prevention School Curriculum Treatment as Usual only, in preventing drug use and unprotected sexual behavior, two risk factors for HIV infection. Familias Unidas aims to prevent drug use and unprotected sexual behavior by (a) increasing family functioning, (b) increasing parental monitoring of peer activities, and (c) influencing adolescent social cognitive mechanisms regarding drug use and unsafe sexual behavior. A sample of 240 Hispanic 9th grade adolescents and their primary caregivers will be randomized to one of two conditions: Familias Unidas plus the HIV School Curriculum Treatment as Usual (hereafter refererred to as Familias Unidas) or the HIV Prevention School Curriculum Treatment as Usual only. Two studies have demonstrated the efficacy of an intensive, 9 to 12 month version of Familias Unidas. In the first study, Familias Unidas was shown to be efficacious relative to a no- intervention control condition in increasing family functioning. In the second study, Familias Unidas was found to be efficacious in preventing drug use and unsafe sexual behavior relative to two attention control conditions. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) will be used to test: (H1) Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than the HIV Prevention School Curriculum Treatment as Usual in preventing adolescent drug use over time and (H2) Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than the HIV Prevention School Curriculum Treatment as Usual in preventing adolescent unprotected sexual behavior over time. Additionally HLM will be used to determine whether (H1a) the effect of Familias Unidas on drug use will be partially mediated by (1) family functioning; (2) parental monitoring of peers; and (3) social cognitive mechanisms regarding drug use; and (H2a) the effect of Familias Unidas on unprotected sexual behavior will be partially mediated by (1) family functioning; (2) parental monitoring of peers; (3) social cognitive mechanisms regarding unprotected sex; and (4) drug use. The objective of the proposed study is to reduce HIV contraction health disparities in Hispanic populations. The knowledge expected to be gained from this study will aid in the development of interventions to reduce drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and HIV in Hispanic adolescents.           ","PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative (MARI)",7497086,U01PS000671,[''],NCHHSTP,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2008,241887,0.10409011619734354

"Tailored Youth Drug Intervention in Primary Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Preventing the initiation, and reducing the escalation of marijuana use among adolescents can have a major impact on the development of problem behaviors and health consequences in adulthood. The varying factors associated with initiation and escalation of marijuana use among adolescents (age 12-18) speaks to the importance of tailoring preventive approaches based on individual risk factors. Brief motivational interventions (BMI) have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing drug use (i.e., marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco) among adolescents and young adults. Typically, BMIs are delivered by a clinician; however, more recently, computers have been used successfully to deliver BMI in an interactive, graphically engaging format. The primary care setting represents an underutilized venue for prevention interventions addressing drug use/abuse among youth. This study will take place in three HRSA-funded Bureau of Primary Health Care community health clinics located in Flint, Michigan, a city with a diverse and medically under-served population. The purpose of this five-year study is to: (1) develop and refine promising, empirically-derived, BMI prevention/intervention modules delivered by a clinician or a computer to target marijuana use, and (2) test the effectiveness of BMI in preventing initiation/escalation of marijuana use among youth in community health clinics. The proposed BMI prevention/interventions are innovative because: a) they incorporate tailoring technology based on assessment of the adolescents' behaviors; and b) they incorporate prevention messages for those who have not initiated use, and intervention messages for those who are current users. This randomized controlled trial will screen 1,710 adolescents in primary care clinics over 30 months. A random sample of the approximately 70% who screen negative for past year marijuana use will be selected to participate in the study (n=450); all subjects who screen positive for past year use will be enrolled in the study (n=450). These 900 subjects will be stratified by gender, age, and past year marijuana use and randomized to one of three conditions: 1) computer-delivered brief motivational approach (BMI-C) (n=300; 150 non-users: prevention, 150 users: intervention); 2) therapist-delivered brief motivational approach (BMI-T) (n=300; 150 non-users, 150 users); or 3) a NIDA drug education booklet (DPB) (n=300; 150 non-users, 150 users). Primary outcomes will be evaluated at 3-, 6- and 12-months and include marijuana, alcohol, tobacco and other drug use. Key moderators of effectiveness will be examined, including behavioral intentions, self-efficacy, stage of change, school involvement, susceptibility to peer pressure, and potential health consequences (e.g., STD/HIV risk behaviors). This project will provide the critical first step toward the implementation of tailored marijuana prevention and intervention in primary care clinics.

"Research Training in the Prevention of Drug Abuse & AIDS in Communities of Color    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised application for a MIDARP program at Howard University describes a mentoring program in drug abuse research and AIDS prevention in communities of color, which is designed to increase the capacity of faculty and students at Howard to conduct rigorous and competitive research in the prevention of drug abuse and HIV/AIDS in communities of color. The program will emphasize training in transdisciplinary research on relationships between environmental stress, biological responses, risk behaviors and health outcomes and will utilize collaborations with senior investigators in research intensive universities to mentor Howard faculty investigators. The MIDARP will also work closely with existing programs that link Howard faculty and students to research training opportunities to (1) increase knowledge and interest in drug abuse and AIDS prevention research among faculty and students in these programs and (2) utilize the resources of these programs to expand the range of training opportunities available to MIDARP investigators and students. Howard students will be introduced to drug abuse and AIDS prevention research and career development by augmenting existing drug abuse courses in the College of Arts and Sciences and the curriculum for medical, basic science, nursing, and pharmacy students to include information on drug abuse and AIDS prevention research. They will also fund a pre-doctoral dissertation stipend and recruit students to serve as research assistants in the MIDARP pilot studies. The unique strengths of the program include the opportunity to (1) integrate education regarding drug abuse and AIDS prevention research into existing research training programs for faculty and students;(2) train individuals in diverse disciplines such as the health professions and sciences (i.e., medicine, basic sciences, pharmacy, nursing) who are less likely to pursue research careers in drug abuse and AIDS prevention research; and (3) support transdisciplinary research in drug use and AIDS prevention based on strong existing university research programs in genetics, physiology, and psychobiology. A transdisciplinary approach will be reflected in the MIDARP leadership that includes a Director who is a behavioral scientist specializing in research on environmental stress, drug use, and AIDS risk in communities of color and a Deputy Director who is an immunogeneticist with expertise in microbiology, and founding Director of the Human Genome Project at Howard University.          ",Research Training in the Prevention of Drug Abuse & AIDS in Communities of Color,7496244,R24DA021470,"['Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Ally ', ' Dentistry ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Institution ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Long-Term Consequences of Exposure to Family Violence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to identify the extent to which, and the mechanisms through which, exposure to violence in the family might disrupt individual development in adolescence, with consequences that cascade over the life course and affect a subsequent generation. Exposure to family violence is conceptualized broadly to include domestic violence, child abuse, family conflict and exposure to multiple forms of violence. Key outcomes include public health targets of drug use, HIV/AIDS risk and violence. Guided by a developmental life-span model the study will employ prospective data from three generations of subjects in the Rochester Youth Development Study (RYDS). Generation 2, or G2 are the original RYDS cohort of 1000 urban adolescents followed from early adolescence to their early thirties. Their parents, G1 were also interviewed during the first 10 years of the study. Their children (G3) are followed from early childhood into adolescence. Measurement is multi-agent and multimethod, including self-report, observational and official measurement. Specific aims are (1) To describe the incidence and prevalence of types of family violence exposure in two consecutive generations of an urban, community-based sample with a substantial number of high-risk and minority males and females (2) To examine the adolescent impact of different types of violence exposure (and of multiple  exposure) on drug use, risk for HIV/AIDS and other problem behaviors, as well as pro-social competencies. (3) To examine if G2 exposure to family violence leads to drug use and other problems in emerging adulthood, either directly or indirectly via its consequences on adolescent development. (4) To examine long-term consequences of family violence exposure on consolidation of adult roles by the early 30's, especially stable work and family formation and avoidance of drug use and criminal involvement.

"Role of Race in Criminal Justice Referrals to Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The criminal justice system has become the primary source of referrals to drug treatment. Despite substantial evidence that minorities, particularly African Americans, are over-represented in the drug arrestee population, they remain a relatively small share of criminal justice referrals. It has yet to be determined if this lower representation is a function of racial and ethnic disparities in the criminal justice system or an artifact of some common case-level factors that reduce minority eligibility for treatment referral. We propose to examine the adjudication of drug offenders in California from 1982- 2005 to determine the extent to which race/ethnicity has played a role in final disposition and referral to drug treatment. California represents a unique environment in which to examine these associations because of its demographic and regional diversity, availability of detailed administrative data representing a census of individuals arrested and processed, and adoption of two important policies - drug courts and diversion - that promote treatment in lieu of incarceration. The proposed study significantly improves existing research by considering temporal and geographic patterns in disparities at each stage of the adjudication process within a single state subject to the same rule of law. It comprehensively considers the role of race/ethnicity at each stage of the adjudication process and the net effect on the final placement of minorities in treatment, and so may identify why previous studies have provided inconsistent results. Finally, by considering the impact of restorative justice policies, such as drug courts and diversion, on the processing of drug offenders by race/ethnicity, this project will assist policymakers with efforts to reduce disparities in the criminal justice and treatment system. The elimination of health disparities is an overarching goal of Healthy People 2010. The criminal justice system is critical to eliminating disparities because minorities, particularly African Americans, are substantially over-represented in this population and because the criminal justice system is the largest referral source to treatment. A careful examination of the adjudication process for drug offenders will make it possible to determine if differential access to treatment truly exists among arrestees and what factors have caused it. Further, by examining trends in adjudication practices using a large panel data set in California, this study will be able to explicitly consider whether recent policy reforms aimed at improving access to treatment particularly among minorities have indeed done so.           ",Role of Race in Criminal Justice Referrals to Treatment,7466656,R01DA022719,"['Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Environment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Placement ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adoption ', ' Guidelines ', ' court ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Justice ', ' Laws ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Noise ', ' Play ', ' Staging ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' SAMHSA ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' California ', ' adjudication ', ' adjudicative process and procedure ', ' offender ', ' criminal offender ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Censuses ', ' County ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' parole ', ' Drug Courts ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NIDA,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2008,298503,0.09882567964943394
"Collaborative Research on Drug Abuse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This P01 develops and applies state-of-the-art methods to analyze existing but under-utilized drug abuse databases in collaboration with their owners. We address contemporary, theoretical, and applied issues in drug abuse research to understand intersections between substance abuse and AIDS risk behaviors as well as minority and gender-based health disparities. We work with dozens of investigators from drug & social policy, epidemiology, health sciences, medicine, nursing, psychiatry, psychology, public health, and social work who own exciting substance abuse data to develop models that test current theories, especially on epidemiology, prevention, intervention, and treatment of drug abuse, using modern multivariate methods to control for measurement errors, biases, and other confounds. The Models and Methods Project develops psychometric and statistical analytic techniques that hold special promise for improving the quality of drug abuse and AIDS research. The At-Risk Project studies substance abuse related data sets on vulnerable populations (substance abusers, homeless people, individuals who are HIV positive or who have AIDS, victims of domestic abuse, runaways, gang members, and others at high risk for AIDS or drug abuse) with methods to control sampling, measurement, distributional and other biases. The Community Project studies drug abuse etiology, adult consequences, HIV risk, intergenerational processes, general deviance, and related issues in large community-based samples, and develops and tests explanatory theories using models that permit separation of common from specific effects, control for artifacts, etc. The Core Project oversees and integrates all components, hosts visiting scholars, provides computer facilities, and sponsors a mentoring program for disadvantaged students. The substantive part of the Models Project and the At-Risk and Community Projects will be developing and testing integrative theories that can be applied across different populations. The findings from their studies will lead to greater understanding of precursors and concomitants of substance abuse and HIV/AIDS risk and transmission. In turn, these findings will guide development of effective interventions to reduce negative health outcomes and treatment disparities in community, ethnic, and vulnerable populations, and provide guidance on how these may be alleviated.      PROGRAM CHARACTERISTICS          ",Collaborative Research on Drug Abuse,7502053,P01DA001070,[''],NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P01,2008,1065557,0.06373110537308126
"Social networks and HIV risk among rural drug users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is in response to PA-06-478, ""Research on Rural Mental Health and Drug Abuse Disorders"". One of the research areas highlighted by this PA is the examination of rural HIV transmission using social network analysis. The overall goal of the study is to examine the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors for HIV and other blood borne infections (BBIs) such as hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) among rural Appalachian drug users using social network analysis and multilevel modeling. HIV continues to be a major public health problem in the United States, especially among drug users. However, little is known about HIV in rural areas in which there are marked health disparities. Therefore, given that studies among urban drug users have found that social network indicators are robust predictors of HIV risk, both social network and individual characteristics will be measured for their association with HIV risk among rural drug users. The specific aims are: 1) To determine the prevalence and incidence of HIV, HCV and HBV among rural injection and non- injection drug users; 2) To examine HIV and other BBI risk among rural injection and non-injection drug users; and 3) To examine longitudinal changes in rural HIV, HCV and HBV risk at 6-months, 12-months and 18- months post-baseline. To meet these aims, a sample 500 rural injection and non-injection drug users will be recruited using respondent driven sampling (RDS). In addition to biologic testing for HIV, HCV and HBV, rural participants will be given an interviewer-administered questionnaire pertaining to their social networks (drug, sexual and support networks), sociodemographics, drug use, HIV risk behaviors, psychiatric diagnoses, intravention and norms. Since individuals will be nested within networks, data will be analyzed using multilevel random effects regression that allows for the simultaneous examination of social network and individual-level risk. Consistent with the priorities of the NIDA AIDS Research Program, this proposal will explore the social network structure in a rural drug using population in order to better understand how network factors may affect HIV risk in rural areas using an innovative multilevel approach. Results from the proposed study will inform the design and implementation of HIV interventions in rural areas and help to determine the appropriate population for which to target such activities in order to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV and other BBIs.       Although HIV remains a significant public health problem in the United States, especially among drug users, little is known about HIV risk in rural areas such as Appalachia. It has been shown in urban populations that relationships among drug users, also known as social networks, are important predictors of HIV risk. Therefore, this study seeks to characterize rural HIV risk by measuring both social network and individual behaviors in order to inform prevention activities in health resource-deprived rural areas.          ",Social networks and HIV risk among rural drug users,7418878,R01DA024598,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Epidemic ', ' Social Network ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Affect ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health Resources ', ' Hepatitis B ', ' serum hepatitis ', ' infection with hepatitis B virus ', ' infection with HBV ', ' Viral Hepatitis B ', ' Hepatitis B Infection ', ' Hepatitis B Virus ', ' Homologous Serum Hepatitis Virus ', ' HBV ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non-A non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non A non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis nonA nonB ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' PT-NANBH ', ' Non-B Hepatitis Parenterally-Transmitted Non-A ', ' NANBH ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Area ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Interviewer ', ' Interview ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' HCV ', ' Kentucky ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Respondent ', ' Object Attachment ', ' Psychological Bonding ', ' Object Relationship ', ' Bonding (Psychology) ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug user ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rural Population ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachia ', ' Serologic tests ', ' serology ', ' Serological Tests ', ' Individual Adjustment ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Urban Population ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Behavior ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Seroprevalences ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Disease regression ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Measures ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2008,488124,0.12666251430322556
"Clinical and Social Implications of Cost Sharing for Cancer Drugs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Yu-Ning Wong, a Medical Oncologist at Fox Chase Cancer Center is dedicated to a career in cancer health services research. Her goal is to develop a multidisciplinary research program to understand the impact of insurance design on cancer drug utilization and clinical outcomes. This Career Development Award will provide the means to take two important steps towards accomplishing this goal. First, it will allow for additional intensive mentored education and training in public policy research, health economics, and advanced statistical methods that will augment the candidate's previous rigorous training in epidemiology, biostatistics, and clinical medicine. Second, it will support the development of an original clinical research program using rigorous epidemiologic, econometric and survey methods to examine the impact of prescription drug insurance coverage on cancer outcomes. As new costly cancer drugs are introduced, patients with both public and private insurance are facing higher out- of-pocket costs. Cost sharing between insurers and patients (though co-payments and deductibles) has been traditionally used to control costs based on an expectation that unnecessary health care utilization will be reduced. However this expectation may result in worse socioeconomic disparities in care since some patients may be unable to afford highly effective cancer treatments. The candidate proposes three complementary studies to address the important, unanswered questions about the impact of cost sharing on cancer outcomes. Project A is a conjoint analysis-based survey to measure how patients make decisions among treatments of varying efficacy, toxicity and cost. Project B uses the results from Project A in a decision analysis model to measure the sensitivity of clinical outcomes to price and patient preferences. This will also allow us to determine if is possible to improve clinical outcomes by using low cost sharing to increase adherence to high value treatments. Project C is a natural experiment using insurance claims to measure the effect of insurance design and sociodemographic factors on the receipt of a new, expensive anti-nausea medication and subsequent outcomes. This research program will triangulate on the nexus of issues central to the understanding of cost sharing on cancer drug utilization and clinical outcomes and form the foundation for the candidate's transition to an independent investigator in cancer health services research. This project will have broad implications for the financing of high cost medical interventions because it will help policy makers, insurers and physicians understand how current models of cost sharing may contribute to socioeconomic disparities in cancer care. Our results may suggest consideration of a novel benefit design that encourages patients to make decisions based on relative value, rather than cost alone.           ",Clinical and Social Implications of Cost Sharing for Cancer Drugs,7572061,K07CA136995,"['Cost Control ', ' Cost Containment ', ' Cost Measures ', ' Decision Analysis ', ' Decision Analyses ', ' Decision Making ', ' Deductibles ', ' aprepitant ', ' Diffusion ', ' Drug Utilization ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Policy Research ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Fox Chase Cancer Center ', ' Observational Study ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' prescription document ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adoption ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Training ', ' Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' total medical expenditure ', ' medical expenses not covered by insurance ', ' Uninsured Medical Fees (not covered) ', ' Uncovered Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' Uncovered Medical Expenses ', ' Out-of-Pocket Expense ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Nausea ', ' Medical Oncologist ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Antiemetics ', ' Antiemetic Drugs ', ' Antiemetic Agents ', ' Anti-emetics ', ' prescription procedure ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Probability ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' anticancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Public Policy ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' United States ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Training and Education ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' payment ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Underinsured ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' chemotherapy ', ' Nexus (resin cement) ', ' ']",NCI,FOX CHASE CANCER CENTER,K07,2008,143378,0.027485458307407232
"The Center for the Study and Prevention of Drug Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This proposal for the Center for Study and Prevention of Drug Use is submitted by Morgan State University and seeks funding under the PAR-02-016 mechanism in response to the PA entitled ""Minority Institutions' Drug Abuse Research Development Program"" (MIDARP). The proposed Center will be an inter-institutional collaborative effort involving Morgan State University, a minority institution, and research intensive universities and programmatic initiatives that focus on and specialize in research on drug use and disparities associated with drug use. The Center seeks to build on the collaborative relationships established through the Center to increase the capacity of Morgan State, its faculty and its students to conduct rigorous drug use research with and emphasis on drug use epidemiology, public health, and health disparities related to drug use. In order to actualize the mission of the Center, four components were developed which address the necessary aspects of creating a drug use research center. 1) The Faculty Development Plan, which seeks to advance Morgan faculty by allowing them to engage in off-site collaborative research with individuals specializing in drug research. 2) A second aspect is the Student Development Plan, which seeks to expose, educate and, train minority students in the area of drug use research. 3) The research arm of the project includes a primary and four developmental pilot project, allowing researchers at Morgan to begin using their present expertise and investigating topics in the area of drug use and disparities related to drug use. 4) Overseeing, each of the areas is the proposed plan for the Administrative Units and Center Organization. Through this component collaborative relationships, research projects, and faculty and student development will be monitored and enhanced. As a result of the Center faculty at Morgan State will be further enhanced regarding their ability to conduct rigorous research independently, specifically submitting R01's.

"Drugs, sexual impulsivity, HIV: Psychosocial and cognitive risk factors of YMSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unprotected sexual intercourse between men constitutes 58% of all reported cases of AIDS and 80% of HIV cases 1,2. Rates of HIV infection among 15 to 24 year olds continue to increase with MSM behavior remaining the leading cause of HIV infection among adolescent males 1,2. Over 90% of YMSM have reported having more than one sexual partner in the past 6 months and between 33% and 49% have had unprotected anal intercourse during the same time3. Studies show that use of stimulants, particularly methamphetamine, may influence risky sexual practices and contribute to the most recent wave of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)4-6. Systematic development of theory has been identified as a crucial step in efficacious intervention development, but previous conceptual models have focused on a relatively limited array of explanatory constructs. However, Social Action Theory (SAT)7 provides a promising model for examining the risk behavior of YMSM, because it includes individual as well as social and contextual determinants. SAT remains to be tested for use in the field of HIV and with YMSM, because this model was originally conceived as a general health promotion model for the adult population. Using data from the Dr. Kipke's NIDA funded ""Healthy Young Men Study"" (HYM), this study will conduct multivariate analysis to test this model for use with the YMSM population. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) To empirically validate the chain of relationships depicted in Social Action Theory to determine if the theory addresses the interaction of individual, contextual, and social correlates of sexual and drug risk taking behaviors as they relate to YMSM; and 2) To further validate SAT by testing and incorporating competing theoretical relationships depicted in other behavioral theory models to develop a comprehensive theory of the social, psychosocial and cognitive risk factors for drug use, sexual impulsivity, and HIV among YMSM to guide prevention intervention efforts. . This study will contribute to the objectives of the AIDS-Science Track Award for Research Transition by 1) supporting a New Researcher; 2) addressing the NIDA research objective in the area of HIV, drug abuse, impulsivity, and coping strategies of an at-risk, under represented population; and 3) through refinement of a comprehensive theoretical model, we will provide a platform for developing interventions that address risk behavior related to HIV transmission among YMSM.

"Spatial Variations in IDU HIV Risk: Relationship to Structural Interventions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The likelihood that illicit drug users will engage in drug-related HIV risk behaviors or suffer adverse drug-related health outcomes varies considerably across neighborhoods. While an emerging line of research has investigated whether particular neighborhood-level characteristics (e.g., presence of dilapidated housing and social disorder) determines neighborhood-level variation in these drug-related behaviors and health outcomes, no research has yet studied whether syringe access (SA) programs or drug-related criminal justice (D-RCJ) activities contribute to neighborhood-level variations in drug-related behaviors and health outcomes among illicit drug users, including injection drug users (IDUs). This absence is striking: (1) SA programs and D-RCJ activities affect patterns of drug-related health behaviors, outcomes, and service use; (2) SA programs and D- RCJ activities are place-based, structural interventions: they are unevenly distributed across neighborhoods and shape the local context in which IDUs use drugs; and (3) D-RCJ activities (and possibly SA programs) exert different impacts on drug-related HIV risk behaviors and health service use among IDUs of different racial/ethnic groups. Explaining racial/ethnic variations in drug-related HIV risk and health service use is a NIDA priority. Current measures of SA programs and D-RCJ activities, however, preclude studying whether these interventions shape geographic variation in drug-related HIV risk behaviors, health outcomes and service use among IDUs. The proposed exploratory study will achieve 3 aims by analyzing existing data: to (1a) Construct new measures of SA programs and D-RCJ activities as place-based, structural, and multidimensional interventions; and (1b) Apply these measures to describe variations in SA programs and D- RCJ activities over time (1995-2006) across NYC's 42 health districts. By applying spatial analysis methods we will calculate, for each NYC health district and year, spatial access to syringes and to SA programs (overall and by program type); and intensity of drug-related arrest, incarceration, and police surveillance. (2) Use multilevel methods to explore whether variations in these measures across health districts and time are related to variations among IDUs in drug-related HIV risk behaviors and health service use across districts and time. (3) Explore if variations in these district-level measures create variations in drug-related HIV risk behaviors and service use, both within and between racial/ethnic groups of IDUs. The proposed project will lay the foundations for future investigations of the ways that SA programs and D-RCJ activities shape neighborhood- level variations in a wide range of health behaviors (e.g., HIV sexual risk), outcomes (e.g., HIV transmission), and service use (e.g., drug treatment entry) among IDU populations in multiple cities. Research based on these measures may provide important insight into how to modify SA programs and D-RCJ activities so as to reduce morbidity and mortality among drug users, their sex partners, and neighbors. Public Health Relevance Statement Rates of drug-related HIV risk behaviors and adverse drug-related health outcomes vary across neighborhoods in a city. No research has yet explored whether syringe access (SA) programs or drug-related criminal justice (D-RCJ) activities affect this neighborhood-level variation. The proposed project will construct measures of SA programs and D-RCJ activities that will allow us to explore whether these programs and activities create neighborhood-level variation in key drug-related health behaviors, outcomes, and service use in a city, and will empirically test whether changes in SA programs and D-RCJ activities in one US city (NYC) are associated with (1) neighborhood-level variation in drug injectors' drug-related HIV risk behaviors and health service use and (2) racial/ethnic variations in these outcomes. Project-created measures of SA programs and D-RCJ activities can be applied to other cities, and can be used to analyze neighborhood-level variations in a wide range of health behaviors, outcomes, and service use among injectors (e.g., sexual risk behaviors, HIV or HCV transmission, drug treatment entry). Research based on these measures may provide important insight into how to modify SA programs and D-RCJ activities so as to reduce morbidity and mortality among drug users, their sex partners, and neighbors. Given concerns that SA programs adversely affect local quality of life, project measures can also be used to empirically test the relationship between SA program presence in a neighborhood and local crime rates and other adverse social outcomes.          ",Spatial Variations in IDU HIV Risk: Relationship to Structural Interventions,7493043,R21DA023391,"['Crime ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' geographic difference ', ' geographic variation ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Legal ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Range ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Housing ', ' Area ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' insight ', ' Linear Models ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Legal Status ', ' Inequality ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Needle-Exchange Programs ', ' needle exchange ', ' Syringe-Exchange Programs ', ' Funding ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxication ', ' detoxification ', ' Metabolism of Toxic Agents ', ' Metabolic Drug Detoxications ', ' Drug Metabolic Detoxification ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' National Research Council (U.S.) ', ' National Research Council ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Shapes ', ' Drug user ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Condition ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rosa ', ' Rose ', ' Sales ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Syringes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Behavior ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' Services ', ' Participant ', ' Modality ', ' social ', ' Medical Surveillance ', ' Epidemiology / Surveillance ', ' Measures ', ' Needle Sharing ', ' Syringe Sharing ', ' Needlesharing ', ' Police ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' Latino ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Hepatitis C Transmission ', ' hepatitis C virus transmission ', ' HCV Transmission ', ' Outcome ', ' drug distribution ', ' Population ', ' administrative database ', ' administrative data base ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' ']",NIDA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,177295,0.05989522887805168
"Targeting HIV Risk Behaviors in Juvenile Drug Court-Involved Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overriding purpose of this study is to develop and test an intervention for reducing substance use and risky sexual behaviors among youth involved in juvenile drug court. Juvenile drug court provides an excellent setting in which to pursue the key study objectives by providing access to a well identified high risk population. Second, in addition to frequent judicial oversight, juvenile drug courts include several features that can enhance intervention effectiveness, sustainability, and potential for adoption. In addition, the fact that all juvenile drug courts have community-based treatment components and that such courts have been disseminated nationwide suggests the possibility of eventual widespread adoption if the proposed intervention is effective. The proposed intervention integrates evidence-based protocols for contingency management (CM) for substance abusing youth and family engagement strategies, with an evidence-informed family systems intervention for sexual risk originally developed to address substance use and sexual risk behaviors in HIV+ youth. These three interventions will be integrated into an efficient intervention that, if effective, can be amenable to adoption by juvenile drug courts. Following protocol development and beta testing, 160 drug court youth and their families will be randomized to the experimental intervention condition (HIV Risk Reduction or ""HRR"") versus Drug Court with Community Services (DC) conditions. Key outcomes will be assessed through 12-months post-baseline using a multi-method approach that will include assessment of substance use, risky sexual behaviors, criminal behavior, and participation in HIV counseling and testing services. Specific aims include: 1: Adapt existing intervention and training protocols into a single, efficient HRR intervention, beta test this HHR protocol with four youth in juvenile drug court and their families, and revise treatment and research protocols accordingly; 2: Conduct a randomized trial with 160 youth in juvenile drug court and their families to examine youth-level intervention effects (i.e., on substance use, sexual risk behavior, HIV counseling and testing, delinquent behavior) in comparison to DC through 12- months post referral and assess intervention fidelity. 3. If results suggest a positive HRR treatment effect, revise the intervention and training protocols in preparation for an effectiveness study and extended follow-up study. Importantly, the proposed study will (1) consider the multiple levels of influence on juvenile drug use, criminal justice involvement, and HIV risk behaviors, (2) integrate a drug abuse and HIV prevention intervention for youth in the criminal justice system with drug-related offenses, (3) address health disparities by targeting a primarily minority population of youth, and (4) increase referrals to HIV testing and counseling of drug court-involved youth. This study is designed to reduce HIV risk by addressing the potent interaction of drug use and risky sexual behaviors in drug court youth with evidence-based treatment components to maximize the likelihood of reversing these youths' adverse behavioral trajectories.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study is designed to gain knowledge about effective interventions for reducing HIV risk in a high risk population. Reducing HIV risk by effectively targeting substance use and risky sexual behaviors and by locating even a small number of HIV-positive youth could favorably impact society at multiple levels (individual, family, peer, community, fiscal).           PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is designed to gain knowledge about effective interventions for reducing HIV risk in a high risk population.

"Community Vulnerability and Responses to IDU-Related HIV  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this competing continuation, we will conduct a longitudinal study (1993-2007) of 96 large metropolitan areas to study trends and predictors of changes in the population prevalence of drug injectors, HIV) prevalence among injectors, and related prevention programs. In stage one of this project, we developed ways to estimate the population density of injection drug use and HIV prevalence rates in metropolitan areas. We showed that per capita injection drug use increased during the 1990s in many localities, including Baltimore and Salt Lake City. HIV prevalence rates among drug injectors increased in Baltimore and some other areas. In many metropolitan areas, drug injection and HIV rates among injectors declined. The extent to which local HIV prevention programs reached drug injectors also varied widely: 3 metropolitan areas provided treatment to 20% or more of their injectors, while 13 areas reached less than 5%. HIV counseling and testing rates also varied widely. In cross-sectional analyses, we showed that local government budgetary decisions, social and economic factors, and drug abuse interventions were related to injection drug users per capita, HIV revalence among drug injectors, and the presence and size of various programs to prevent HIV among drug injectors. We will build upon our existing data and construct a database for these 96 metropolitan areas containing annual estimates from 1993 - 2007 of drug injectors per capita; HIV prevalence, incident AIDS cases and AIDS mortality among drug injectors; program availability and size; socioeconomic conditions, and government budgetary allocations. We will (1) describe patterns of change over time in prevention programs and epidemiology. We will use longitudinal analysis methods to study (2) how changing socioeconomic conditions, epidemiologic need, budgetary constraints and choices, and policy choices are related to subsequent HIV prevention programming; and (3) how all these variables are related to later changes in (a) drug injectors per capita, (b) HIV prevalence and AIDS among drug injectors, (c) drug abuse treatment and other programs for drug injectors, and (d) racial/ethnic disparities in appropriate indicators. We will use these analyses to develop a well-theorized scientific understanding of forces that shape metropolitan area HIV/AIDS epidemics, rates of drug injectors per capita, and prevention programs. The resulting scientific knowledge base can help develop programs and policies so as to avoid epidemics and, if needed, control them.

"Barriers to Treatment-based HIV Prevention for IDU Couples    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite recent advances in HIV prevention, injecting drug users (IDUs) in the U.S. still account for 1/3 of new infections. Racial/ethnic disparities in injection drug use also continue to cause a disproportionate share of new HIV cases among minorities and women. This proposal targets a vulnerable and understudied population of IDUs - minority, heterosexual, IDU couples (i.e. partnered IDUs). While research on partnered IDUs is scarce, existing literature indicates that partnered IDUs are at high risk for HIV from both drug- related and sexual risk behaviors. Partnered IDUs, especially partnered women IDUs, also have limited success in reducing drug use, accessing or completing drug abuse treatment, and maintaining treatment outcomes (reduced drug use, safer drug-use practices, safer sex). This profile of partnered IDUs has important implications for treatment-based HIV prevention. Drug abuse treatment is an effective method for reducing drug-and sex-related HIV risk among IDUs. A recent NIDA publication concludes that ""drug abuse treatment is HIV prevention."" However, the median proportion of IDUs who access treatment in the U.S. is extremely low - less than 9%. Clearly, the full efficacy of HIV prevention cannot be realized unless more IDUs enter treatment. Since a substantial number of IDUs are sexually partnered with other IDUs (more than 40%, according to out own NYC data), understanding and overcoming barriers to successful treatment and treatment-based HIV prevention among partnered IDUs will have a substantial impact on reducing drug use and HIV risk, especially among minority women. This qualitative study of IDU couples and treatment providers focuses on two sets of barriers to drug treatment and treatment-based HIV risk reduction among African American and Latino heterosexual IDU couples in NYC: (1) relationship dynamics among partnered IDUs that deter treatment entry, retention or the maintenance of outcomes; and (2) couples-specific structural barriers in the treatment system that further inhibit treatment entry, retention, and the maintenance of outcomes. We are also interested in (3) how these two kinds of barriers interact. Findings from the proposed research will inform subsequent work to quantify these barriers and develop and evaluate programs to overcome them. This study is proposed by a new investigator and utilizes the R-21 mechanism. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT HIV transmission among injection drug users (IDUs) continues to be an important public health issue. Despite recent advances in HIV prevention, injection drug users in the U.S. still account for 1/3 of all new infections. Racial/ethnic disparities in injection drug use also continue to cause a disproportionate share of infections. The proposed study primarily targets African American and Latino IDUs who are partnered in intimate relationships. While research on partnered IDUs is scarce, existing literature indicates that they are at high risk for HIV from both drug-related and sexual risk behaviors. In addition, they have limited success in reducing drug use, accessing or completing drug abuse treatment and maintaining treatment outcomes (reduced drug use, safer drug use practices, safer sex). The proposed study will contribute to an understanding of interpersonal and structural barriers to drug treatment and treatment-mediated HIV prevention and lead to recommendations for needed improvements.          ",Barriers to Treatment-based HIV Prevention for IDU Couples,7487442,R21DA022960,"['Couples ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' base ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Infection ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Numbers ', ' Literature ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Risk Reduction Behavior ', ' Lifestyle Risk Reduction ', ' Maintenance ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Shapes ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Attitude ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' interest ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' metropolitan ', ' condoms ', ' Reporting ', ' Needle Sharing ', ' Syringe Sharing ', ' Needlesharing ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Personal Communication ', ' Interpersonal Communication ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Accounting ', ' Minority ', ' protective behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' safer sex ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NIDA,"NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH INSTITUTES, INC.",R21,2008,178973,0.2080351955797551
"Gender Differences in Healthcare and Drug Treatment Utilization among Drug Users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the course of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, women (particularly African-American and Hispanic women) have been increasingly affected. Women now account for 1 in every 3 newly reported cases of HIV infection in the U.S., with two major modes of transmission: heterosexual contact and injection drug use. Research has documented a gender disparity in health care and drug treatment utilization. For example, compared with men, drug-using women receive less medical and psychiatric services, although they have poorer physical and mental health. Drug-using women also have lower retention and treatment completion rates than men in substance abuse treatment. In addition, drug-using women with HIV are less likely than men to receive HIV medication and to adhere to HAART. The factors contributing to these gender differences in minority communities are not fully understood and deserve elucidation through research. The proposed study, using existing dual-site longitudinal data, will examine factors related to gender differences in health care and drug use treatment utilization among Puerto Rican IDUs and crack smokers, a group at high risk for HIV. The two sites studied (New York and Puerto Rico) will provide a comparison of gender disparities in health care, for the same ethnic group in two communities with different resource contexts. The specific aims of the proposed study are: 1) To examine, by gender, factors associated with health care utilization among Puerto Rican drug users in NY and PR; 2) to identify (a) factors mediating the relationship between gender and health care utilization, and (b) interaction effects with gender in the relationships with health care utilization; 3) to examine, by gender, factors associated with drug treatment utilization; 4) to identify (a) factors mediating the relationship between gender and drug treatment utilization, and (b) interaction effects with gender in the relationships with drug treatment utilization; and 5) to assess how the relationships above (#1 - #4) vary between two different health resource environments. In addition, the study will assess whether predictors of HIV medication use differ between women and men over time. The major statistical analyses used will be: multiple logistic regression and hierarchical linear modeling (for longitudinal analysis). Findings will be useful in developing gender-specific interventions to improve health care and drug treatment utilization in women. Gender disparities in health care (including drug treatment) utilization are important public health issues. In particular, among minority drug-using populations, women, as compared to men, receive less medical and psychiatric services, although they experience poorer physical and mental health. However, the factors contributing to these gender differences in minority communities remain under-studied. The proposed study will contribute to an understanding of gender-differentiated healthcare behaviors, and further lead to recommendations to narrow the gender gap.             ",Gender Differences

"Service Use, ATI Program Outcomes, and Pro-Social Change This application details a proposal for a prospective longitudinal panel study with a random sample of 360 individuals attending alternative to incarceration (ATI) programs in New York City (NYC) that serve drug- involved offenders. The proposed study focuses on (1) the impact of utilization of formal healthcare and psychosocial services on outcomes of ATI program completion, recidivism, technical violations (i.e., law- breaking behaviors not resulting in re-incarceration), and pro-social change (e.g., fulfilling child- and elder- caretaking roles); and (2) factors affecting service utilization among ATI program participants. The study fulfills several recommendations from the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Health Service Research at NIDA, including broadening both (a) the venues of drug abuse services researchto include programs in ""nontraditional"" settings, especially the criminal justice system, and (b) the range of needs and characteristics of subgroups that are studied in order to address a fuller ""continuum of care and patient groups."" The Task Force's recommendations echoed other calls regarding the need to elucidate mediators of success of treatment, especially those in nontraditional settings such as criminal justice programs for drug-involved offenders.Also consistent with the Task Force report, the proposed research will employ new data analysis methods for causal inference using observational data. The significance and feasibility of the proposed study are substantiated by findings from a pilot study successfully completed by the investigators. For the proposed study, we will recruit individuals at the start of their participation in ATI programs designed for adult, drug-involved offenders in NYC, conducting structured interviews every 3 months over the course of 18 months for each participant. Aims, hypotheses, and measurements are guided by the Network Episode Model, an innovative model that conceptualizes access and attendance of formal services as a time-varying behavior driven by level of need and shaped by dynamic processes involving individual/social context factors and service system experiences. The proposed study is designed to achieve the following primary aims: (1) To examine the causal relationship between service utilization and (a) ATI program completion, (b) recidivism, (c) technical violations, and (d) pro-social change; and (2) To identify and estimate the causal impact of factors that influence access and utilization of formal services among ATI participants. Findings will generate substantive and practical implications for researchers and professionals in the areas of drug abuse, services research, criminal justice, and public health in developing and testing future interventions and programs for drug-involved offenders. The proposed study will be conducted by Dr. Elwin Wu and Dr. Nabila EI-Bassel of the Social Intervention Group at the Columbia University School of Social Work.

"Clinical and Social Implications of Cost Sharing for Cancer Drugs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Yu-Ning Wong, a Medical Oncologist at Fox Chase Cancer Center is dedicated to a career in cancer health services research. Her goal is to develop a multidisciplinary research program to understand the impact of insurance design on cancer drug utilization and clinical outcomes. This Career Development Award will provide the means to take two important steps towards accomplishing this goal. First, it will allow for additional intensive mentored education and training in public policy research, health economics, and advanced statistical methods that will augment the candidate's previous rigorous training in epidemiology, biostatistics, and clinical medicine. Second, it will support the development of an original clinical research program using rigorous epidemiologic, econometric and survey methods to examine the impact of prescription drug insurance coverage on cancer outcomes. As new costly cancer drugs are introduced, patients with both public and private insurance are facing higher out- of-pocket costs. Cost sharing between insurers and patients (though co-payments and deductibles) has been traditionally used to control costs based on an expectation that unnecessary health care utilization will be reduced. However this expectation may result in worse socioeconomic disparities in care since some patients may be unable to afford highly effective cancer treatments. The candidate proposes three complementary studies to address the important, unanswered questions about the impact of cost sharing on cancer outcomes. Project A is a conjoint analysis-based survey to measure how patients make decisions among treatments of varying efficacy, toxicity and cost. Project B uses the results from Project A in a decision analysis model to measure the sensitivity of clinical outcomes to price and patient preferences. This will also allow us to determine if is possible to improve clinical outcomes by using low cost sharing to increase adherence to high value treatments. Project C is a natural experiment using insurance claims to measure the effect of insurance design and sociodemographic factors on the receipt of a new, expensive anti-nausea medication and subsequent outcomes. This research program will triangulate on the nexus of issues central to the understanding of cost sharing on cancer drug utilization and clinical outcomes and form the foundation for the candidate's transition to an independent investigator in cancer health services research. This project will have broad implications for the financing of high cost medical interventions because it will help policy makers, insurers and physicians understand how current models of cost sharing may contribute to socioeconomic disparities in cancer care. Our results may suggest consideration of a novel benefit design that encourages patients to make decisions based on relative value, rather than cost alone.           ",Clinical and Social Implications of Cost Sharing for Cancer Drugs,7694277,K07CA136995,"['Cost Control ', ' Cost Containment ', ' Decision Analysis ', ' Decision Analyses ', ' Decision Making ', ' Deductibles ', ' aprepitant ', ' Diffusion ', ' Drug Utilization ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Policy Research ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Fox Chase Cancer Center ', ' Observational Study ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adoption ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Training ', ' Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' total medical expenditure ', ' medical expenses not covered by insurance ', ' Uninsured Medical Fees (not covered) ', ' Uncovered Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' Uncovered Medical Expenses ', ' Out-of-Pocket Expense ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Nausea ', ' Medical Oncologist ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Antiemetics ', ' Antiemetic Drugs ', ' Antiemetic Agents ', ' Anti-emetics ', ' Probability ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' anticancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Public Policy ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' United States ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Training and Education ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' payment ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' Drug Insurance ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Underinsured ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' chemotherapy ', ' social implication ', ' ']",NCI,FOX CHASE CANCER CENTER,K07,2009,143359,0.027485458307407232
"Familias Unidas Stage III Study: Preventing Substance Abuse in Hispanic Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study's overarching goal is to reduce the ethnic disparities in illicit drug use, cigarette use, and HIV between Hispanic and non-Hispanic youth. This goal will be accomplished by four aims: AIM 1 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Practice (i.e., standard prevention services), in preventing illicit drug use; AIM 2 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Control, in preventing cigarette use; AIM 3 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Control, in preventing unprotected sexual behavior; and AIM 4 is to assess the extent to which family functioning mediates the effects of the intervention on illicit drug use, cigarette use, and unprotected sexual behavior. Twenty four middle schools with a total sample of 744 Hispanic adolescents from a wide geographic area of Miami-Dade County will be randomized using a block design to one of two conditions: Familias Unidas or Community Practice. The Familias Unidas intervention has been evaluated and found to be efficacious in two separate randomized controlled trials. In the first study (Pantin et al., 2003), Familias Unidas was shown to be efficacious relative to a no intervention control condition in increasing family functioning and reducing behavior problems (Prado et al., 2006), risk factors for youth illicit drug use and unprotected sex. In the second randomized controlled trial (Prado et al., in press), Familias Unidas was found to be efficacious, relative to two attention control conditions, in preventing cigarette use and illicit drug use. Familias Unidas was also found to be efficacious relative to both of the control conditions in preventing/reducing unprotected sexual behavior at last sexual intercourse. Finally, family functioning was found to mediate the effects of intervention condition on the outcomes. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) will be used to test: (H1) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing illicit drug use over time; (H2) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing cigarette use over time; and (H3) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing unprotected sexual behavior over time. Additionally HLM will be used to determine whether (H1a) the effect of Familias Unidas on illicit drug use will be partially mediated by family functioning; (H2a) the effect of Familias Unidas on cigarette use will be partially mediated by family functioning and (H3a) the effect of Familias Unidas on unprotected sexual behavior will be partially mediated by family functioning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of the proposed study is to reduce illicit drug use, cigarette use, and unsafe sexual behavior health disparities in Hispanic populations. The knowledge expected to be gained from this study will aid in the development of effective interventions to reduce drug use, cigarette use, unprotected sexual behavior, and HIV in Hispanic adolescents.

"Community Vulnerability and Responses to Drug-User-Related HIV/AIDS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing continuation application for the Community Vulnerability and Responses to Drug-User- Related HIV/AIDS study of why large US metropolitan areas vary over time in their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS among drug users and in their responses-i.e., in policies and programs that may affect the epidemic. Drug use and HIV epidemics change over time. In the last funding period, we showed that HIV prevalence in the 96 largest US metropolitan areas declined among injection drug users (IDUs) from 1992 to 2002, and that the population prevalence of IDUs declined in these areas from 1992 to 2000, but then began to rise again. We also showed that metropolitan areas varied in these trajectories, and that a variety of social and policy forces shaped IDU prevalence, racial disparities in IDU prevalence, HIV prevalence among IDUs, racial disparities in AIDS prevalence among IDUs, drug abuse treatment coverage, and syringe exchange access and coverage. Ominously, our recent analyses indicate that the prevalence of IDUs among youth (aged 15 - 29) has begun to rise. Further, as others have shown, HIV has spread widely among NIDUs (non-injecting users of heroin, cocaine, crack, amphetamines or methamphetamine) in some metropolitan areas. These changes are occurring against the backdrop of an economy that has recently shifted from slow to rapid decline, a shift that will lead to great difficulty in maintaining, let alone expanding, services for drug users. Therefore, the Specific Aims of this proposed continuation are: 1. To describe trends, in the 96 largest US metropolitan areas from 1992 - 2012, in (a) critical epidemiologic outcomes (population prevalence of IDUs and NIDUs, and particularly their prevalence among youth; and, among IDUs, HIV prevalence, late-diagnosis HIV cases, and AIDS incidence and mortality) as well as in (b) the implementation of evidence-based drug- related interventions (drug abuse treatment, syringe exchange, HIV counseling and testing) and (c) non- evidence-based drug-related interventions (incarceration and arrests of drug users). 2. To understand how macro-social contexts (e.g., economic changes, social integration, racial residential segregation) and epidemiologic need affect interventions; how interventions and macro-social contexts together affect epidemiologic contexts; how some interventions (e.g., arrests, incarceration) affect others (e.g., syringe exchange coverage); and how some epidemiologic outcomes (e.g., prevalence of young IDUs) affect others (e.g., HIV prevalence). 3. To develop an integrated theory, using agent based modeling, of how these processes interact and thus what the impacts of various intervention mixes are likely to be in given social contexts. 4. To disseminate estimates, results and theoretical understandings to public health agencies and continue to advise them on how they might respond.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will estimate changes in injection and non-injection drug use, in HIV, AIDS and AIDS mortality rates among injection drug users, and in drug- and HIV-related interventions among drug users, in 96 large metropolitan areas over a 21-year period (1992 - 2012). We will investigate how these epidemics and interventions affect one another, and how macro-contextual factors like economic and social conditions shape them both. We will identify metropolitan areas in which serious drug use, HIV or AIDS epidemics are emerging, and offer state and local health departments and drug agencies the best information available on policies and programs that might reduce these epidemics. Our findings will also help national public health agencies, including the CDC and SAMHSA, and other researchers, plan a mixture of evidence-based programs and policies to reduce the forces that lead to high-risk drug use and the associated HIV and AIDS epidemics.           Public Health Relevance Statement This project will estimate changes in injection and non-injection drug use, in HIV, AIDS and AIDS mortality rates among injection drug users, and in drug- and HIV-related interventions among drug users, in 96 large metropolitan areas over a 21-year period (1992 - 2012).

"National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse (NHSN) Annual Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R13 meetings grant application seeks support for five yearly three-day stand alone conferences to be held at selected locations beginning in the fall of 2009. This proposal reflects a collaborative initiative between Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center and the National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse (NHSN), based at the University of Miami. The annual scientific conferences help to accomplish the NHSN mission of fostering both interdisciplinary and translational research, by promoting dialogue between biologic, social, behavioral, and cultural scientists and disseminating findings back to the field. Previous conferences, supported through a NIDA-funded contract, have been an effective platform for developing the aims of the NHSN, with particular emphasis on mentoring and training Hispanic graduate students and early career scientists. The aims of the conferences will be: A) to advance science in the area of drug abuse research and its co-morbid conditions, particularly as it impacts on the Hispanic population. It will promote bidirectional translational research ranging from bench to community and a trans-disciplinary cross-fertilization of ideas among scientists from all fields of drug abuse helping to establish future research priorities. B) To foster the development of Hispanic researchers, with emphasis in areas related to drug abuse research by facilitating the development of integrated and continuous collaborative and mentoring networks. Funding is requested to support participation for 50 trainees/early career scientists and 20 research scientists presenting in the scientific panels. An average of 150 participants, representing the field from the national and international scientific communities, are expected at each yearly conference, including members of the global research community whose interests encompass a multifaceted approach to understanding the factors underlying health disparities as they pertain to drug use and abuse ranging from epidemiology to environmental health, psychology, sociology, health policy, neuroscience and other biomedical sciences, and epigenetics. The first conference proposed ""Integrating Population, Laboratory, and Clinical Sciences in Minority Health"" will be hosted by the University of Miami, from December 1-3, 2009. The format of the conference aims to provide ample opportunity for discussion, networking, and collaboration discussions as well as development of new ideas related to training and mentoring of the next generation of researchers in the field of drug abuse. The themes, scientific content, and program for each conference will be developed by a Scientific Conference committee comprised of NHSN members, NIH officials, and federal liaisons. The themes will be directly related to NIDA's strategic plan and the NIH blueprint, addressing timely topics and developing challenges in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Annual National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse Conference provides multidisciplinary scientists in drug abuse and related fields interested in advancing science, particularly as it pertains to the Hispanic population, to have a collegial exchange providing a forum for discussion and dissemination of research findings and an opportunity for networking and mentoring trainees in the area of drug abuse research.

"PRESCRIBING PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS TO YOUTH: CULTURAL FACTORS IN PARENTAL ATTITUDES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes the first study to examine whether culturally related constructs explain ethnic and racial differences in parents' willingness to prescribe psychotropic drugs to youth. Despite 20 years of increasing prescriptions to minors, Black and Latino children remain half as likely as White children to receive medication. Socio-demographic and clinical variables do not account for the difference, which parallels findings of greater Black and Latino skepticism toward psychotropic medication. ""Cultural factors"" are said to explain the difference, but they have rarely been theorized or measured directly in large non-clinical and clinical samples of parents. Familism, traditionalism, fatalism, religiosity, beliefs about causes of youth disorders, perceived psychiatric medication treatment of youth stigma, acceptability of corporal punishment, and acceptability of psychotropic medication may be such factors. If so, then they should mediate the relationship between ethnicity/race and willingness to prescribe. The study will test this assumption using attitudinal and socio-demographic data collected during telephone interviews in English and Spanish with 1224 Black, Latino, and White parents or guardians of 5-17-year-old children, drawn by random-digit dialing from one ethnically diverse South Florida county. The sample will be stratified by ethnicity and race, with each of three equal-sized strata (n=408) further equally stratified by presence (n=204) or absence (n=204) in household of children with emotional or behavior problems, enabling adequate group comparisons to test - both in a general population sample of parents and in a sample of parents whose children might be referred for mental health treatment evaluation - the mediating role of culturally related constructs within a structural equation model. Potentially moderating influences of gender and SES on the model will also be tested. By increasing our ability to interpret ethnic and racial group differences more accurately, we may improve the cultural competence and fit of preventive and clinical interventions aimed at culturally diverse families. Moreover, given an uncertain benefit-to-risk ratio of psychotropic prescriptions to youth, it remains undetermined whether at a population level ethnic and racial differences should be understood as a health disparity favoring the majority because of White youths' greater exposure to drugs' benefits, or, conversely, as a public health advantage for minority youths because of their lesser exposure to drugs' risks. This study takes a logical first step toward exploring culturally embedded reasons for the majority's enthusiasm as well as for minorities' skepticism. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is the first research to date that directly addresses various potential cultural factors that may mediate, in parents, the decision to have psychotropic drugs prescribed to their children. Authors have often suggested that cultural factors play a role in producing observed differences in prescription rates among ethnic and racial groups, but no model so far has specified these possible factors and their relationships. If cultural factors impact psychotropic drug prescription practices with youth, this study will be help to understand these factors more accurately, which could lead to improved outreach, educational, and clinical interventions for families and youths with mental health problems.          ",PRESCRIBING PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS TO YOUTH: CULTURAL FACTORS IN PARENTAL ATTITUDES,7685527,R21MH084832,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Florida ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' improved ', ' Household ', ' Clinical ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Medical ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Evaluation ', ' Distress ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Minor ', ' Respondent ', ' Odds Ratio ', ' Risk Ratio ', ' Relative Odds ', ' Cross-Product Ratio ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Exposure to ', ' Psychotropic Drugs ', ' Psychopharmaceuticals ', ' Psychoactive Drugs ', ' Psychoactive Compound ', ' Psychoactive Agents ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Punishment ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stigmata ', ' Knowledge ', ' Testing ', ' Attitude ', ' Dimensions ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Belief ', ' Equation ', ' Digit structure ', ' Digit ', ' Proxy ', ' cultural competence ', ' parental role ', ' parent role ', ' Agreement ', ' outreach ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Emotional ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' comparison group ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 17 year old ', ' seventeen year old ', ' age 17 years ', ' 18 year old ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIMH,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R21,2009,129600,0.03896925970284357

"Effect of Prescription Drug Benefits on Cardiovascular Outcomes in the Elderly  In 2006, the United States implemented the Medicare Modernization Act, which expanded prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries at an estimated cost of $768 billion dollars over the next decade. Improved access to drug benefits may improve cardiovascular outcomes for the elderly by providing financial access to effective therapy. However, there is limited research about the impact of prescription drug coverage on health outcomes. In addition, although black enrollees have been found to have markedly lower use of antihypertensive, lipid-lowering and anti-platelet medications, little is known about the role of prescription drug coverage as a mediator of racial and socioeconomic disparities in cardiovascular outcomes.             In this project, we will investigate the effect of prescription drug benefits on the use of appropriate secondary preventive medication and achievement of favorable clinical outcomes among Medicare managed care enrollees with cardiovascular disease. The project will also assess the role of prescription drug coverage in explaining racial and socioeconomic disparities in cardiovascular outcomes.  Effective drugs, such as aspirin, beta-blockers, statins, and ace-inhibitors, are a cornerstone in the prevention and treatment of heart disease, yet over half of appropriate patients do not receive them. The cost of chronic drug therapy is a substantial barrier for elderly patients who have lower fixed incomes and sizable out-of- pocket spending on health care. This study will assess the effect of prescription drug coverage on outcomes of care for elderly patients with coronary heart disease.",Effect of Prescription Drug Benefits on Cardiovascular Outcomes

"Randomized Trial of IFCBT-HIVPI to Prevent HIV Among Non-Injection Drug Users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a second revision of a competitive renewal R01 proposal of the NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study in response to NIDA PAS-07-115 (Non-injection Dug Abuse and HIV/AIDS). The primary study aim is to evaluate the ability of Integrated Family and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy-HIV Prevention Intervention (IFCBT-HIVPI) to prevent HIV among adult non-injection and injection drug users. Over a 12 week intervention interval, the IFCBT-HIVPI model coordinates the delivery of cognitive- behavioral components during 12 group sessions with a couples and family systems component during 4 couples/family sessions to address HIV risk and protective factors across multiple ecological systems. IFCBT-HIVPI main effects on primary (HIV sexual risk behaviors and HIV drug taking risk behaviors) and secondary (HIV, Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis incidences and legal involvement, academic achievement, and employment) outcome domains will be evaluated. We also seek to elucidate the degree to which the development of attitudinal and behavior change skills targeted by IFCBT-HIVPI (e.g., rational beliefs, problem solving skill, adaptive couples' communication) result in post-intervention reductions of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and HIV risk behaviors. The possibility of effect-modification is also considered with a focus on route of drug administration status (i.e., non-injector/injector), neuropsychological (e.g., executive function), and demographic (i.e., African American/white) factors. The proposed study will randomly assign 360 HIV-negative non-injection and injection drug users recruited from the original NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study sample to experimental (IFCBT-HIVPI) and comparison (Brief Psychoeducation Curriculum on HIV Prevention; BPEC-HIV) conditions. The composition of the original NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study sample provides the basis to stratify the randomized trial sample across gender and two race/ethnicity (i.e., African American and white) groups by route of drug administration status. An assessment battery comprised of a standardized interview on HIV risk behavior, neuropsychological tests, tools to assess attitudes and behavior change skills targeted by IFCBT-HIVPI, drug and STI urine testing, and serologic tests of HIV will be administered before, during, and after the intervention interval across 18-month post-intervention follow-up. Additional preliminary analyses will be conducted on the randomized trial data to: (1) derive session-by-session measures on mechanisms of change targeted by IFCBT-HIVPI via videotape coding methods; (2) characterize mechanisms of change trajectories that may then be evaluated as plausible intervention moderators if present; and (3) estimate intervention cost-effectiveness. The lack of research on science-based prevention interventions for HIV continues to be a serious gap in the literature with recent HIV trends highlighting significant health disparities, particularly among African American non-injection drug users. If successful, the proposed project should help to identify specific attitudinal and behavior change skills targeted by cognitive- behavioral and couples/family systems interventions that foster subsequent reductions in HIV, STIs and HIV risk behaviors among adult drug users at heightened disease risk. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent estimates suggest that a majority of the 40,000 new cases of HIV reported annually in the US are attributable largely to sexual risk behavior associated with non-injection drug use. Additionally, African American drug users exhibit substantial HIV health disparities with African American females being 21 times more likely to contract HIV than white females. The proposed project is designed to address critical gaps in the HIV prevention science field by evaluating the ability of an intervention coordinating cognitive-behavioral and couples/family systems components to prevent HIV among adult drug users at heightened disease risk.           PROJECT NARRATIVE.

"Drugs, sexual impulsivity, HIV: Psychosocial and cognitive risk factors of YMSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unprotected sexual intercourse between men constitutes 58% of all reported cases of AIDS and 80% of HIV cases 1,2. Rates of HIV infection among 15 to 24 year olds continue to increase with MSM behavior remaining the leading cause of HIV infection among adolescent males 1,2. Over 90% of YMSM have reported having more than one sexual partner in the past 6 months and between 33% and 49% have had unprotected anal intercourse during the same time3. Studies show that use of stimulants, particularly methamphetamine, may influence risky sexual practices and contribute to the most recent wave of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)4-6. Systematic development of theory has been identified as a crucial step in efficacious intervention development, but previous conceptual models have focused on a relatively limited array of explanatory constructs. However, Social Action Theory (SAT)7 provides a promising model for examining the risk behavior of YMSM, because it includes individual as well as social and contextual determinants. SAT remains to be tested for use in the field of HIV and with YMSM, because this model was originally conceived as a general health promotion model for the adult population. Using data from the Dr. Kipke's NIDA funded ""Healthy Young Men Study"" (HYM), this study will conduct multivariate analysis to test this model for use with the YMSM population. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) To empirically validate the chain of relationships depicted in Social Action Theory to determine if the theory addresses the interaction of individual, contextual, and social correlates of sexual and drug risk taking behaviors as they relate to YMSM; and 2) To further validate SAT by testing and incorporating competing theoretical relationships depicted in other behavioral theory models to develop a comprehensive theory of the social, psychosocial and cognitive risk factors for drug use, sexual impulsivity, and HIV among YMSM to guide prevention intervention efforts. . This study will contribute to the objectives of the AIDS-Science Track Award for Research Transition by 1) supporting a New Researcher; 2) addressing the NIDA research objective in the area of HIV, drug abuse, impulsivity, and coping strategies of an at-risk, under represented population; and 3) through refinement of a comprehensive theoretical model, we will provide a platform for developing interventions that address risk behavior related to HIV transmission among YMSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will contribute to effective HIV interventions for at-risk youth by developing a model to understand how environmental risk factors, impulsivity, and coping strategies converge into drug abuse and sexual risk taking.           Proposal Narrative This study will contribute to effective HIV interventions for at-risk youth by developing a model to understand how environmental risk factors, impulsivity, and coping strategies converge into drug abuse and sexual risk taking.","Drugs, sexual impulsivity, HIV: Psychosocial and cognitive risk factors of YMSM",7685401,R03DA024976,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' adolescent boy ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Area ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Funding ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methamphetamine ', ' N-Methylamphetamine ', ' Methylamphetamine ', ' Desoxyephedrine ', ' Deoxyephedrine ', ' Crystal Meth ', ' Benzeneethanamine, N,alpha-dimethyl-, (S)- ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Shapes ', ' Anus ', ' Anal ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Science ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Life ', ' Anti-HIV Agents ', ' antiAIDS agent ', ' Anti-Human Immunodeficiency Virus Agents ', ' Anti-HIV Drugs ', ' Anti-AIDS Drugs ', ' Anti-AIDS Agents ', ' AIDS Drugs ', ' Testing ', ' Complex ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' psychosocial ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' peer ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Case Study ', ' case report ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Coitus ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Communities ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' coping ', ' Guide prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R03,2009,168543,0.050969097749700466
"Clinical and Social Implications of Cost Sharing for Cancer Drugs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Yu-Ning Wong, a Medical Oncologist at Fox Chase Cancer Center is dedicated to a career in cancer health services research. Her goal is to develop a multidisciplinary research program to understand the impact of insurance design on cancer drug utilization and clinical outcomes. This Career Development Award will provide the means to take two important steps towards accomplishing this goal. First, it will allow for additional intensive mentored education and training in public policy research, health economics, and advanced statistical methods that will augment the candidate's previous rigorous training in epidemiology, biostatistics, and clinical medicine. Second, it will support the development of an original clinical research program using rigorous epidemiologic, econometric and survey methods to examine the impact of prescription drug insurance coverage on cancer outcomes. As new costly cancer drugs are introduced, patients with both public and private insurance are facing higher out- of-pocket costs. Cost sharing between insurers and patients (though co-payments and deductibles) has been traditionally used to control costs based on an expectation that unnecessary health care utilization will be reduced. However this expectation may result in worse socioeconomic disparities in care since some patients may be unable to afford highly effective cancer treatments. The candidate proposes three complementary studies to address the important, unanswered questions about the impact of cost sharing on cancer outcomes. Project A is a conjoint analysis-based survey to measure how patients make decisions among treatments of varying efficacy, toxicity and cost. Project B uses the results from Project A in a decision analysis model to measure the sensitivity of clinical outcomes to price and patient preferences. This will also allow us to determine if is possible to improve clinical outcomes by using low cost sharing to increase adherence to high value treatments. Project C is a natural experiment using insurance claims to measure the effect of insurance design and sociodemographic factors on the receipt of a new, expensive anti-nausea medication and subsequent outcomes. This research program will triangulate on the nexus of issues central to the understanding of cost sharing on cancer drug utilization and clinical outcomes and form the foundation for the candidate's transition to an independent investigator in cancer health services research. This project will have broad implications for the financing of high cost medical interventions because it will help policy makers, insurers and physicians understand how current models of cost sharing may contribute to socioeconomic disparities in cancer care. Our results may suggest consideration of a novel benefit design that encourages patients to make decisions based on relative value, rather than cost alone.

"Substance Use and Risky Sex in Highly Vulnerable Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed project will help me develop the skills and expertise necessary to establish an independent research career focused on the role of substance use in sexual risk-taking behavior and associated adverse reproductive outcomes, especially sexually transmitted infections (STIs). To achieve this goal, I will supplement my graduate training as a developmental psychologist and postdoctoral training in epidemiology with training in sexual risk behavior in vulnerable populations, health disparities associated with race, and career development in longitudinal research methodology. Complementary to these training activities, I propose: 1) secondary data analyses of sexual risk behavior and outcomes using data from an ongoing longitudinal study of the offspring of teenage mothers and a study of women with and without borderline personality disorder (BPD); 2) collection of new data on the offspring of teenage mothers during a 16-year assessment and; 3) a new pilot study of common STIs in this sample (offspring of teenage mothers). The proposed research will form the basis for an R01 application in the third year of the award period. My short term goals are to (1) increase knowledge about risk for STIs, including behavioral dysregulation that may underlie risky sex and risk factors associated with risky sex and associated outcomes, (2) learn new methods of measuring risk behavior and adverse reproductive outcomes, including clinical tests for STIs and  event-level assessments, (3) learn more about health disparities associated with race, and (4) develop the research skills that will enable me to become an independent investigator and obtain NIH funding to support my research, specifically longitudinal data analyses. My long-term career goal is to understand the ecological setting for drug use and sexual risk behaviors in vulnerable populations, and how drug use may contribute to significantly higher rates of unintended pregnancies and STIs in African-American youth. The proposed career development training will take place at the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. This department provides an outstanding environment for interdisciplinary training by highly collaborative faculty who are leading experts in their chosen fields. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed research will help identify behavioral risk factors for sexually transmitted infections that are implicated in higher rates of HIV, especially among African-Americans. The results can be used to develop prevention programs aimed at reducing drug use and sexually transmitted infections among vulnerable adolescents and within psychiatric populations.

"HIV Infection in Ethnic Minority IDUs: An International Systematic Review    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial/ethnic group disparities in HIV/AIDS are a critical public health issue in the US. These disparities are particularly dramatic with respect to injecting drug use. African-Americans constitute 13% of the US population and 52% of recent US injecting drug use AIDS cases; Hispanics constitute 14% of the US population and 24% of the injecting drug use AIDS cases. These disparities are not the result of more injecting drug users among African-Americans and Hispanics, but of higher rates of HIV infection among African- American and Hispanic IDUs in many areas of the country. Similar disparities-higher rates of HIV infection among ethnic minority IDUs-have also been observed in many foreign countries. Indeed the situation of ethnic minority IDUs in some developing countries can be considered a crisis, with extremely high incidence, prevalence and HIV-related mortality. Disparities have also been observed among non-injecting drug users, with ethnic minority group members having higher rates of HIV infection. The logical next step for addressing these disparities and this epidemiological conundrum is not another individual study, but a systematic review of the large number of relevant studies that have been conducted to date. Our proposed systematic review will use state-of-the-art methods and include the US and the international data on ethnic group differences in HIV infection among drug users. The specific aims include: Developing procedures for combining qualitative and quantitative data from multiple research studies of IDUs in a single geographic area into a ""history of the HIV epidemic among IDUs"" in that area. Determining the frequency of HIV epidemics in which substantial differences in HIV infection have and have not arisen in ethnic minority IDUs vs. ethnic majority IDUs in the US and internationally. Identifying potential causal factors that may generate substantial differences in HIV prevalence among racial/ethnic minority vs. ethnic majority IDUs. Identifying potential causal factors that may perpetuate or reduce differences in HIV infection among racial/ethnic differences over time. Identifying epidemiologic situations in which differences in HIV risk behaviors do or do not statistically ""explain"" differences in HIV infection among racial/ethnic groups of IDUs. The research will also create an extremely rich dataset on HIV infection among ethnic drug uses that will be made available for use by other researchers and HIV prevention service providers. The research addresses one of the most important aspects of HIV/AIDS-the frequent large disparities in HIV infection among ethnic groups in the US and in many other countries. The research will be an innovative application of state of the art methods for systematic review, including extensive searching for published and unpublished studies, quantitative coding of research reports, and applying meta-regression/hierarchical modeling to these problems.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Higher rates of HIV infection among African-American and Hispanic IDUs are a major health disparity in the US. African-Americans comprise 13% of the US population and 52% of injection drug use AIDS cases, Hispanics 14% of the populations and 24% of cases. Similar disparities, higher rates of HIV infection among ethnic minority IDUs, have also been observed in many foreign countries. An international systematic review and meta-analysis should greatly advance our understanding of these disparities and suggest how they might be ameliorated.          ",HIV Infection in Ethnic Minority IDUs: An International Systematic Review,7649431,R01DA024612,"['Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ethnic group ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Europe ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Procedures ', ' Health Services Needs ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non-A non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non A non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis nonA nonB ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' PT-NANBH ', ' Non-B Hepatitis Parenterally-Transmitted Non-A ', ' NANBH ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' systematic review ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Incidence ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Glare ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Nation ', ' Developed Country ', ' North America ', ' Drug user ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Arts ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Asia ', ' Time ', ' Australia ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' Services ', ' prevention service ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' repository ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' user-friendly ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' non-drug ', ' nondrug ', ' ']",NIDA,BETH ISRAEL MEDICAL CTR (NEW YORK),R01,2009,545434,0.06950887935870406
"African American Female Drug Users: HIV, Health Disparities, & Criminality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this study is to understand how drug use and criminality are related to health disparities, particularly HIV, and service utilization among African American drug using and non-drug using women across criminal justice status. While drug use is similar across racial groups in the US, African Americans are disproportionately more likely to experience severe health consequences and criminal involvement as a result of drug misuse. Adequate health care may not be received by African American female offenders because they experience the burden of their race, class, gender, and criminal offender status. There is limited scientific data to help understand the linkages between health disparities such as HIV, untreated drug abuse, barriers to service utilization, and status as a criminal offender among African American females. This study is significant because of its potential to identify differences in health disparities and service utilization among African American drug using and non-drug using women in selected levels of criminal justice status (intensive correctional supervision-prison (n=200), moderate correctional supervision-jail (n=200), community supervision-probation (n=200), and no criminal justice involvement (n=200)). All 800 African American females will be followed longitudinally for three 6-month intervals to examine health status and the use of health services across time. The specific aims are: (1) To describe the prevalence of health problems among African American women across criminal justice status and drug use status; (2) To determine the cultural, predisposing, historical health, and potential enabling factors that are predictors of health problems among African American drug using and non-drug using women across criminal justice status over 18 months; (3) To describe the prevalence of untreated health problems, the patterns of health services utilization, and the cultural barriers to service utilization among African American women across criminal justice status and drug use status; and (4) To examine the factors that predict the likelihood of using health services among African American drug using and non-drug using women across criminal justice status over 18 months. The significance of this study includes the potential to provide criminal justice systems-level data for health planning and health policy for prevention, intervention, and treatment of African American female drug users.       This study is significant to the public health field because of its potential to understand the severity of health disparities among African American women across criminal justice status and drug use status and to predict health status and the use of health services over time. This knowledge of African American females can be used as a foundation for future criminal justice systems-level interventions to increase the use of preventative health care and subsequently reduce the need for expensive medical services, as well as to decrease HIV risk behaviors including drug use, unprotected sex, and recidivism.          ","African American Female Drug Users: HIV, Health

"Familias Unidas Stage III Study: Preventing Substance Abuse in Hispanic Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study's overarching goal is to reduce the ethnic disparities in illicit drug use, cigarette use, and HIV between Hispanic and non-Hispanic youth. This goal will be accomplished by four aims: AIM 1 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Practice (i.e., standard prevention services), in preventing illicit drug use; AIM 2 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Control, in preventing cigarette use; AIM 3 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Control, in preventing unprotected sexual behavior; and AIM 4 is to assess the extent to which family functioning mediates the effects of the intervention on illicit drug use, cigarette use, and unprotected sexual behavior. Twenty four middle schools with a total sample of 744 Hispanic adolescents from a wide geographic area of Miami-Dade County will be randomized using a block design to one of two conditions: Familias Unidas or Community Practice. The Familias Unidas intervention has been evaluated and found to be efficacious in two separate randomized controlled trials. In the first study (Pantin et al., 2003), Familias Unidas was shown to be efficacious relative to a no intervention control condition in increasing family functioning and reducing behavior problems (Prado et al., 2006), risk factors for youth illicit drug use and unprotected sex. In the second randomized controlled trial (Prado et al., in press), Familias Unidas was found to be efficacious, relative to two attention control conditions, in preventing cigarette use and illicit drug use. Familias Unidas was also found to be efficacious relative to both of the control conditions in preventing/reducing unprotected sexual behavior at last sexual intercourse. Finally, family functioning was found to mediate the effects of intervention condition on the outcomes. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) will be used to test: (H1) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing illicit drug use over time; (H2) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing cigarette use over time; and (H3) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing unprotected sexual behavior over time. Additionally HLM will be used to determine whether (H1a) the effect of Familias Unidas on illicit drug use will be partially mediated by family functioning; (H2a) the effect of Familias Unidas on cigarette use will be partially mediated by family functioning and (H3a) the effect of Familias Unidas on unprotected sexual behavior will be partially mediated by family functioning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of the proposed study is to reduce illicit drug use, cigarette use, and unsafe sexual behavior health disparities in Hispanic populations.

"Race and HIV-risk: Contextual and neurocognitive influences on sex partnerships    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this R21 application in response to NIDA's ANSWHR Initiative (PAS-07-381) is to address gaps in literature focused on HIV risk and disparities among females. In the United States as rates have increased among females, the rate of HIV/AIDS diagnoses for African American females approaches 25 times the rate for white females. Despite the broad base of findings documenting health disparities in HIV, extant studies cannot explain why African Americans continue to be disproportionately affected. Currently, there is a hidden HIV epidemic among young adult African American females with no history of substance abuse. These women are at increased risk for contracting HIV by virtue of their social networks. The proposed study requests two years of support for a cross sectional epidemiologic examination of racial/ethnic differences in sexual partnerships among 220 females (110 Black and 110 White) residing in low socioeconomic status (SES) neighborhoods. Guided by ecosocial theory, we seek to explain why these differences exist across race/ethnicity. We will consider the extent to which neighborhood social and economic factors (e.g., drug markets) interact with race/ethnicity to produce different levels of HIV risk. We will expand drug abuse and HIV prevention research by, in addition to considering individual differences, examining the influences of neighborhood drug markets on the sexual behaviors, sexual partnerships and rates of a sexually transmitted disease among young adult females residing in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Finally, the proposed study will move beyond descriptive social epidemiology and into identifying neurocognitive processes that mediate/moderate relationships between neighborhood factors and individual behavior. As, a small yet growing base of research suggests, to the extent that individuals are able to make decisions, solve problems and control impulses, neurocognitive functions may serve as protective factors or pathways through which external social factors influence individual behavior. Identifying social factors that influence partner selection and individual level factors that may serve to reduce the adverse effects of living in disadvantage neighborhoods will inform HIV prevention interventions for African American and underserved women. If successful, the proposed research project: (1) should provide insight into why African American females have higher rates of HIV than their white counterparts; (2) highlight the importance of considering the contextual influences of drugs, that is the influence of drug markets on social structures and sexual norms and behaviors; and (3) identify modifiable individual level factors linking neighborhood social and economic factors to individual HIV risk behaviors.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Currently, there is a hidden HIV epidemic among young adult African American females with no history of substance abuse.

"Economic Evaluation of Drug Abuse Treatment and HIV Prevention Services for Pregn    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Economic evaluation of drug abuse treatment and HIV prevention services for pregnant women is critical to identify the most efficient and equitable use of scarce resources. Economic and policy research on the efficiency of drug abuse treatment and HIV prevention services among vulnerable populations such as women, adolescents and members of minority groups is necessary to improve drug abuse and HIV/AIDS services for these vulnerable and underserved populations. While work in this area continues to grow, there is still a dearth of rigorous economic evaluations of such programs, especially those that adhere to quality standards as recommended by the U.S. Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. The overall objective of this study is to conduct the first economic evaluation of an innovative behavioral approach integrating Motivational Enhancement Therapy with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET-CBT) as compared to standard Brief Advice (BA) within prenatal care to decrease use of a full range of substances (e.g., marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines, alcohol, nicotine), to reduce HIV risk behavior and to achieve better infant health outcomes (e.g. longer gestations, greater birth weight, reduced medical consequences such as admission and length of stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)). The specific aims of this study are: (1) to conduct cost analyses of the MET-CBT and BA intervention arms; (2) to conduct incremental cost-effectiveness analyses of the two interventions (MET-CBT and BA), vis-`-vis each other, in terms of substance use, infant health outcomes and HIV risk reduction; and (3) to conduct incremental cost-utility analyses determining the net cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) saved respectively by each intervention arm (MET-CBT and BA), vis-`-vis each other, in terms of substance use and HIV risk reduction. The proposed research is responsive to PA-07-122 in that it proposes to conduct research related to cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses, services costs, methodological research, and the cross-cutting themes of HIV/AIDS and health disparities. The proposed research is grounded in sound microeconomic principles and standardized techniques as reported in the U.S. Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine, and proposes rigorous conceptual and methodological research to improve the evidence base on the unit costs and cost-effectiveness of substance abuse treatment and HIV prevention services. It builds on a NIDA-funded randomized controlled trial (R01-DA019135) of an innovate behavioral approach, which offers a new paradigm of treatment services, integrating MET-CBT within prenatal care compared to standard BA, and offering promise to improve access to and strengthen substance use treatment and HIV prevention services targeted at drug using pregnant women who are highly susceptible to HIV/AIDS.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug abuse and high risk HIV behavior during pregnancy are major public health problems in the United States due to their impact on individual users, their offspring, and surrounding communities. Drug abuse and HIV prevention programs targeting pregnant women have the potential to be cost-effective due to the resultant fewer low-birth-weight babies and perinatal deaths, fewer physical, cognitive and behavioral problems during infancy and childhood, and the significant health benefits that can accrue to the mother. The overall objective of this study is to conduct the first economic evaluation of an innovative behavioral approach integrating Motivational Enhancement Therapy with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET-CBT) as compared to standard Brief Advice (BA) within prenatal care to decrease use of a full range of substances (e.g., marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines, alcohol, nicotine), to reduce HIV risk behavior and to achieve better infant health outcomes (e.g. longer gestations, greater birth weight, reduced medical consequences such as admission and length of stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)).           PROJECT NARRATIVE Drug abuse and high risk HIV behavior during pregnancy are major public health problems in the United States due to their impact on individual users, their offspring, and surrounding communities.

"Screening and Brief Intervention for Latino and non-Latino White Drug Users DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (05): Comparative Effectiveness Research and specific Challenge Topic, 05-DA-104: Comparing Drug Treatment Effectiveness in Ethnic Minority Populations.  Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is a comprehensive, integrated public health approach to identify and deliver a spectrum of early detection and treatment services for substance use in general medical care settings.  The effectiveness of SBIRT has been demonstrated in numerous studies, and SBIRT is considered best practice by leading national medical associations for identifying and treating substance misuse even at early states.  However, it is not known if SBIRT is effective for Latino/Hispanic populations, an important gap in knowledge given the large and growing numbers of Latinos, their relatively high drug use prevalence, and the disparities between Latinos and other ethnic/racial groups in terms of substance abuse treatment.  This 2-year study will evaluate the effectiveness of SBIRT for drug use and related factors among 500 Latino and 500 non-Latino Whites visiting a large urban emergency department for various reasons.  A randomized two-group repeated measures design will be used in which drug-related outcomes of an intervention group will be compared to those of an attention-placebo control group.  Participants who report illicit drug use will be recruited from the waiting room of a large hospital Emergency Department, and randomly assigned to one of the two conditions.  The intervention group (¿Life Shift¿) will receive SBIRT drug intervention matched to their risk level and drug of choice.  To assess the ¿true¿ effect of the SBIRT intervention (I.e., minus the effects of attention), a control group will receive the same quantity of intervention in the area of driving safety (¿Shift Gears¿).  Baseline and 6-month follow-up measures will be collected for all participants, and will include (a) standardized subjective drug use measures, (b) other measures presumed to be targeted by the intervention (e.g., functional status, perceived barriers to change), and (c) a biological sample tested for the presence or absence of multiple illicit drugs to increase the accuracy of subjective abstinence reports at the follow-up.  In addition, driving safety control items will be collected to test the result of the experimental manipulation, with the attention-placebo control group expected to have greater pre-post change on these measures than the SBIRT intervention group.  Latino/White differences in responses to the intervention will be the primary focus of the study.  Generalized estimating equations (GEE) will be sued to test intervention-control group differences in follow-up abstinence rates, and whether experimental group differences hold for both Latinos and non-Latino Whites.  Impact of the intervention on other outcomes including frequency and amount of drug use, functioning in life areas, subsequent health care utilization, and presumed intermediate variables targeted by the intervention will also be analyzed overall and by ethnic group.  Process and implementation variables, (e.g., intervention coverage, observational quality measures, patient satisfaction) will be collected to measure fidelity of implementation, and to assess possible ethnic differences.  This randomized control group study will be the first to establish if screening and brief intervention delivered in primary care settings during a ¿teachable moment¿ can motivate both Latino and non-Latino Whites to reduce drug involvement.

"Research Training in the Prevention of Drug Abuse & AIDS in Communities of Color    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised application for a MIDARP program at Howard University describes a mentoring program in drug abuse research and AIDS prevention in communities of color, which is designed to increase the capacity of faculty and students at Howard to conduct rigorous and competitive research in the prevention of drug abuse and HIV/AIDS in communities of color. The program will emphasize training in transdisciplinary research on relationships between environmental stress, biological responses, risk behaviors and health outcomes and will utilize collaborations with senior investigators in research intensive universities to mentor Howard faculty investigators. The MIDARP will also work closely with existing programs that link Howard faculty and students to research training opportunities to (1) increase knowledge and interest in drug abuse and AIDS prevention research among faculty and students in these programs and (2) utilize the resources of these programs to expand the range of training opportunities available to MIDARP investigators and students. Howard students will be introduced to drug abuse and AIDS prevention research and career development by augmenting existing drug abuse courses in the College of Arts and Sciences and the curriculum for medical, basic science, nursing, and pharmacy students to include information on drug abuse and AIDS prevention research. They will also fund a pre-doctoral dissertation stipend and recruit students to serve as research assistants in the MIDARP pilot studies. The unique strengths of the program include the opportunity to (1) integrate education regarding drug abuse and AIDS prevention research into existing research training programs for faculty and students;(2) train individuals in diverse disciplines such as the health professions and sciences (i.e., medicine, basic sciences, pharmacy, nursing) who are less likely to pursue research careers in drug abuse and AIDS prevention research; and (3) support transdisciplinary research in drug use and AIDS prevention based on strong existing university research programs in genetics, physiology, and psychobiology. A transdisciplinary approach will be reflected in the MIDARP leadership that includes a Director who is a behavioral scientist specializing in research on environmental stress, drug use, and AIDS risk in communities of color and a Deputy Director who is an immunogeneticist with expertise in microbiology, and founding Director of the Human Genome Project at Howard University.          ",Research Training in the Prevention of Drug Abuse & AIDS in Communities of Color,7678555,R24DA021470,"['Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Ally ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Allied Health Sciences ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' Training and Infrastructure ', ' Monitor ', ' Authorization documentation ', ' Permission ', ' Authorization ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Behavioral ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' Foundations ', ' base ', ' career ', ' role model ', ' sociology/anthropology ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Occupations ', ' health science profession ', ' Health Professions ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human Genome Project ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Leadership ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Measurement ', ' Development Plans ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Funding ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nurses ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Genetic ', ' Physiology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Exposure to ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychology ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Science ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Sociology ', ' Knowledge ', ' lectures ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Medical Students ', ' Nursing Students ', ' Pupil Nurses ', ' Pharmacy Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Award ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' graduate student ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' career development ', ' psychobiology ', ' biopsychology ', ' biological basis of behavior ', ' response ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' heart rate variability ', ' Consultations ', ' ']",NIDA,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,R24,2009,471118,0.15242078635463338
"Incarceration Effects on Prevention of Drug Use, STI-HIV and Recidivism Incarcerated women are often affected by childhood abuse, violence, and other difficult life circumstances throughout their life course, and typically come from disproportionately disadvantaged neighborhoods. However, relatively less research has examined how neighborhood characteristics and incarceration interact with inmates' risk factors. Although several criminal justice studies demonstrated that excessive incarceration may exacerbate community disadvantages and instability as a large proportion of residents constantly move between jail and community, the impact of neighborhood disadvantages on inmates' health outcomes, such as drug use and sexual risks have not been examined. Furthermore, while the rate of female incarceration has steadily increased over the past 20 years, previous studies predominantly concern with men, and women's unique life trajectories of incarceration, sexual risks, and drug use have been less understood. The study proposes to examine the impact and consequences of incarceration on the patterns of substance use, risky sexual behaviors, and recidivism among female inmates who are returning to the community from a large urban jail. The proposed conceptual model will be tested explaining the ecological factors associated with incarceration, and the impact of incarceration on drug use, STls/HlV risks, and recidivism among female inmates. To achieve the objectives, the proposed study will conduct: 1) qualitative in-depth interviews with women in jail exploring their experience with incarceration, changes in social networks and support, health  concerns, health care and social services utilization, expected challenges upon release, and needs for successful transition to community life; 2) face-to-face longitudinal surveys with a cohort of female inmates at three time points (baseline in jail, and two weeks and three months post-release) to examine primary outcomes (relapse to drug use, risks for STIs/HlV infection, recidivism), secondary outcomes, and mediators (social network, social support); and 3) multi-level analysis and mapping to explore the effects of neighborhood disadvantage and instability, the rates of incarceration and STIs on women's outcomes. Incarcerated women are often from the poor, minority, urban populations who are most affected by drug abuse and HIV. The rate of female incarceration has dramatically increased in recent years, while the majority of them return to the community along with their health problems. Findings of the research wilt help better understand incarcerated women's complex health, socioeconomic issues and community context, which may contribute to reducing health disparities among women living in disadvantaged neighborhoods.","Incarceration Effects on Prevention of Drug Use, STI-HIV and Recidivism",7884973,R00DA024012,"['drug abuse prevention ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Employment ', ' Social Network ', ' Jail ', ' Data ', ' Social Health Services ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Affect ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Maps ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Poverty ', ' Prisoner ', ' jail inmate ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' Probability ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Life ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urban Population ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' recidivism ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' offender ', ' criminal offender ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Child Abuse ', ' Childhood Abuse ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Modeling ', ' Communities ', ' human capital ', ' reincarceration ', ' Minority ', ' community living ', ' Outcome ', ' Alcohol dependence ', ' alcohol-dependent ', ' alcohol dependency ', ' alcohol addiction ', ' service utilization ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R00,2009,249000,0.08478374343868396
"The Growing Disparity in Illegal Drug Use Across Socioeconomic Strata    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A disparity in illegal drug use that disadvantages individuals in the lower socioeconomic strata has significantly increased in the last two decades. New evidence indicates that this increase results in large part from a changing influence of socioeconomic status (SES) on drug use, and not from a negative influence of drug use on SES that has accumulated over time. However, the SES-related influences responsible for this growing disparity remain largely unknown. . The aims of this study are threefold. First, it will address limitations in current evidence on the growing disparity of illegal drug use across socioeconomic strata. Using the most current, available data the project will (a) update analyses of socioeconomic trends in cocaine past 1998 (b) examine socioeconomic trends up to the present in illegal drugs that have not yet been examined, such as marijuana, methamphetamine, ecstasy, and 'blunts,1 (c) examine whether the growing disparity sterns from differential incidence and/or differential duration of drug use across socioeconomic strata, and (d) examine SES indicators other than education. These analyses will use the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, a nationally- representative, cross-sectional survey of drug use administered yearly, although between 1979 and 1988 it was administered only every third year. Second, the study will predict both changes in the prevalence of illegal drugs over time and also changes in the characteristics of illegal drug users over time. We use a ""Diffusion of Innovation"" framework, which predicts that users of an innovation such as illegal drugs fall into distinct categories such as ""innovators,"" ""early adopters,"" and ""late adopters."" People in each of these categories are theorized to differ from each other in terms of sociodemographic, psychological, and environmental characteristics. Furthermore, the profiles of drug users at one point in time are expected to predict the prevalence of drug use in the future. The third aim of the project is to trace the extent to which the key predictors of illegal drug use, as highlighted by the Diffusion framework, have their roots in the early life course. Using a longitudinal survey that has followed 838 children from 1st grade to age 30, the analysis will examine how far back in the life course current predictors of illegal drug use extend. We expect that many early predictors have not yet been linked to later drug use because the current profile of illegal drug users, which includes factors such as low socioeconomic status, did not emerge until recently. Results from this project will inform policy and intervention programs aimed at reducing the prevalence of illegal drug use across all socioeconomic strata.              ",The Growing Disparity in Illegal Drug Use Across Socioeconomic Strata,7658761,R01DA020575,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' ecstasy ', ' N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine ', ' N,alpha-dimethyl-1,3-benzodioxole-5-ethanamine ', ' Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ', ' MDMA ', ' 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine ', ' Diffusion ', ' Diffusion of Innovation ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Policy Research ', ' Update ', ' trend ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Funding ', ' Marihuana ', ' marijuana ', ' Marijuana Smoking ', ' marijuana use ', ' Methamphetamine ', ' N-Methylamphetamine ', ' Methylamphetamine ', ' Desoxyephedrine ', ' Deoxyephedrine ', ' Crystal Meth ', ' Benzeneethanamine, N,alpha-dimethyl-, (S)- ', ' Drug user ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Social Mobility ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Adopted ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' first grade ', ' directed attention ', ' directs attention ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' intervention program ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' falls ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cocaine ', ' 8-Azabicyclo(3.2.1)octane-2-carboxylic acid, 3-(benzoyloxy)-8-methyl-, methyl ester, (1R-(exo,exo))- ', ' Accounting ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' stem ', ' cocaine use ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2009,309605,0.22637589368278796
"HIV - Emergence of Drug Resistance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is to renew a project focused on using mathematical models to understand and predict the emergence of drug resistance to antiretrovirals (ARVs) for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). As the usage rate of ARVs in resource-poor regions is increasing, high levels of drug resistance potentially could emerge and have a devastating impact on public health worldwide, derailing global plans to provide this treatment to many millions of HIV-infected individuals. Our proposed projects will extend the work of the current award, which showed the value of using mathematical models to understand the temporal dynamics of drug-resistant strains of HIV in the United States (US), and for predicting the magnitude of resistance in this setting. In the renewal our work will be extended by combining mathematical modeling with statistical analysis of datasets collected by collaborating groups in the US, Europe and Africa. We will have access to data on drug resistance and important related variables from large scale epidemiological and treatment studies conducted in these three continents. In resource-poor settings, such as Africa, drugs will be limited and thus demand will often greatly exceed supply. We will investigate the problems of allocating ARVs in Africa by using operation research (OR) techniques. We have three Specific Aims. Aim 1: to understand the emergence, explain the present, and predict the evolution of, complex epidemics of drug-resistant strains of HIV in the US and Europe. Aim 2: to predict the evolution of epidemics of drug-resistant strains, as a result of first- line regimens and prophylactic use of ARVs, in Africa. Aim 3: to evaluate the consequences of allocation of scarce HIV healthcare resources in Africa. To achieve this aim we will use models to evaluate the epidemiological and ethical consequences of gender-inequities in access to treatment, assess the epidemiological and ethical impact of treatment priority criteria, and determine healthcare resource allocation strategies that ensure sustainability. Our studies in the renewal will link transmission modeling, OR techniques and statistical analyses; our analyses will take advantage of the extraordinary data sets provided by our collaborators in the US, Europe and Africa.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The emergence and control of drug-resistant strains of HIV is now a global problem. The epidemiology of this problem is complex, and the future of the HIV epidemic is unknown. Our projects focus on using mathematical models to understand, explain, and predict, the evolution of complex epidemics composed of drug-resistant strains of HIV in the US, Europe and Africa. The rollout of antiretrovirals in Africa is just beginning; however demand for drugs greatly exceeds supply. We will, by using mathematical models, evaluate the epidemiological and ethical consequences of allocation of the scarce supply of antiretrovirals in Africa. Our studies are based upon both mathematical modeling and data analyses. Our analyses will take advantage of the extraordinary data sets provided by our collaborators in the US, Europe and Africa. Our results will have direct relevance for health policy makers.          ",HIV - Emergence of Drug Resistance,7574471,R01AI041935,"['Ensure ', ' Linear Models ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ',

"Role of Race in Criminal Justice Referrals to Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The criminal justice system has become the primary source of referrals to drug treatment. Despite substantial evidence that minorities, particularly African Americans, are over-represented in the drug arrestee population, they remain a relatively small share of criminal justice referrals. It has yet to be determined if this lower representation is a function of racial and ethnic disparities in the criminal justice system or an artifact of some common case-level factors that reduce minority eligibility for treatment referral. We propose to examine the adjudication of drug offenders in California from 1982- 2005 to determine the extent to which race/ethnicity has played a role in final disposition and referral to drug treatment. California represents a unique environment in which to examine these associations because of its demographic and regional diversity, availability of detailed administrative data representing a census of individuals arrested and processed, and adoption of two important policies - drug courts and diversion - that promote treatment in lieu of incarceration. The proposed study significantly improves existing research by considering temporal and geographic patterns in disparities at each stage of the adjudication process within a single state subject to the same rule of law. It comprehensively considers the role of race/ethnicity at each stage of the adjudication process and the net effect on the final placement of minorities in treatment, and so may identify why previous studies have provided inconsistent results. Finally, by considering the impact of restorative justice policies, such as drug courts and diversion, on the processing of drug offenders by race/ethnicity, this project will assist policymakers with efforts to reduce disparities in the criminal justice and treatment system. The elimination of health disparities is an overarching goal of Healthy People 2010. The criminal justice system is critical to eliminating disparities because minorities, particularly African Americans, are substantially over-represented in this population and because the criminal justice system is the largest referral source to treatment. A careful examination of the adjudication process for drug offenders will make it possible to determine if differential access to treatment truly exists among arrestees and what factors have caused it. Further, by examining trends in adjudication practices using a large panel data set in California, this study will be able to explicitly consider whether recent policy reforms aimed at improving access to treatment particularly among minorities have indeed done so.           ",Role of Race in Criminal Justice Referrals to Treatment,7574423,R01DA022719,"['Staging ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' SAMHSA ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' California ', ' adjudication ', ' adjudicative process and procedure ', ' offender ', ' criminal offender ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Censuses ', ' County ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' parole ', ' Drug Courts ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Environment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adoption ', ' Guidelines ', ' court ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Justice ', ' Laws ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Noise ', ' Play ', ' ']",NIDA,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2009,344864,0.09882567964943394
"HIV Disparities among Drug Users: Neighborhoods, Neurocognition and Sex Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R03 application proposes to conduct secondary data analysis to develop statistical models that explain disparities in HIV/AIDS found among African American and white substance users. In the proposed study, we will employ advance statistical analyses (latent variable mixture models) to consider the separate and synergistic influence of neighborhood factors (drug arrest rates and poverty), substance use patterns and neurocognitive functioning on sexual risk partnerships and, in turn, HIV/AIDS. First, we will evaluate the possible specificity in relationships between distinct neighborhood level factors (segregation, drug markets, poverty) and sexual partnerships and HIV/AIDS. Aim 2 of the study is to model the influence of neighborhood characteristics, substance use patterns, incarceration and neurocognitve functioning on sexual risk partnerships and estimate prevalence and incidence over an18-month period. The third aim is to estimate the magnitude of the association between sexual partnerships and being HIV-infected. The possibility of effect modification is considered with a focus on race and gender. If successful, this project should improve prevention science by: (1) increasing understanding of sexual risk partnerships among drug users and how they vary across race and gender; (2) providing support for considering factors beyond traditional SES indicators when attempting to understand racial disparities in HIV by highlighting the importance of contextual influences of drugs (e.g., rate of drug arrests) on sexual partnerships; and (3) specifying potential neurocognitive processes that might mediate/moderate the relationship between neighborhood, substance use and sexual risk partnerships. This study is the first in a series of innovative studies designed to explain racial disparities and prevent HIV/AIDS among African Americans.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The intersection between substance use and HIV is a major concern as core and peripheral members of drug networks represent a significant portion of HIV/AIDS cases. Although all persons involved in drug networks are at increased risk for HIV, African Americans tend to be disproportionately affected. Because interventions focused solely on the individual have had limited success in slowing the spread of HIV among African Americans, it is important to elucidate the influence and model the pathways through which social and interpersonal factors influence HIV acquisition.          ","HIV Disparities among Drug Users: Neighborhoods, Neurocognition and Sex Behavior",7603041,R03DA024981,"['Crime ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' To specify ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Fellowship ', ' Female ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Peripheral ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Series ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Incidence ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Funding ', ' Study models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Multiple Partners ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Paper ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Drug user ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Science ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Knowledge ', ' sound ', ' Specificity ', ' Time ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' AIDS/HIV diagnosis ', ' success ', ' member ', ' drug market ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Accounting ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases and Manifestations ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Sex Functioning ', ' sexual functioning ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Neurocognition ', ' person centered ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2009,123000,0.004599709383627865
"Preventing Drug Abuse and HIV in Hispanic First Offenders Hispanic youth in the juvenile justice system are at increased risk of HIV infection and of using illicit drugs. The proposed study’s overarching goal is to reduce the ethnic disparities in illicit drug use and HIV between Hispanic and non-Hispanic youth in the criminal justice system. The proposed 2-year study will be guided by four aims. AIM 1 is to evaluate the efficacy of Familias Unidas, relative to Treatment as Usual in preventing illicit drug use in a sample of Hispanic youth first offenders; AIM 2 is to evaluate the efficacy of Familias Unidas, relative to Treatment as Usual in preventing unsafe sexual behavior; AIM 3 is to evaluate the efficacy of Familias Unidas, relative to Treatment as Usual in reducing the number of subsequent criminal offenses; and AIM 4 is to assess the extent to which family functioning mediates the effects of the intervention on illicit drug use, unsafe sexual behavior, and subsequent criminal offenses. 240 Hispanic adolescent first offenders (age range 13 to 17) and their parents will be randomized to either Familias Unidas or Treatment as Usual. Youth and parent participants will be assed at baseline, post-intervention (i.e., 6-months post baseline), and 12-months post baseline.   The Familias Unidas intervention has been evaluated and found to be efficacious in two randomized trials. In the first study (Pantin et al., 2003), Familias Unidas was shown to be efficacious relative to a no intervention control condition in increasing family functioning and reducing behavior problems. In the second randomized trial (Prado et al., 2007), Familias Unidas was found to be efficacious, relative to two attention control conditions, in reducing illicit drug use and unprotected sexual behavior at last sexual intercourse. In both trials, family functioning was found to mediate the effects of condition on the outcomes. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) will be used to test: (H1) Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than Treatment as Usual in reducing illicit drug use over time; (H2) Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than Treatment as Usual in reducing unprotected sexual behavior use over time; and (H3) Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than Treatment as Usual in preventing subsequent criminal offenses. Additionally HLM will be used to determine whether (H1a) the effect of Familias Unidas on illicit drug use will be partially mediated by family functioning; (H2a) the effect of Familias Unidas on unprotected sexual behavior will be partially mediated by family functioning and (H3a) the effect of Familias Unidas on subsequent criminal offenses will be partially mediated by family functioning. The objective of the proposed study is to reduce illicit drug use and unsafe sexual behavior health disparities in Hispanic populations and particularly among youth in the juvenile justice system. The knowledge expected to be gained from this study will aid in the development of efficacious and effective interventions to reduce drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and HIV in Hispanic adolescents.",Preventing Drug Abuse and HIV in Hispanic First Offenders,7577066,R01DA025894,"['juvenile justice system ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' intervention effect ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Coitus ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Linear Models ', ' Parents ', ' Risk ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Knowledge ', ' System ', ' Participant ', ' criminal offender ', ' offender ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' post intervention ', ' Outcome ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2009,627410,0.13551991655777793
"Trajectories of Drugs Abuse in High Risk Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the Northwestern Juvenile Project to examine the dynamic relationships among patterns of drug use and disorder, risk and protective factors for drug use and disorder, and adult social role performance as juvenile justice youth age from adolescence to emerging adulthood and young adulthood. This study responds to NIDA's new initiatives on drug abuse, health disparities, and disproportionate minority confinement of African Americans. At year-end 2004, nearly 100,000 juveniles and nearly 2.1 million adults were incarcerated. African Americans comprise 12% of the US population but 40% of incarcerated populations. We are studying a racially/ethnically diverse sample (n=1709; 624 females, 1085 males) in Cook County (Chicago) Illinois, aged 10-18 years at recruitment (1995-1998). Youth are reinterviewed whether they are (re)incarcerated or back in the community. Our goal is to focus on gender differences, racial/ethnic disparities, and the effect of incarceration as we: (1) describe patterns of drug use and disorder --onset, persistence, desistence, and recurrence - as juvenile justice youth age from adolescence to emerging and young adulthood; (2) examine how risk and protective factors (e.g., comorbid mental disorders, adverse life events, availability of illicit drugs) predict, moderate, and mediate patterns of drug use and disorders; and (3) examine the dynamic relationships between patterns of drug use and disorder and adult social role performance (e.g., residential independence [including avoiding incarceration], employment, marriage, parenting, desistance from crime and violence). To analyze the longitudinal data, we will use summary statistics (e.g., prevalence rates, odds ratios), generalized linear mixed-effects models, survival analyses, and Muthen's recently developed extensions of growth mixture models. Extending the Northwestern Juvenile Project allows us to leverage the data already collected to examine the role of incarceration in the development of drug use and disorder, especially among African Americans; to identify risk and protective factors that are potentially malleable; to identify points of intervention at key developmental periods; and to extend theoretical models - developed in general population adolescents -- to correctional populations.           ",Trajectories of Drugs Abuse in High Risk Youth,7665138,R01DA019380,"['8-Azabicyclo(3.2.1)octane-2-carboxylic acid,

"Intensive Outpatient v. Outpatient Treatment with Buprenorphine among African Ame    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This application addresses broad Challenge Area (05): Comparative Effectiveness Research, and specific Challenge Topic (05-DA-104): Comparing Drug Treatment Effectiveness in Ethnic Minority Populations Background: Although there is relatively little difference in illicit drug use rates between African Americans and Whites, there is are significant differences in terms of the collateral impact of opiate use on these two communities and wide disparities in their access to treatment. Buprenorphine, a partial mu agonist approved for use the US in 2002 outside of strictly regulated opioid treatment programs, has the potential to reduce the disparity between demand for treatment and treatment access. However it appears from early data on the implementation of buprenorphine in the US that the health disparities faced by African Americans are now extending to this treatment. Indeed, according to SAMHSA over 90 percent of the patients receiving buprenorphine in their evaluation of this treatment were White. Many African Americans in urban areas are unable to find or afford the kind of buprenorphine physician office-based treatment that the approval of buprenorphine was intended to make possible. In Maryland and elsewhere, drug treatment agencies are responding to the disparities in access to buprenorphine treatment by offering grants or contracts to drug treatment programs that have traditionally relied exclusively on psychosocial approaches (""drug-free"" outpatient programs) to treatment. This arrangement has potential to ameliorate the access problem for African Americans, who in Baltimore make up about 80 percent of the city's heroin-using population. But this arrangement has also uncovered knowledge gaps that must be filled to enable both access and optimal patient centered treatment for this population. One such gap concerns what level of psychosocial treatment is appropriate for this population. Second, we need to understand how attitudes of staff at formerly abstinence-oriented programs affect the use of an opioid agonist in terms of retention in treatment and outcomes. Design: This two-group randomized clinical trial will test the effectiveness of intensive outpatient (IOP) v. standard outpatient (OP) treatment in 272 heroin-dependent African American adults receiving buprenorphine in 3 formerly ""drug-free"" programs. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment intensity conditions at intake and assessed at baseline, 3-, and 6-months post-baseline to determine treatment retention, frequency and severity of heroin and cocaine use, self-reported HIV-risk, quality of life, and to determine DSM-IV criteria for Full or Partial Remission of Opioid Dependence. Furthermore, patient factors potentially critical for treatment success (e.g., attitudes towards buprenorphine and average buprenorphine dose while in treatment) will be examined to determine their importance in influencing treatment outcomes. Moreover, both patient and staff attitudes and average buprenorphine dose will be evaluated to determine their respective relationships to treatment experiences and treatment retention. Significance, Innovation and Public Health Impact: This study is significant because it will examine the comparative effectiveness of two common counseling approaches offered with buprenorphine in clinics treating large numbers of African Americans, a population with significant need and limited access to this type of effective treatment. Study findings may help to expand the availability of buprenorphine to African Americans, inform providers and policymakers regarding the relative benefits of two levels of intensity of counseling, and inform the field regarding factors associated with optimal buprenorphine utilization and program retention. The use of the DSM-IV criteria for remission as a one of the outcome measures represents an important augmentation of the usual drug abuse research outcome measures, which usually rely primarily upon urine testing results and self-reports of drug use as the primary outcome measure and do not take into account drug- related reductions in clinically significant impairment or distress, despite some continued intermitted drug use. Public Health Statement This study will examine the comparative effectiveness of two common counseling approaches offered with buprenorphine in clinics treating large numbers of African Americans, a population with significant need and limited access to this type of effective treatment which reduces drug use and HIV-risk. Study findings may help to expand the availability of buprenorphine to African Americans, inform providers and policymakers regarding the relative benefits of two levels of intensity of counseling, and inform the field regarding factors associated with optimal buprenorphine utilization and program retention.               PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Statement This study will examine the comparative effectiveness of two common counseling approaches offered with buprenorphine in clinics treating large numbers of African Americans, a population with significant need and limited access to this type of effective treatment which reduces drug use and HIV-risk.

"Drug Policy, Incarceration, Community Re-entry, and Race Disparities in HIV/AIDS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a revision of an application submitted last year in response to PAR-07-379, ""Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Disparities."" We will analyze the interconnections between coercive mobility (the massive migration between the criminal justice [CJ] system and the community) produced by US drug policies and race disparities in HIV-related sexual risk among a sample of drug offenders in Connecticut (CT). Further, we will examine whether the association between coercive mobility (CM) and HIV-related sexual risk is affected by the degree of social disorganization in the communities in which these offenders reside. We also will study the feasibility of recruiting and following sexual partners of these individuals to better understand the impacts of CM on partners' HIV-related risk. We hypothesize that CM produces race disparities in HIV risk in a number of distinct ways: 1) Blacks are more likely than Whites to be incarcerated, so HIV-related sexual risk associated with CM can produce race disparities in HIV risk even if the effects of CM are the same for both Blacks and Whites; 2) Blacks are more likely than Whites to reside in communities experiencing the disorganizing impacts of CM, so to the extent that social disorganization exacerbates the effects of CM, it will affect the HIV risks of Blacks to a greater degree than Whites; 3) The sexual partners of Blacks are more likely to come from these same socially disorganized communities, furthering the negative impacts of CM for both returning inmates and their partners, and contributing to race disparities in HIV risk among women; and 4) Blacks are more likely to be penalized by drug policies in ways that increase their movement between prison/jail and the community and their vulnerability to its associated harms. We also hypothesize that we will be able to recruit and retain the sexual partners of study participants and conduct exploratory analyses of the impact of CM on their HIV-related sexual risk. An active Community Advisory Board including policymakers and program administrators will assist us in identifying structural interventions to reduce race disparities in HIV based on study findings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will examine the interconnections among drug policies in the US, coercive mobility (massive migration in and out of the criminal justice system), and race disparities in HIV-related sexual risk. It will suggest potential structural interventions for addressing the movement between prison/jail and the community, including drug policy reforms, with the potential to reduce race disparities in HIV/AIDS.           Narrative This research will examine the interconnections among drug policies in the US, coercive mobility (massive migration in and out of the criminal justice system), and race disparities in HIV-related sexual risk.

"Targeting HIV Risk Behaviors in Juvenile Drug Court-Involved Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overriding purpose of this study is to develop and test an intervention for reducing substance use and risky sexual behaviors among youth involved in juvenile drug court. Juvenile drug court provides an excellent setting in which to pursue the key study objectives by providing access to a well identified high risk population. Second, in addition to frequent judicial oversight, juvenile drug courts include several features that can enhance intervention effectiveness, sustainability, and potential for adoption. In addition, the fact that all juvenile drug courts have community-based treatment components and that such courts have been disseminated nationwide suggests the possibility of eventual widespread adoption if the proposed intervention is effective. The proposed intervention integrates evidence-based protocols for contingency management (CM) for substance abusing youth and family engagement strategies, with an evidence-informed family systems intervention for sexual risk originally developed to address substance use and sexual risk behaviors in HIV+ youth. These three interventions will be integrated into an efficient intervention that, if effective, can be amenable to adoption by juvenile drug courts. Following protocol development and beta testing, 160 drug court youth and their families will be randomized to the experimental intervention condition (HIV Risk Reduction or ""HRR"") versus Drug Court with Community Services (DC) conditions. Key outcomes will be assessed through 12-months post-baseline using a multi-method approach that will include assessment of substance use, risky sexual behaviors, criminal behavior, and participation in HIV counseling and testing services. Specific aims include: 1: Adapt existing intervention and training protocols into a single, efficient HRR intervention, beta test this HHR protocol with four youth in juvenile drug court and their families, and revise treatment and research protocols accordingly; 2: Conduct a randomized trial with 160 youth in juvenile drug court and their families to examine youth-level intervention effects (i.e., on substance use, sexual risk behavior, HIV counseling and testing, delinquent behavior) in comparison to DC through 12- months post referral and assess intervention fidelity. 3. If results suggest a positive HRR treatment effect, revise the intervention and training protocols in preparation for an effectiveness study and extended follow-up study. Importantly, the proposed study will (1) consider the multiple levels of influence on juvenile drug use, criminal justice involvement, and HIV risk behaviors, (2) integrate a drug abuse and HIV prevention intervention for youth in the criminal justice system with drug-related offenses, (3) address health disparities by targeting a primarily minority population of youth, and (4) increase referrals to HIV testing and counseling of drug court-involved youth. This study is designed to reduce HIV risk by addressing the potent interaction of drug use and risky sexual behaviors in drug court youth with evidence-based treatment components to maximize the likelihood of reversing these youths' adverse behavioral trajectories.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study is designed to gain knowledge about effective interventions for reducing HIV risk in a high risk population. Reducing HIV risk by effectively targeting substance use and risky sexual behaviors and by locating even a small number of HIV-positive youth could favorably impact society at multiple levels (individual, family, peer, community, fiscal).           PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is designed to gain knowledge about effective interventions for reducing HIV risk in a high risk population.

"The Center for the Study and Prevention of Drug Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This proposal for the Center for Study and Prevention of Drug Use is submitted by Morgan State University and seeks funding under the PAR-02-016 mechanism in response to the PA entitled ""Minority Institutions' Drug Abuse Research Development Program"" (MIDARP). The proposed Center will be an inter-institutional collaborative effort involving Morgan State University, a minority institution, and research intensive universities and programmatic initiatives that focus on and specialize in research on drug use and disparities associated with drug use. The Center seeks to build on the collaborative relationships established through the Center to increase the capacity of Morgan State, its faculty and its students to conduct rigorous drug use research with and emphasis on drug use epidemiology, public health, and health disparities related to drug use. In order to actualize the mission of the Center, four components were developed which address the necessary aspects of creating a drug use research center. 1) The Faculty Development Plan, which seeks to advance Morgan faculty by allowing them to engage in off-site collaborative research with individuals specializing in drug research. 2) A second aspect is the Student Development Plan, which seeks to expose, educate and, train minority students in the area of drug use research. 3) The research arm of the project includes a primary and four developmental pilot project, allowing researchers at Morgan to begin using their present expertise and investigating topics in the area of drug use and disparities related to drug use. 4) Overseeing, each of the areas is the proposed plan for the Administrative Units and Center Organization. Through this component collaborative relationships, research projects, and faculty and student development will be monitored and enhanced. As a result of the Center faculty at Morgan State will be further enhanced regarding their ability to conduct rigorous research independently, specifically submitting R01's. Further, Morgan will be sufficiently capable of training students for careers in drug use research by developing a structured program in drug research, and the administrative staff will have the skills necessary to support the research staff in all endeavors related to research projects.

"Public Housing Relocations: Impact on Healthcare Access, Drug Use & Sexual Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A rapidly unfolding intervention in Atlanta provides a rare opportunity to advance health services research for a vulnerable population: poor Black drug users. The Atlanta Housing Authority (AHA) is relocating all 5,000 residents of seven concentrated public housing communities to homes spread across Atlanta. Past research indicates that relocates tend to move to census tracts that have markedly better socioeconomic and healthcare environments than their original tracts; however, their social networks and support systems shrink after they move. The AHA relocations thus offer a rare opportunity to deepen scientific knowledge about the ways in which neighborhood, network, and social support factors shape Black drug users' healthcare access and health. Mining this opportunity will advance several NIDA priority areas, but is predicated on rapid funding of this project: three AHA communities (the ""BBT"" communities) have already begun the relocation process, and four others (the ""HHRP"" communities, which include Herndon Homes, Hollywood Court, Roosevelt, and Palmer) will begin to relocate in 2009. Traditional NIH funding cycles are too slow to realize the opportunities presented by the AHA relocations. While we presently have funds to gather pre-relocation data on 150 BBT residents, this sample size is insufficient to explore multilevel hypotheses. A team of two new investigators with a history of collaboration is thus seeking Time Sensitive R21 funds to achieve the following aims: (1) For 200 Black drug-using residents of the four HHRP communities, describe pre-relocation neighborhood, network, and social support characteristics (e.g., spatial access to drug treatment, drug network size, recovery support), and residents' (a) access to and retention in drug treatment, and primary care access; (b) drug use patterns; and (c) sexual risk and sexually transmitted infection (STI) status. We will integrate spatial, survey, and biological data to achieve Aim 1. (2) For 100 ex-residents of the two communities that will relocate first (Herndon Homes and Hollywood Court), assess participants' post-relocation status on the variables listed in Aim 1, and pre-/post-relocation changes in these variables. (3) For the total sample of 350 residents of the HHRP and BBT communities, conduct exploratory cross-sectional analyses of pre-relocation relationships between neighborhoods, network and social support characteristics and participants' (a) access to and retention in drug treatment, and access to primary care; (b) drug use patterns; and (c) sexual risk behaviors and STI infection status. We will also initiate preliminary analyses of the 100 Herndon Homes and Hollywood Court participants' pre-/post-relocation data to explore how changes in exposures relate to changes in outcomes. We will seek R01 funds to conduct a longitudinal study of the 350-member cohort that will test hypotheses generated by the R21. This longitudinal R01 study will establish the direction of relationships identified in the R21 in a sample of sufficient size to draw firm statistical conclusions about topics of major scientific import to NIDA.           Project Narrative The proposed R21 study will advance scientific knowledge in several NIDA priority areas that pertain to racial/ethnic disparities in health service access and health: (1) We will study health service and health outcomes that disproportionately affect poor, Black drug users, namely suboptimal access to, and retention in, drug treatment and poor primary care access; harmful drug use patterns; and HIV/STI sexual risk and STI infections. (2) We are seeking the causes of these outcomes in Black drug users' neighborhoods, networks, and social support systems, thereby expanding the traditional etiologic frame beyond individual-level exposures, and exploring the pathways linking these exposures and outcomes. (3) Our analytic plan will allow us to distinguish the impacts of individual-level processes from those of neighborhood-level processes, a distinction that ecologic analyses alone cannot capture.

"Service Use, ATI Program Outcomes, and Pro-Social Change This application details a proposal for a prospective longitudinal panel study with a random sample of 360 individuals attending alternative to incarceration (ATI) programs in New York City (NYC) that serve drug- involved offenders. The proposed study focuses on (1) the impact of utilization of formal healthcare and psychosocial services on outcomes of ATI program completion, recidivism, technical violations (i.e., law- breaking behaviors not resulting in re-incarceration), and pro-social change (e.g., fulfilling child- and elder- caretaking roles); and (2) factors affecting service utilization among ATI program participants. The study fulfills several recommendations from the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Health Service Research at NIDA, including broadening both (a) the venues of drug abuse services researchto include programs in ""nontraditional"" settings, especially the criminal justice system, and (b) the range of needs and characteristics of subgroups that are studied in order to address a fuller ""continuum of care and patient groups."" The Task Force's recommendations echoed other calls regarding the need to elucidate mediators of success of treatment, especially those in nontraditional settings such as criminal justice programs for drug-involved offenders.Also consistent with the Task Force report, the proposed research will employ new data analysis methods for causal inference using observational data. The significance and feasibility of the proposed study are substantiated by findings from a pilot study successfully completed by the investigators. For the proposed study, we will recruit individuals at the start of their participation in ATI programs designed for adult, drug-involved offenders in NYC, conducting structured interviews every 3 months over the course of 18 months for each participant. Aims, hypotheses, and measurements are guided by the Network Episode Model, an innovative model that conceptualizes access and attendance of formal services as a time-varying behavior driven by level of need and shaped by dynamic processes involving individual/social context factors and service system experiences. The proposed study is designed to achieve the following primary aims: (1) To examine the causal relationship between service utilization and (a) ATI program completion, (b) recidivism, (c) technical violations, and (d) pro-social change; and (2) To identify and estimate the causal impact of factors that influence access and utilization of formal services among ATI participants. Findings will generate substantive and practical implications for researchers and professionals in the areas of drug abuse, services research, criminal justice, and public health in developing and testing future interventions and programs for drug-involved offenders. The proposed study will be conducted by Dr. Elwin Wu and Dr. Nabila EI-Bassel of the Social Intervention Group at the Columbia University School of Social Work.

"Drug Use, Disorder & HIV/AIDS Risk in Juvenile Justice Youth:A Longitudinal Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the Northwestern Juvenile Project to examine the developmental patterns of drug use and disorder and risk for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as juvenile justice youth age from adolescence to emerging adulthood and young adulthood. This study responds to NIDA's new initiatives in health disparities in HIV/AIDS in minority populations, specifically the nexus of drug abuse, criminal justice involvement, and HIV/AIDS among African Americans.  African Americans comprise 12% of the US population but 40% of incarcerated populations and 50% of new cases of HIV/AIDS. At year-end 2004, nearly 100,000 juveniles and nearly 2.1 million adults were incarcerated. We will continue to study a racially/ethnically diverse sample (n=758; 330 females, 428 males; 412 African Americans, 137 non-Hispanic whites, 207 Hispanics, 2 other race/ethnicity) of persons who were arrested and detained in Cook County (Chicago) Illinois, aged 10-18 years at recruitment (1997-1998). Since recruitment, data have been collected on the development of substance use and disorders, risk and protective factors, and HIV/AIDS risk behaviors. Participants are re-interviewed whether they are (re)incarcerated or back in the community. We propose to conduct annual interviews 10, 11, 12, and 13 years post-baseline, collect records, and test for HIV infection and selected STIs. Focusing on racial/ethnic disparities, gender and age differences, and effects of incarceration, we will: (1) describe patterns of drug use and disorder - onset, persistence, desistence, and recurrence -- as juvenile justice youth age from adolescence to emerging adulthood and young adulthood; (2) describe patterns of HIV/AIDS risk behaviors during this same period; (3) describe the prevalence and incidence of HIV infection and other STIs; and (4) examine the relationship between drug use and disorder and HIV/AIDS risk behaviors. Extending the Northwestern Juvenile Project allows us to leverage the data already collected to examine health disparities and the role of disproportionate minority confinement in the development of drug use and disorder and HIV/AIDS risk; to identify risk and protective factors that are potentially malleable; to identify points of intervention at key developmental periods; and to extend theoretical models - developed in general population adolescents - to correctional populations.           ","Drug Use, Disorder & HIV/AIDS Risk in Juvenile Justice Youth:A Longitudinal

"PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative (MARI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The proposed study's overarching goal is to reduce the ethnic disparities in HIV infection between Hispanic and non-Hispanic youth living in Miami-Dade County, an HIV epicenter. This goal will be accomplished by two aims: AIM 1 is to develop and manualize a one-and-a-half- month streamlined version of an efficacious HIV preventive intervention entitled Familias Unidas; and AIM II is to evaluate the efficacy of the streamlined version of Familias Unidas plus an HIV Prevention School CurriculumTreatment as Usual, relative to the HIV Prevention School Curriculum Treatment as Usual only, in preventing drug use and unprotected sexual behavior, two risk factors for HIV infection. Familias Unidas aims to prevent drug use and unprotected sexual behavior by (a) increasing family functioning, (b) increasing parental monitoring of peer activities, and (c) influencing adolescent social cognitive mechanisms regarding drug use and unsafe sexual behavior. A sample of 240 Hispanic 9th grade adolescents and their primary caregivers will be randomized to one of two conditions: Familias Unidas plus the HIV School Curriculum Treatment as Usual (hereafter refererred to as Familias Unidas) or the HIV Prevention School Curriculum Treatment as Usual only. Two studies have demonstrated the efficacy of an intensive, 9 to 12 month version of Familias Unidas. In the first study, Familias Unidas was shown to be efficacious relative to a no- intervention control condition in increasing family functioning. In the second study, Familias Unidas was found to be efficacious in preventing drug use and unsafe sexual behavior relative to two attention control conditions. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) will be used to test: (H1) Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than the HIV Prevention School Curriculum Treatment as Usual in preventing adolescent drug use over time and (H2) Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than the HIV Prevention School Curriculum Treatment as Usual in preventing adolescent unprotected sexual behavior over time. Additionally HLM will be used to determine whether (H1a) the effect of Familias Unidas on drug use will be partially mediated by (1) family functioning; (2) parental monitoring of peers; and (3) social cognitive mechanisms regarding drug use; and (H2a) the effect of Familias Unidas on unprotected sexual behavior will be partially mediated by (1) family functioning; (2) parental monitoring of peers; (3) social cognitive mechanisms regarding unprotected sex; and (4) drug use. The objective of the proposed study is to reduce HIV contraction health disparities in Hispanic populations. The knowledge expected to be gained from this study will aid in the development of interventions to reduce drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and HIV in Hispanic adolescents.           ","PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative (MARI)",7683175,U01PS000671,[''],NCHHSTP,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2009,272956,0.10409011619734354
"Navigator Enhanced Case Management for Jail Inmates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year, there are over 600 unduplicated HIV-infected persons incarcerated in the San Francisco jail and almost two-thirds released with HIV-focused discharge planning were reincarcerated within 1 year. More than half of HIV-infected jail inmates are diagnosed with mental health conditions severe enough to require medication and a similar proportion report substance abuse disorders at the time of detention. While some community-based services exist, there remains a critical need exists to improve linkages to care and adherence to care plans for HIV-infected adults as they move between community and jai. An effective service delivery model used in similar high-needs populations exists, but has not been tested with HIV-infected drug users leaving jails - Navigator case management. Base on harm reduction, motivational interviewing and general social work principles, this model uses assertive community treatment and a highly proactive approach to facilitate adherence to a comprehensive care plan designed to address a client's multiple needs. Case managers work with paraprofessional peer navigators to help clients make better use of available resources, more effectively communicate with providers, sustain care over time and successfully connect with multiple service provider sectors. In this study, we propose to tailor this approach to meet the needs of HIV-infected individuals with substance abuse and mental health issues, pilot test the intervention and assessment procedures and then conduct a randomized study in which 360 HIV-infected men and women leaving jail. Specifically, participants will receive either Navigator case management delivered by the non-profit San Francisco Pre-Trial Diversion project or the standard of care currently provided to transitioning inmates, 90- days of as-needed case management provided by the San Francisco Department of Public Health's Forensic AIDS Project. We will test the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing sexual and drug-related HIV transmission risk, increasing HIV medication adherence, reducing drug dependence and reducing reincarceration. Finally, we will characterize both the Navigator and Forensic AIDS Project intervention processes and conduct exploratory analyses of the mediators of HIV transmission risk and risk reduction and HIV-related adherence among HIV+ individuals leaving jail. Our study is highly innovative because no interventions exist that are proven effective with this population - HIV-infected individuals with drug use and mental health issues. This study will also contribute to the field of HIV prevention by incorporating risk reduction counseling alongside more traditional case management support services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-infected adults incarcerated in the United States criminal justice system are predominantly active drug users and disproportionately people of color. The complex interplay of poverty, race, lack of education and sanctions--rather than treatment--for addictions reinforces returns to the criminal justice system and pervasive health disparities for HIV-infected individuals. Underlying behaviors that lead to repeated incarceration closely correlate with behaviors that are associated with HIV transmission and increased morbidity and mortality from HIV. In drug addicted adults, recidivism is driven by drug relapse and illegal activities associated with drug use, failure to engage and remain in mental health treatment or failure to break free from social instability in the form of homelessness and joblessness. This study proposes to assess whether a method of case management proven effective for similar populations can ensuring services to successfully and permanently break the cycle of incarceration, drug abuse and HIV transmission risk behavior among HIV-infected individuals leaving jail.              NARRATIVE HIV-infected adults incarcerated in the United States criminal justice system are predominantly active drug users and disproportionately people of color.

"Stress and Drug Use Vulnerability in Rural African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The impact that drug addictions have on health disparities impacting at-risk African Americans who reside in the rural South are grossly understudied. While there is strong evidence linking drug use and abuse to violent behaviors, injuries, mental health, and physical health problems, it is unclear how African Americans are disproportionately at risk given their relatively low incidence rates of drug use and abuse. There is a growing body of literature linking stress and the subsequent activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to addictions. Given the considerable heterogeneity within drug-related phenotypes and limited evidence of large-magnitude single gene influences, stress dysregulation will be investigated as an endophenotype for clarifying the more subtle relationship between specific genes and drug use vulnerability. This study will pursue two specific aims using innovative experimental methodologies from drug abuse, molecular genetics, endocrinology, social psychology, and cross-cultural research: (1) Investigate whether genotype interacts with environmental variables (GxE) to affect physiological responses to acute stress; and (2) Investigate whether stress dysregulation predicts drug related attitudes, craving, and history of drug use. Acute stress will be elicited via the Trier Social Stress Test. Subjects (N = 100) will be randomly assigned into one of two speech tasks: (a) shoplifting or (b) experience of discrimination. Measured variables will include genotype (CRH and CRHR1), hormones (cortisol and DHEA), autonomic measures (galvanic skin conductance and heart rate variability), chronic environmental stressors, implicit drug-related cognitions, drug craving, and drug use history. It is envisioned that this proposed study can initiate a multidisciplinary program of research aimed at investigating gene by environment (GxE) influences on drug use vulnerability. Empirical research in this area is needed in order to gain insight into the biopsychosocial risk factors that have the capacity to inform theory, research, prevention, and treatment in the area of drug addictions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American drug use and abuse behaviors are often characterized by oversimplified models that are rooted in research studies that rarely include them. This proposal seeks to take a multidimensional approach (e.g., genetics, endocrinology, psychology, culture, social environment) towards investigating mechanisms that may increase drug use vulnerability in at-risk African American adults who reside in the rural South. Such research is needed in order to inform theory, research, prevention, and intervention efforts aimed at elimination health disparities that disproportionately impact this community.           PROJECT NARRATIVE African American drug use and abuse behaviors are often characterized by oversimplified models that are rooted in research studies that rarely include them.

"In-home prevention of SA risks for Native teen families    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this Competitive Revision [Notice Number (NOT-OD-09-058) and Notice Title (""NIH Announces the Availability of Recovery Act Funds for Competitive Revision Applications"")] is to expand the scope of our current grant, ""In-Home Prevention of Substance Abuse Risks for Native Teen Families,"" (NIDA 5R01DA019042; FOA: PA-07-070) that is assessing the efficacy of the ""Family Spirit"" (FS) prenatal and early childhood home- visiting intervention delivered by American Indian (AI) paraprofessionals to AI teen mothers and their children. The current FS intervention is designed to promote mothers' effective parenting practices, reduce maternal drug use, and improve maternal and child outcomes associated with lifetime drug use. The Revision will research current drug use patterns and parenting practices of men who fathered a child with and/or are male partners of AI teen mothers enrolled in the current trial and work with communities to design a data-driven, culturally informed FS supplemental intervention for fathers. Specific aims are to: 1) describe drug use patterns of AI fathers/male partners; 2) explore fathers' and community stakeholders' beliefs and motivations regarding drug use and fatherhood; 3) examine relationships between fathers' drug use patterns and fathering practices; and 4) design a FS fathers curriculum targeting: a) drug refusal and avoidance; b) effective parenting; c) job readiness, and d) improved home environments. At the time of submission of this Competitive Revision, the sample for the current grant (N=322 mother/child pairs) is recruited and randomized to the FS Intervention + Optimized Standard Care vs. Optimized Standard Care alone. At baseline, expectant AI teen mothers at ~32 weeks gestation from four southwestern reservation communities were 12-19 years old and reported high rates of lifetime drug use. This study aims to recruit 120 fathers (30 from each site) evenly distributed across treatment and control groups and 40 community experts (10 from each site) to advise the intervention development process. Research methods will combine in-depth qualitative research processes with state-of-the-art ACASI technologies to maximize data quality and accelerate transmittal, analysis, and dissemination of findings. Long-term expected outcomes are to reduce persistent AI behavioral health disparities related to drug use over the life course of young AI parents and their offspring.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Given American Indian males' known risks for drug use and their impact on partners and children's drug-related outcomes, there is an urgent need to identify effective intervention strategies for young American Indian fathers. First-time fatherhood may provide a pivotal developmental time point for behavioral redirection and decrease related behavioral risks for partners/spouses and children.              Project Narrative (Relevance) Given American Indian males' known risks for drug use and their impact on partners and children's drug-related outcomes, there is an urgent need to identify effective intervention strategies for young American Indian fathers.

"Collaborative Research on Drug Abuse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This P01 develops and applies state-of-the-art methods to analyze existing but under-utilized drug abuse databases in collaboration with their owners. We address contemporary, theoretical, and applied issues in drug abuse research to understand intersections between substance abuse and AIDS risk behaviors as well as minority and gender-based health disparities. We work with dozens of investigators from drug & social policy, epidemiology, health sciences, medicine, nursing, psychiatry, psychology, public health, and social work who own exciting substance abuse data to develop models that test current theories, especially on epidemiology, prevention, intervention, and treatment of drug abuse, using modern multivariate methods to control for measurement errors, biases, and other confounds. The Models and Methods Project develops psychometric and statistical analytic techniques that hold special promise for improving the quality of drug abuse and AIDS research. The At-Risk Project studies substance abuse related data sets on vulnerable populations (substance abusers, homeless people, individuals who are HIV positive or who have AIDS, victims of domestic abuse, runaways, gang members, and others at high risk for AIDS or drug abuse) with methods to control sampling, measurement, distributional and other biases. The Community Project studies drug abuse etiology, adult consequences, HIV risk, intergenerational processes, general deviance, and related issues in large community-based samples, and develops and tests explanatory theories using models that permit separation of common from specific effects, control for artifacts, etc. The Core Project oversees and integrates all components, hosts visiting scholars, provides computer facilities, and sponsors a mentoring program for disadvantaged students. The substantive part of the Models Project and the At-Risk and Community Projects will be developing and testing integrative theories that can be applied across different populations. The findings from their studies will lead to greater understanding of precursors and concomitants of substance abuse and HIV/AIDS risk and transmission. In turn, these findings will guide development of effective interventions to reduce negative health outcomes and treatment disparities in community, ethnic, and vulnerable populations, and provide guidance on how these may be alleviated.      PROGRAM CHARACTERISTICS          ",Collaborative Research on Drug Abuse,7687376,P01DA001070,[''],NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P01,2009,1094325,0.06373110537308126
"Drug Abuse and Crime Across the Life Course in an African American Population    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans are disproportionately represented in national crime statistics for arrests and incarceration as well as victimization, particularly for drug-related and violent offenses. Their involvement in crime often represents only one component of a well-recognized cluster of negative experiences and circumstances including drug use problems, socioeconomic disadvantage and poor physical and mental health, sometimes evident in childhood. The cost to individuals, families, and society is enormous, yet we know little about the development of these patterns across the life course. Despite these evident disparities, few studies have examined the development of drug use and criminal behaviors over time within African American community populations, especially into mid adulthood. We intend to study the timing and sources of risk over the life span to better understand the disparities in health and social consequences related to criminal justice issues among African Americans. To that end, we request support to analyze existing crime and drug data covering 35 years in the lives of a cohort of first grade, African American children from inner city Chicago. This prospective developmental study (the Woodlawn project) began in 1966-67, with the most recent follow up in 2002-3 at ages 42-43, and interim assessments in adolescence and early adulthood (age 32-33). The study population had high levels of drug use and criminal activity in adulthood. In the proposed project, we will focus on interrelationships of drug abuse and crime, examining predictors and consequences of drug abuse, criminal activity, and involvement with the criminal justice system. Using data from cohort members, mothers, interviewers, and official criminal records, we will identify 1) patterns of drug use and criminal behaviors over the life course; 2) individual and contextual predictors of later drug use, criminal activity/behaviors, and involvement with the criminal justice system; 3) social, economic, and health consequences of drug use, criminal behaviors, and involvement in the criminal justice system. Of particular interest is how drug use in adolescence and early adulthood relates to the risk of being arrested and incarcerated and, conversely, how early arrests and incarceration influence later drug use and criminal behaviors. This information will further our understanding of the etiology and consequences of crime and drug use into mid adulthood, and inform the design of interventions at various stages along the life course.             ",Drug Abuse and Crime Across the Life Course in an African American Population,7586197,R01DA022366,"['Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Female ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' criminal behavior ', ' Health ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Interviewer ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Individual ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mothers ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Staging ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societies ', ' Life ', ' Victimization ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Woman ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Behavior ', ' interest ', ' 1st grade ', ' first grade ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' social integration ', ' cohort ', ' intervention program ', ' member ', ' Population Study ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Chicago ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' abstracting ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Sampling ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' Social Functioning ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' ']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,466759,0.19747166288874865
"Trajectories of Drugs Abuse in High Risk Youth We propose to extend the Northwestern Juvenile Project to examine the dynamic relationships among patterns of drug use and disorder, risk and protective factors for drug use and disorder, and adult social role performance as juvenile justice youth age from adolescence to emerging adulthood and young adulthood. This study responds to NIDA's new initiatives on drug abuse, health disparities, and disproportionate minority confinement of African Americans. At year-end 2004, nearly 100,000 juveniles and nearly 2.1 million adults were incarcerated. African Americans comprise 12% of the US population but 40% of incarcerated populations. We are studying a racially/ethnically diverse sample (n=1709; 624 females, 1085 males) in Cook County (Chicago) Illinois, aged 10-18 years at recruitment (1995-1998). Youth are reinterviewed whether they are (re)incarcerated or back in the community. Our goal is to focus on gender differences, racial/ethnic disparities, and the effect of incarceration as we: (1) describe patterns of drug use and disorder --onset, persistence, desistence, andrecurrence - asjuvenile justice youth agefrom adolescence to emerging and young adulthood; (2) examine how risk and protective factors (e.g., comorbid mental disorders, adverse life events, availability of illicit drugs) predict, moderate, and mediate patterns of drug use and disorders; and (3) examine the dynamic relationships between patterns of drug use and disorder and adult social role performance (e.g., residential independence [including avoiding incarceration], employment, marriage, parenting, desistance from crime and violence). To analyze the longitudinal data, we will use summary statistics (e.g., prevalence rates, odds ratios), generalized linear mixed-effects models, survival analyses, and Muthen's recently developed extensions of growth mixture models. Extending the Northwestern Juvenile Project allows us to leverage the data already collected to examine the role of incarceration in the development of drug use and disorder, especially among African Americans; to identify risk and protective factors that are potentially malleable; to identify points of intervention at key developmental periods; and to extend theoretical models developed in general population adolescents -- to correctional populations.

"Development of Behavioral and Social Interventions that Reduce Stigma and Improve    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application addresses the broad Challenge Area (01) Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention and the specific Challenge Topic, 01-DA-106: Development of behavioral and social interventions that reduce stigma and improve quality and accessibility of health care services in low resource settings. We will evaluate a pharmacy-based pilot intervention that combines rapid HIV testing with other preventive screening services including blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol screening. This pilot targeted to injection drug users (IDUs) who purchase syringes from pharmacies via the New York State Expanded Syringe Access Program (ESAP) - a program aimed at increasing sterile syringe access to help reduce HIV transmission. By combining HIV testing with less stigmatizing screening services and offering testing to all pharmacy patrons instead of singling out drug users, the likelihood of reducing HIV testing and drug use-associated stigma will increase. Although HIV testing is increasingly accessible and new testing technologies are available, HIV testing rates are low in the black and Hispanic community, especially among IDUs at risk for HIV and many other infectious and chronic diseases. Structural barriers (i.e., lack of health insurance) in the black and Hispanic community, especially among IDUs may limit access to regular health care/ preventive services. Access barriers are compounded by stigma associated with getting an HIV test that may identify an individual as a drug user and/or someone who engages in socially unacceptable behavior. Thus, this proposed study aims to 1) qualitatively evaluate HIV testing and chronic disease screening in pharmacies, 2) compare/contrast correlates of agreeing to a HIV test vs. not among IDU syringe customers and their peers and 3) qualitatively compare/contrast HIV testing with comprehensive screening services pharmacy (intervention) vs. HIV testing only pharmacy (control). To accomplish these aims, we propose to conduct in-depth interviews among key stakeholders to inform development of study materials, IDU/peer survey and pharmacy staff surveys. We will recruit 2 ESAP-registered Harlem pharmacies (1 intervention and 1 control) where our current work has developed the infrastructure to perform on-site screening services. Among the intervention and control pharmacies, 798 (518 non-drug using, 70 drug-using +3 networks/ drug user) pharmacy customers will be recruited. We will adapt a previously developed training module to train pharmacy personnel on how to engage pharmacy customers. Customers from the intervention pharmacy will complete a brief attitude scale on attitudes toward HIV, IDUs and stigma, watch an educational video on the importance of health screening (particularly HIV testing), participate in desired screening services and undergo a structured 20-minute ACASI that repeats the attitudes scale. Customers in the control pharmacy will only undergo HIV testing and a structured 20-minute ACASI survey. Semi-structured surveys will be administered to all pharmacy staff to ascertain impact of on-site prevention services on pharmacy personnel and business flow. We will use standard qualitative analytic techniques and GEE to account for clustering in quantitative analyses. The proposed research is highly significant in that it aims to explore a pilot intervention that involves expanding pharmacy services to include HIV testing and to determine if offering HIV testing within a comprehensive prevention approach that includes less stigmatizing screening tests (i.e., blood pressure, glucose and cholesterol screening) increases HIV testing among injection drug users who purchase syringes in pharmacies and their peers (drug-using and/or non-drug using). We will be using new HIV testing technologies and bringing technological innovations and treatment modalities to low-income communities in New York City. If successful, this model can be duplicated not only throughout other high-risk neighborhoods in New York, but in several other cities and states. If our findings are positive, broader public health impact could follow. Pharmacists can partner with clinicians and other health care providers to offer an integrative approach to HIV testing to high-risk injection drug using populations and to other groups with limited access to health care services such as the uninsured and undocumented immigrants. Adoption of this integrative approach to HIV testing on a larger scale could also be implemented and reduce many of the access and stigmatization barriers experienced in marginalized populations for HIV testing while simultaneously increasing and improving general health and well-being by targeting chronic disease outcomes that disproportionately affect marginalized populations.               NARRATIVE The proposed research is highly significant in that it aims to explore a pilot intervention that involves expanding pharmacy services to include HIV testing and to determine if offering HIV testing within a comprehensive prevention approach that includes less stigmatizing screening tests (i.e., blood pressure, glucose and cholesterol screening) increases HIV testing among injection drug users who purchase syringes in pharmacies and their peers (drug-using and/or non-drug using).

"DIDARP at the University of Puerto Rico School of Public Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to enhance our capacity to conduct drug abuse research with criminal justice populations from a public health perspective, at the University of Puerto Rico, Graduate School of Public Health. Our research development strategy centers on developing proficiency in research competencies in a critical mass of faculty that will cohesively pursue epidemiological and health services research relevant to engaging and retaining in community drug treatment re-entering inmates with histories of a substance use disorder. The program will provide as well opportunities to develop research capacity in students at different stages in their education and to encourage them to engage in drug abuse research careers. The research projects submitted with this application will explore individual and drug treatment provider factors that may predict entry and retention in community drug treatment for re-entering ex-offenders with a substance use problem. The proposed projects should contribute to address the disproportionate prevalence of untreated substance use problems in incarcerated populations as well as the large proportion of untreated ex-offenders that become re-addicted and who are re-incarcerated shortly after release The research projects include three pilot and one developmental project that address NIDA research priorities such as the services needs of special populations and studies of service providers. We expect MIDARP support to enhance our capacity to engage in NIH funded drug abuse research of relevance to addressing disparities borne by Latinos with a substance use disorder. To reach our goal, we have established the following aims: 1) Provide leadership, support, and coordination to increase the number of Latino faculty and students capable of successfully conducting drug abuse research relevant to a criminal justice context. 2) Enhance institutional and extra- institutional resources that sustain the successful planning, financing, and conduct of drug abuse research. 3) Disseminate research findings in a timely and effective fashion to the research community, to the academic programs, and to other stakeholders involved in addressing the drug treatment needs of ex- offenders with a substance use problem.

"Social networks and HIV risk among rural drug users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is in response to PA-06-478, ""Research on Rural Mental Health and Drug Abuse Disorders"". One of the research areas highlighted by this PA is the examination of rural HIV transmission using social network analysis. The overall goal of the study is to examine the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors for HIV and other blood borne infections (BBIs) such as hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) among rural Appalachian drug users using social network analysis and multilevel modeling. HIV continues to be a major public health problem in the United States, especially among drug users. However, little is known about HIV in rural areas in which there are marked health disparities. Therefore, given that studies among urban drug users have found that social network indicators are robust predictors of HIV risk, both social network and individual characteristics will be measured for their association with HIV risk among rural drug users. The specific aims are: 1) To determine the prevalence and incidence of HIV, HCV and HBV among rural injection and non- injection drug users; 2) To examine HIV and other BBI risk among rural injection and non-injection drug users; and 3) To examine longitudinal changes in rural HIV, HCV and HBV risk at 6-months, 12-months and 18- months post-baseline. To meet these aims, a sample 500 rural injection and non-injection drug users will be recruited using respondent driven sampling (RDS). In addition to biologic testing for HIV, HCV and HBV, rural participants will be given an interviewer-administered questionnaire pertaining to their social networks (drug, sexual and support networks), sociodemographics, drug use, HIV risk behaviors, psychiatric diagnoses, intravention and norms. Since individuals will be nested within networks, data will be analyzed using multilevel random effects regression that allows for the simultaneous examination of social network and individual-level risk. Consistent with the priorities of the NIDA AIDS Research Program, this proposal will explore the social network structure in a rural drug using population in order to better understand how network factors may affect HIV risk in rural areas using an innovative multilevel approach. Results from the proposed study will inform the design and implementation of HIV interventions in rural areas and help to determine the appropriate population for which to target such activities in order to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV and other BBIs.       Although HIV remains a significant public health problem in the United States, especially among drug users, little is known about HIV risk in rural areas such as Appalachia. It has been shown in urban populations that relationships among drug users, also known as social networks, are important predictors of HIV risk. Therefore, this study seeks to characterize rural HIV risk by measuring both social network and individual behaviors in order to inform prevention activities in health resource-deprived rural areas.          ",Social networks and HIV risk among rural drug users,7603045,R01DA024598,"['health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Social Network ', ' Data ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Affect ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health Resources ', ' Hepatitis B ', ' serum hepatitis ', ' infection with hepatitis B virus ', ' infection with HBV ', ' Viral Hepatitis B ', ' Hepatitis B Infection ', ' Hepatitis B Virus ', ' Homologous Serum Hepatitis Virus ', ' HBV ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non-A non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non A non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis nonA nonB ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' PT-NANBH ', ' Non-B Hepatitis Parenterally-Transmitted Non-A ', ' NANBH ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Area ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Injections ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Interviewer ', ' Interview ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' HCV ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' Kentucky ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Respondent ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug user ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Questionnaires ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rural Population ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' serology ', ' Serological Tests ', ' Serologic tests ', ' Individual Adjustment ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Urban Population ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Behavior ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' meetings ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Seroprevalences ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Measures ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Communities ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2009,607327,0.12666251430322556
"Brief Strategic Family Therapy versus Treatment as Usual: Extended Follow-up for    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal this project is to examine the long-term effects of outpatient treatments for illicit drug using adolescents. Specifically, this study proposes to complete a follow-up assessment with a sample of 379 young adults that participated in a recently completed effectiveness trial to examine the differential effectiveness of brief strategic family therapy (BSFT) and treatment as usual (TAU) in the rates of substance use, externalizing behaviors (including arrests and sexually risky behaviors), time in restricted settings (e.g., residential treatment, detention), and improvements in family functioning.

This goal will be accomplished by two aims: AIM 1 is to develop and manualize a one-and-a-half- month streamlined version of an efficacious HIV preventive intervention entitled Familias Unidas; and AIM II is to evaluate the efficacy of the streamlined version of Familias Unidas plus an HIV Prevention School CurriculumTreatment as Usual, relative to the HIV Prevention School Curriculum Treatment as Usual only, in preventing drug use and unprotected sexual behavior, two risk factors for HIV infection. Familias Unidas aims to prevent drug use and unprotected sexual behavior by (a) increasing family functioning, (b) increasing parental monitoring of peer activities, and (c) influencing adolescent social cognitive mechanisms regarding drug use and unsafe sexual behavior. A sample of 240 Hispanic 9th grade adolescents and their primary caregivers will be randomized to one of two conditions: Familias Unidas plus the HIV School Curriculum Treatment as Usual (hereafter refererred to as Familias Unidas) or the HIV Prevention School Curriculum Treatment as Usual only. Two studies have demonstrated the efficacy of an intensive, 9 to 12 month version of Familias Unidas. In the first study, Familias Unidas was shown to be efficacious relative to a no- intervention control condition in increasing family functioning. In the second study, Familias Unidas was found to be efficacious in preventing drug use and unsafe sexual behavior relative to two attention control conditions. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) will be used to test: (H1) Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than the HIV Prevention School Curriculum Treatment as Usual in preventing adolescent drug use over time and (H2) Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than the HIV Prevention School Curriculum Treatment as Usual in preventing adolescent unprotected sexual behavior over time. Additionally HLM will be used to determine whether (H1a) the effect of Familias Unidas on drug use will be partially mediated by (1) family functioning; (2) parental monitoring of peers; and (3) social cognitive mechanisms regarding drug use; and (H2a) the effect of Familias Unidas on unprotected sexual behavior will be partially mediated by (1) family functioning; (2) parental monitoring of peers; (3) social cognitive mechanisms regarding unprotected sex; and (4) drug use. The objective of the proposed study is to reduce HIV contraction health disparities in Hispanic populations. The knowledge expected to be gained from this study will aid in the development of interventions to reduce drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and HIV in Hispanic adolescents.           ","PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative (MARI)",7922504,U01PS000671,[''],NCHHSTP,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2010,306816,0.10409011619734354
"Drug Use, Disorder & HIV/AIDS Risk in Juvenile Justice Youth:A Longitudinal Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the Northwestern Juvenile Project to examine the developmental patterns of drug use and disorder and risk for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as juvenile justice youth age from adolescence to emerging adulthood and young adulthood. This study responds to NIDA's new initiatives in health disparities in HIV/AIDS in minority populations, specifically the nexus of drug abuse, criminal justice involvement, and HIV/AIDS among African Americans.  African Americans comprise 12% of the US population but 40% of incarcerated populations and 50% of new cases of HIV/AIDS. At year-end 2004, nearly 100,000 juveniles and nearly 2.1 million adults were incarcerated. We will continue to study a racially/ethnically diverse sample (n=758; 330 females, 428 males; 412 African Americans, 137 non-Hispanic whites, 207 Hispanics, 2 other race/ethnicity) of persons who were arrested and detained in Cook County (Chicago) Illinois, aged 10-18 years at recruitment (1997-1998). Since recruitment, data have been collected on the development of substance use and disorders, risk and protective factors, and HIV/AIDS risk behaviors. Participants are re-interviewed whether they are (re)incarcerated or back in the community. We propose to conduct annual interviews 10, 11, 12, and 13 years post-baseline, collect records, and test for HIV infection and selected STIs. Focusing on racial/ethnic disparities, gender and age differences, and effects of incarceration, we will: (1) describe patterns of drug use and disorder - onset, persistence, desistence, and recurrence -- as juvenile justice youth age from adolescence to emerging adulthood and young adulthood; (2) describe patterns of HIV/AIDS risk behaviors during this same period; (3) describe the prevalence and incidence of HIV infection and other STIs; and (4) examine the relationship between drug use and disorder and HIV/AIDS risk behaviors. Extending the Northwestern Juvenile Project allows us to leverage the data already collected to examine health disparities and the role of disproportionate minority confinement in the development of drug use and disorder and HIV/AIDS risk; to identify risk and protective factors that are potentially malleable; to identify points of intervention at key developmental periods; and to extend theoretical models - developed in general population adolescents - to correctional populations.           ","Drug Use, Disorder & HIV/AIDS Risk in Juvenile Justice Youth:A Longitudinal

"Drug Abuse, Incarceration & Health Disparities in HIV/AIDS: A Longitudinal Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this project is to address how disproportionate confinement of racial/ethnic minorities-especially African Americans-affects health disparities in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. African Americans comprise only 13% of the general population, but about 40% of incarcerated youth and adults and 50% of new cases of HIV/AIDS. Yet, large multisite national longitudinal studies of HIV/AIDS focus on high- risk samples such as men who have sex with men (MACS), women infected with HIV and other ""at-risk"" females (WIHS), and infected women and their infants (WITS). These studies do not include adolescents, do not sample correctional populations, and do not examine the effect of incarceration on HIV/AIDS. Most studies of incarcerated populations are cross-sectional and provide limited information on the effects of incarceration.  To continue to address this key omission in the literature, we propose to extend the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a longitudinal study of 1829 juvenile justice youth, enrolled at age 10-18 years (1172 males, 657 females; 1005 African Americans, 296 non-Hispanic whites, 524 Hispanics, and 4 ""other"" race/ethnicity). Currently, the HIV/AIDS component of the project (RO1 DA022953) includes only a subsample (n=743) and 10-, 11-, 12-, and 13-year follow-up interviews. We now propose to (1) study the entire sample (originally 1829, now 1678); (2) conduct 3 additional annual interviews (14-, 15-, and 16-year follow-ups), at which time participants will be aged 26-34 years; (3) collect official records to cross-validate self-reported data (on STI status, arrests, incarceration history, and services received); (4) test the entire sample for HIV infection, chlamydia, and gonorrhea; and (5) administer a new module on incarceration, release, and re-entry. Participants are re-interviewed whether they are re-incarcerated or back in the community. Using data collected in prior phases and the additional interviews, we will examine patterns of drug use, drug use disorder, HIV/AIDS risk and infection from adolescence (ages 10-17 years) to emerging adulthood (ages 18-24 years) and young adulthood (age 25 and older). Our Specific Aims focus on how incarceration, release, and re-entry (e.g., age[s] incarcerated, number of incarcerations, length of incarcerations, amount of time spent in the community between incarcerations) affect the following: (1) drug use behaviors (including the number and types of substances used, frequency of use, and route of administration) and drug use disorders (onset, persistence, desistance, and recurrence); (2) HIV/AIDS sex risk behaviors (including unprotected anal or vaginal receptive sex and trading sex for drugs) and injection-risk behaviors; (3) prevalence and incidence of HIV infection and other STIs; (4) the relationship between patterns of drug use and disorder and HIV/AIDS risk behaviors, especially how risk and protective factors predict, moderate, and mediate these relationships.  This study responds to the initiatives of NIDA, NIAAA, and other NIH institutes to reduce health disparities in HIV/AIDS in minority populations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial/ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately from the HIV/AIDS epidemic and are disproportionately incarcerated. To address health disparities in HIV/AIDS, we must study correctional populations, which increased from nearly 1.8 million in 1997 to over 2.2 million by mid-year 2006. The proposed study will guide public health policy by investigating how incarceration affects the development of substance use and disorder and HIV/AIDS; identifying risk and protective factors that are potentially malleable; identifying points of intervention during key developmental periods; and extending current conceptual models to include incarceration, release, and reentry.          Relevance: Racial/ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately from the HIV/AIDS epidemic and are disproportionately incarcerated.

"Preventing Drug Abuse and HIV in Hispanic First Offenders Hispanic youth in the juvenile justice system are at increased risk of HIV infection and of using illicit drugs. The proposed study’s overarching goal is to reduce the ethnic disparities in illicit drug use and HIV between Hispanic and non-Hispanic youth in the criminal justice system. The proposed 2-year study will be guided by four aims. AIM 1 is to evaluate the efficacy of Familias Unidas, relative to Treatment as Usual in preventing illicit drug use in a sample of Hispanic youth first offenders; AIM 2 is to evaluate the efficacy of Familias Unidas, relative to Treatment as Usual in preventing unsafe sexual behavior; AIM 3 is to evaluate the efficacy of Familias Unidas, relative to Treatment as Usual in reducing the number of subsequent criminal offenses; and AIM 4 is to assess the extent to which family functioning mediates the effects of the intervention on illicit drug use, unsafe sexual behavior, and subsequent criminal offenses. 240 Hispanic adolescent first offenders (age range 13 to 17) and their parents will be randomized to either Familias Unidas or Treatment as Usual. Youth and parent participants will be assed at baseline, post-intervention (i.e., 6-months post baseline), and 12-months post baseline.   The Familias Unidas intervention has been evaluated and found to be efficacious in two randomized trials. In the first study (Pantin et al., 2003), Familias Unidas was shown to be efficacious relative to a no intervention control condition in increasing family functioning and reducing behavior problems. In the second randomized trial (Prado et al., 2007), Familias Unidas was found to be efficacious, relative to two attention control conditions, in reducing illicit drug use and unprotected sexual behavior at last sexual intercourse. In both trials, family functioning was found to mediate the effects of condition on the outcomes. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) will be used to test: (H1) Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than Treatment as Usual in reducing illicit drug use over time; (H2) Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than Treatment as Usual in reducing unprotected sexual behavior use over time; and (H3) Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than Treatment as Usual in preventing subsequent criminal offenses. Additionally HLM will be used to determine whether (H1a) the effect of Familias Unidas on illicit drug use will be partially mediated by family functioning; (H2a) the effect of Familias Unidas on unprotected sexual behavior will be partially mediated by family functioning and (H3a) the effect of Familias Unidas on subsequent criminal offenses will be partially mediated by family functioning.   The objective of the proposed study is to reduce illicit drug use and unsafe sexual behavior health disparities in Hispanic populations and particularly among youth in the juvenile justice setting. The knowledge expected to be gained from this study will aid in the development of effective interventions to reduce drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and HIV in Hispanic adolescents.",Preventing Drug Abuse and HIV in Hispanic First Offenders,7894960,R01DA025894,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' Americas ', ' dl-Amphetamine ', ' Phenopromin ', ' Phenamine ', ' Desoxynorephedrin ', ' Amphetamines ', ' assault ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Coitus ', ' Communication ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Justice ', ' delinquent youth ', ' Young offender ', ' Juvenile Offender ', ' juvenile delinquent ', ' Latin America ', ' Linear Models ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Testing ', ' Stealing ', ' Theft ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' County ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Family Study ', ' Area ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dependence ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Cigarette ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Categories ', ' Prevention ', ' criminal offender ', ' offender ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' parent monitoring ', ' parental monitoring ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' post intervention ', ' youth drug use ', ' adolescent drug use ', ' Outcome ', ' juvenile justice system ', ' Population ', ' parental involvement ', ' effective intervention ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' early adolescence ', ' intervention effect ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2010,650633,0.13551991655777793
"Race and HIV-risk: Contextual and neurocognitive influences on sex partnerships    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this R21 application in response to NIDA's ANSWHR Initiative (PAS-07-381) is to address gaps in literature focused on HIV risk and disparities among females. In the United States as rates have increased among females, the rate of HIV/AIDS diagnoses for African American females approaches 25 times the rate for white females. Despite the broad base of findings documenting health disparities in HIV, extant studies cannot explain why African Americans continue to be disproportionately affected. Currently, there is a hidden HIV epidemic among young adult African American females with no history of substance abuse. These women are at increased risk for contracting HIV by virtue of their social networks. The proposed study requests two years of support for a cross sectional epidemiologic examination of racial/ethnic differences in sexual partnerships among 220 females (110 Black and 110 White) residing in low socioeconomic status (SES) neighborhoods. Guided by ecosocial theory, we seek to explain why these differences exist across race/ethnicity. We will consider the extent to which neighborhood social and economic factors (e.g., drug markets) interact with race/ethnicity to produce different levels of HIV risk. We will expand drug abuse and HIV prevention research by, in addition to considering individual differences, examining the influences of neighborhood drug markets on the sexual behaviors, sexual partnerships and rates of a sexually transmitted disease among young adult females residing in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Finally, the proposed study will move beyond descriptive social epidemiology and into identifying neurocognitive processes that mediate/moderate relationships between neighborhood factors and individual behavior. As, a small yet growing base of research suggests, to the extent that individuals are able to make decisions, solve problems and control impulses, neurocognitive functions may serve as protective factors or pathways through which external social factors influence individual behavior. Identifying social factors that influence partner selection and individual level factors that may serve to reduce the adverse effects of living in disadvantage neighborhoods will inform HIV prevention interventions for African American and underserved women. If successful, the proposed research project: (1) should provide insight into why African American females have higher rates of HIV than their white counterparts; (2) highlight the importance of considering the contextual influences of drugs, that is the influence of drug markets on social structures and sexual norms and behaviors; and (3) identify modifiable individual level factors linking neighborhood social and economic factors to individual HIV risk behaviors.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Currently, there is a hidden HIV epidemic among young adult African American females with no history of substance abuse. These women are at increased risk for contracting HIV by virtue of their social/sexual networks. If successful, the proposed research project: (1) should provide insight into why African American females have higher rates of HIV than their white counterparts; (2) highlight the importance of considering the contextual influences of drugs, that is how drug markets change social structures and altered sexual norms and behaviors of entire communities; and (3) increase understanding of the processes through which neighborhood factors influence HIV risk.          ",Race and HIV-risk: Contextual and neurocognitive influences on sex partnerships,7851232,R21DA025543,"['Decision Making ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Social Network ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Fellowship ', ' Female ', ' Social Impacts ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Link ', ' Infection ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' insight ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' sexual relationship ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Literature ', ' Inequality ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Poverty ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Science ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Social Change ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Life ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Attention ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' psychosocial ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' AIDS/HIV diagnosis ', ' professor ', ' condoms ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' drug market ', ' social inequality ', ' economic cost ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Gender ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' theories ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' 1 year old ', ' one year old ', ' age 1 year ', ' Communities ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' drug distribution ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Consultations ', ' ']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R21,2010,246574,0.014044230329847649
"Interdisciplinary Research Training Institute on Hispanic Drug Abuse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Interdisciplinary Research Training Institute (IRTI) on Hispanic Drug Abuse seeks to promote the career development of pre-doctoral, postdoctoral and early career clinically-focused scientists interested in conducting research as it affects the Hispanic population. This comprehensive and coordinated research education program aims at providing research experience and increasing the skills required for development of testable hypothesis, preparation and submission of research applications for appropriate NIH extramural funding (i.e. K01, K08, F31, F32, R03, R21, etc). Building upon the National Hispanic Science Network's Summer Research Training Institute, the IRTI has two short-term goals and two long-term goals as follows: (1) enhancing the fellows' knowledge and skills for conducting interdisciplinary research on drug abuse; (2) increasing the number of early career faculty who establish vibrant and independent programs of drug abuse research, (3) increasing the amount and quality of research on minority health and health disparities; and, (4) improving the health of minorities in part by decreasing minority health disparities. The aims of the IRTI are: 1. Provide an educational training opportunity that will enhance the skills for conducting interdisciplinary Hispanic drug research and developing applications for NIH funding among pre-doctoral, postdoctoral and early career faculty (fellows) through the implementation of a 14 day intensive summer research training program; 2. Execute a mentoring plan that would be organized and structured around a team of interdisciplinary mentors that would be accessible and available to provide selected fellows with focused mentoring and continual support; and 3. Provide a networking structure and process that will assist fellows in building and maintaining relationships and communication with leading experts in the field of Hispanic drug research and fellow peers. Overall, mentoring activities will focus on guiding and assisting the fellows in achieving benchmarks of progress including: a) Academic Career Progress; b) Scientific Publications; c) Scientific Presentations and d) Research Funding. These outcomes will be facilitated through various types of support including: Mentor Commitment, Travel to Mentor Institution, Conferences/Workshops, and IRTI Mentoring Annual Meeting and IRTI Scientific Conference. The complex and technical nature of contemporary drug abuse research and the growing demands for drug-related knowledge across several disciplines requires that competitive research investigators develop a broad-based set of scientific knowledge and scientific research skills that will facilitate the conduct of interdisciplinary drug abuse research in the interest of public health. The proposed IRTI and its mentorship and networking components will begin to fill the gap in knowledge of how to effectively develop specific incubators that will be successful in growing a special generation of drug abuse research scientists.

"National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse (NHSN) Annual Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R13 meetings grant application seeks support for five yearly three-day stand alone conferences to be held at selected locations beginning in the fall of 2009. This proposal reflects a collaborative initiative between Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center and the National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse (NHSN), based at the University of Miami. The annual scientific conferences help to accomplish the NHSN mission of fostering both interdisciplinary and translational research, by promoting dialogue between biologic, social, behavioral, and cultural scientists and disseminating findings back to the field. Previous conferences, supported through a NIDA-funded contract, have been an effective platform for developing the aims of the NHSN, with particular emphasis on mentoring and training Hispanic graduate students and early career scientists. The aims of the conferences will be: A) to advance science in the area of drug abuse research and its co-morbid conditions, particularly as it impacts on the Hispanic population. It will promote bidirectional translational research ranging from bench to community and a trans-disciplinary cross-fertilization of ideas among scientists from all fields of drug abuse helping to establish future research priorities. B) To foster the development of Hispanic researchers, with emphasis in areas related to drug abuse research by facilitating the development of integrated and continuous collaborative and mentoring networks. Funding is requested to support participation for 50 trainees/early career scientists and 20 research scientists presenting in the scientific panels. An average of 150 participants, representing the field from the national and international scientific communities, are expected at each yearly conference, including members of the global research community whose interests encompass a multifaceted approach to understanding the factors underlying health disparities as they pertain to drug use and abuse ranging from epidemiology to environmental health, psychology, sociology, health policy, neuroscience and other biomedical sciences, and epigenetics. The first conference proposed ""Integrating Population, Laboratory, and Clinical Sciences in Minority Health"" will be hosted by the University of Miami, from December 1-3, 2009. The format of the conference aims to provide ample opportunity for discussion, networking, and collaboration discussions as well as development of new ideas related to training and mentoring of the next generation of researchers in the field of drug abuse.

"HIV - Emergence of Drug Resistance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is to renew a project focused on using mathematical models to understand and predict the emergence of drug resistance to antiretrovirals (ARVs) for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). As the usage rate of ARVs in resource-poor regions is increasing, high levels of drug resistance potentially could emerge and have a devastating impact on public health worldwide, derailing global plans to provide this treatment to many millions of HIV-infected individuals. Our proposed projects will extend the work of the current award, which showed the value of using mathematical models to understand the temporal dynamics of drug-resistant strains of HIV in the United States (US), and for predicting the magnitude of resistance in this setting. In the renewal our work will be extended by combining mathematical modeling with statistical analysis of datasets collected by collaborating groups in the US, Europe and Africa. We will have access to data on drug resistance and important related variables from large scale epidemiological and treatment studies conducted in these three continents. In resource-poor settings, such as Africa, drugs will be limited and thus demand will often greatly exceed supply. We will investigate the problems of allocating ARVs in Africa by using operation research (OR) techniques. We have three Specific Aims. Aim 1: to understand the emergence, explain the present, and predict the evolution of, complex epidemics of drug-resistant strains of HIV in the US and Europe. Aim 2: to predict the evolution of epidemics of drug-resistant strains, as a result of first- line regimens and prophylactic use of ARVs, in Africa. Aim 3: to evaluate the consequences of allocation of scarce HIV healthcare resources in Africa. To achieve this aim we will use models to evaluate the epidemiological and ethical consequences of gender-inequities in access to treatment, assess the epidemiological and ethical impact of treatment priority criteria, and determine healthcare resource allocation strategies that ensure sustainability. Our studies in the renewal will link transmission modeling, OR techniques and statistical analyses; our analyses will take advantage of the extraordinary data sets provided by our collaborators in the US, Europe and Africa.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The emergence and control of drug-resistant strains of HIV is now a global problem. The epidemiology of this problem is complex, and the future of the HIV epidemic is unknown. Our projects focus on using mathematical models to understand, explain, and predict, the evolution of complex epidemics composed of drug-resistant strains of HIV in the US, Europe and Africa. The rollout of antiretrovirals in Africa is just beginning; however demand for drugs greatly exceeds supply. We will, by using mathematical models, evaluate the epidemiological and ethical consequences of allocation of the scarce supply of antiretrovirals in Africa. Our studies are based upon both mathematical modeling and data analyses. Our analyses will take advantage of the extraordinary data sets provided by our collaborators in the US, Europe and Africa. Our results will have direct relevance for health policy makers.          ",HIV - Emergence of Drug Resistance,7797488,R01AI041935,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' microbicide ', '

"Role of Race in Criminal Justice Referrals to Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The criminal justice system has become the primary source of referrals to drug treatment. Despite substantial evidence that minorities, particularly African Americans, are over-represented in the drug arrestee population, they remain a relatively small share of criminal justice referrals. It has yet to be determined if this lower representation is a function of racial and ethnic disparities in the criminal justice system or an artifact of some common case-level factors that reduce minority eligibility for treatment referral. We propose to examine the adjudication of drug offenders in California from 1982- 2005 to determine the extent to which race/ethnicity has played a role in final disposition and referral to drug treatment. California represents a unique environment in which to examine these associations because of its demographic and regional diversity, availability of detailed administrative data representing a census of individuals arrested and processed, and adoption of two important policies - drug courts and diversion - that promote treatment in lieu of incarceration. The proposed study significantly improves existing research by considering temporal and geographic patterns in disparities at each stage of the adjudication process within a single state subject to the same rule of law. It comprehensively considers the role of race/ethnicity at each stage of the adjudication process and the net effect on the final placement of minorities in treatment, and so may identify why previous studies have provided inconsistent results. Finally, by considering the impact of restorative justice policies, such as drug courts and diversion, on the processing of drug offenders by race/ethnicity, this project will assist policymakers with efforts to reduce disparities in the criminal justice and treatment system. The elimination of health disparities is an overarching goal of Healthy People 2010. The criminal justice system is critical to eliminating disparities because minorities, particularly African Americans, are substantially over-represented in this population and because the criminal justice system is the largest referral source to treatment. A careful examination of the adjudication process for drug offenders will make it possible to determine if differential access to treatment truly exists among arrestees and what factors have caused it. Further, by examining trends in adjudication practices using a large panel data set in California, this study will be able to explicitly consider whether recent policy reforms aimed at improving access to treatment particularly among minorities have indeed done so.           ",Role of Race in Criminal Justice Referrals to Treatment,7794862,R01DA022719,"['Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Environment ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adoption ', ' Guidelines ', ' court ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Justice ', ' Laws ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Noise ', ' Play ', ' Staging ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' SAMHSA ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' California ', ' adjudication ', ' adjudicative process and procedure ', ' offender ', ' criminal offender ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' sorting ', ' Censuses ', ' County ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' parole ', ' Drug Courts ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NIDA,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2010,147864,0.09882567964943394
"African American Female Drug Users: HIV, Health Disparities, & Criminality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this study is to understand how drug use and criminality are related to health disparities, particularly HIV, and service utilization among African American drug using and non-drug using women across criminal justice status. While drug use is similar across racial groups in the US, African Americans are disproportionately more likely to experience severe health consequences and criminal involvement as a result of drug misuse. Adequate health care may not be received by African American female offenders because they experience the burden of their race, class, gender, and criminal offender status. There is limited scientific data to help understand the linkages between health disparities such as HIV, untreated drug abuse, barriers to service utilization, and status as a criminal offender among African American females. This study is significant because of its potential to identify differences in health disparities and service utilization among African American drug using and non-drug using women in selected levels of criminal justice status (intensive correctional supervision-prison (n=200), moderate correctional supervision-jail (n=200), community supervision-probation (n=200), and no criminal justice involvement (n=200)). All 800 African American females will be followed longitudinally for three 6-month intervals to examine health status and the use of health services across time. The specific aims are: (1) To describe the prevalence of health problems among African American women across criminal justice status and drug use status; (2) To determine the cultural, predisposing, historical health, and potential enabling factors that are predictors of health problems among African American drug using and non-drug using women across criminal justice status over 18 months; (3) To describe the prevalence of untreated health problems, the patterns of health services utilization, and the cultural barriers to service utilization among African American women across criminal justice status and drug use status; and (4) To examine the factors that predict the likelihood of using health services among African American drug using and non-drug using women across criminal justice status over 18 months. The significance of this study includes the potential to provide criminal justice systems-level data for health planning and health policy for prevention, intervention, and treatment of African American female drug users.       This study is significant to the public health field because of its potential to understand the severity of health disparities among African American women across criminal justice status and drug use status and to predict health status and the use of health services over time. This knowledge of African American females can be used as a foundation for future criminal justice systems-level interventions to increase the use of preventative health care and subsequently reduce the need for expensive medical services, as well as to decrease HIV risk behaviors including drug use, unprotected sex, and recidivism.          ","African American Female Drug Users: HIV, Health

"Drug Policy, Incarceration, Community Re-entry, and Race Disparities in HIV/AIDS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a revision of an application submitted last year in response to PAR-07-379, ""Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Disparities."" We will analyze the interconnections between coercive mobility (the massive migration between the criminal justice [CJ] system and the community) produced by US drug policies and race disparities in HIV-related sexual risk among a sample of drug offenders in Connecticut (CT). Further, we will examine whether the association between coercive mobility (CM) and HIV-related sexual risk is affected by the degree of social disorganization in the communities in which these offenders reside. We also will study the feasibility of recruiting and following sexual partners of these individuals to better understand the impacts of CM on partners' HIV-related risk. We hypothesize that CM produces race disparities in HIV risk in a number of distinct ways: 1) Blacks are more likely than Whites to be incarcerated, so HIV-related sexual risk associated with CM can produce race disparities in HIV risk even if the effects of CM are the same for both Blacks and Whites; 2) Blacks are more likely than Whites to reside in communities experiencing the disorganizing impacts of CM, so to the extent that social disorganization exacerbates the effects of CM, it will affect the HIV risks of Blacks to a greater degree than Whites; 3) The sexual partners of Blacks are more likely to come from these same socially disorganized communities, furthering the negative impacts of CM for both returning inmates and their partners, and contributing to race disparities in HIV risk among women; and 4) Blacks are more likely to be penalized by drug policies in ways that increase their movement between prison/jail and the community and their vulnerability to its associated harms. We also hypothesize that we will be able to recruit and retain the sexual partners of study participants and conduct exploratory analyses of the impact of CM on their HIV-related sexual risk. An active Community Advisory Board including policymakers and program administrators will assist us in identifying structural interventions to reduce race disparities in HIV based on study findings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will examine the interconnections among drug policies in the US, coercive mobility (massive migration in and out of the criminal justice system), and race disparities in HIV-related sexual risk. It will suggest potential structural interventions for addressing the movement between prison/jail and the community, including drug policy reforms, with the potential to reduce race disparities in HIV/AIDS.

"Rural and Urban African American Cocaine Users' Perceived Need for Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to study the factors associated with rural/urban differences in perceived need for both drug abuse treatment and HIV testing because these are complementary services which could be integrated within formal drug abuse treatment programs or other locations to better meet the needs of African American cocaine users. We focus on perceived need among African American cocaine users because of their low rates of drug abuse treatment and HIV testing nationally as well as their demonstrated low perceived need for drug abuse treatment, high rates of risky sexual behaviors, and aversion to seeking HIV testing at local health departments in our prior research. Given that our prior natural history research did not include any urban areas, we do not know whether the low rates of drug abuse treatment and HIV testing among rural Arkansans are specific to rural residents (e.g., whether there is a disparity in access for rural African Americans) or whether urban African American cocaine users differ in other critical factors. To address these issues, we plan to conduct a community-based mixed methods study of African American cocaine users residing in rural and urban areas of Arkansas. Specifically, we propose a sequential mixed-method design, with qualitative key informant interviews conducted first (30 rural, 30 urban), followed by larger-scale, structured interviews (200 rural, 200 urban) using standardized instruments, pertinent measures from our prior rural health services and HIV research, and newly developed questions based on our initial qualitative work. Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS), a variant of snowball sampling, will be used to identify and recruit participants. The primary aims of the study are: 1) Using qualitative methods, to describe rural/urban differences in pathways to drug use and drug use cultures, perceptions of access to drug abuse treatment and HIV testing, awareness and perceptions of what constitutes drug abuse treatment and HIV testing, and preferences for formal or informal drug abuse treatment and the site or location of HIV testing; 2) Using quantitative and qualitative methods, to compare and contrast rural and urban cocaine users' perceived need for drug abuse treatment and HIV testing and key predisposing, enabling, health, and other factors which could impede or facilitate perceived need; and 3) Using quantitative methods, to investigate whether rural/urban differences in perceived need for drug abuse treatment and HIV testing are mediated by key predisposing, enabling, and health factors as well as treatment and testing awareness and preferences.

"Clinical and Social Implications of Cost Sharing for Cancer Drugs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Yu-Ning Wong, a Medical Oncologist at Fox Chase Cancer Center is dedicated to a career in cancer health services research. Her goal is to develop a multidisciplinary research program to understand the impact of insurance design on cancer drug utilization and clinical outcomes. This Career Development Award will provide the means to take two important steps towards accomplishing this goal. First, it will allow for additional intensive mentored education and training in public policy research, health economics, and advanced statistical methods that will augment the candidate's previous rigorous training in epidemiology, biostatistics, and clinical medicine. Second, it will support the development of an original clinical research program using rigorous epidemiologic, econometric and survey methods to examine the impact of prescription drug insurance coverage on cancer outcomes. As new costly cancer drugs are introduced, patients with both public and private insurance are facing higher out- of-pocket costs. Cost sharing between insurers and patients (though co-payments and deductibles) has been traditionally used to control costs based on an expectation that unnecessary health care utilization will be reduced. However this expectation may result in worse socioeconomic disparities in care since some patients may be unable to afford highly effective cancer treatments. The candidate proposes three complementary studies to address the important, unanswered questions about the impact of cost sharing on cancer outcomes. Project A is a conjoint analysis-based survey to measure how patients make decisions among treatments of varying efficacy, toxicity and cost. Project B uses the results from Project A in a decision analysis model to measure the sensitivity of clinical outcomes to price and patient preferences. This will also allow us to determine if is possible to improve clinical outcomes by using low cost sharing to increase adherence to high value treatments. Project C is a natural experiment using insurance claims to measure the effect of insurance design and sociodemographic factors on the receipt of a new, expensive anti-nausea medication and subsequent outcomes. This research program will triangulate on the nexus of issues central to the understanding of cost sharing on cancer drug utilization and clinical outcomes and form the foundation for the candidate's transition to an independent investigator in cancer health services research. This project will have broad implications for the financing of high cost medical interventions because it will help policy makers, insurers and physicians understand how current models of cost sharing may contribute to socioeconomic disparities in cancer care. Our results may suggest consideration of a novel benefit design that encourages patients to make decisions based on relative value, rather than cost alone.           ",Clinical and Social Implications of Cost Sharing for Cancer Drugs,7923351,K07CA136995,"['Cost Control ', ' Cost Containment ', ' Decision Analysis ', ' Decision Analyses ', ' Decision Making ', ' Deductibles ', ' aprepitant ', ' Diffusion ', ' Drug Utilization ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Policy Research ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Fox Chase Cancer Center ', ' Observational Study ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adoption ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' improved ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Insurance ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Training ', ' Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' total medical expenditure ', ' medical expenses not covered by insurance ', ' Uninsured Medical Fees (not covered) ', ' Uncovered Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' Uncovered Medical Expenses ', ' Out-of-Pocket Expense ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Nausea ', ' Medical Oncologist ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Antiemetics ', ' Antiemetic Drugs ', ' Antiemetic Agents ', ' Anti-emetics ', ' Probability ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' anticancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Public Policy ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' United States ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Training and Education ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' payment ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' Drug Insurance ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' Underinsured ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' chemotherapy ', ' social implication ', ' ']",NCI,FOX CHASE CANCER CENTER,K07,2010,143678,0.027485458307407232
"Drug Abuse, Incarceration & Health Disparities in HIV/AIDS: A Longitudinal Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this project is to address how disproportionate confinement of racial/ethnic minorities-especially African Americans-affects health disparities in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. African Americans comprise only 13% of the general population, but about 40% of incarcerated youth and adults and 50% of new cases of HIV/AIDS. Yet, large multisite national longitudinal studies of HIV/AIDS focus on high- risk samples such as men who have sex with men (MACS), women infected with HIV and other ""at-risk"" females (WIHS), and infected women and their infants (WITS). These studies do not include adolescents, do not sample correctional populations, and do not examine the effect of incarceration on HIV/AIDS. Most studies of incarcerated populations are cross-sectional and provide limited information on the effects of incarceration.  To continue to address this key omission in the literature, we propose to extend the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a longitudinal study of 1829 juvenile justice youth, enrolled at age 10-18 years (1172 males, 657 females; 1005 African Americans, 296 non-Hispanic whites, 524 Hispanics, and 4 ""other"" race/ethnicity). Currently, the HIV/AIDS component of the project (RO1 DA022953) includes only a subsample (n=743) and 10-, 11-, 12-, and 13-year follow-up interviews. We now propose to (1) study the entire sample (originally 1829, now 1678); (2) conduct 3 additional annual interviews (14-, 15-, and 16-year follow-ups), at which time participants will be aged 26-34 years; (3) collect official records to cross-validate self-reported data (on STI status, arrests, incarceration history, and services received); (4) test the entire sample for HIV infection, chlamydia, and gonorrhea; and (5) administer a new module on incarceration, release, and re-entry. Participants are re-interviewed whether they are re-incarcerated or back in the community. Using data collected in prior phases and the additional interviews, we will examine patterns of drug use, drug use disorder, HIV/AIDS risk and infection from adolescence (ages 10-17 years) to emerging adulthood (ages 18-24 years) and young adulthood (age 25 and older). Our Specific Aims focus on how incarceration, release, and re-entry (e.g., age[s] incarcerated, number of incarcerations, length of incarcerations, amount of time spent in the community between incarcerations) affect the following: (1) drug use behaviors (including the number and types of substances used, frequency of use, and route of administration) and drug use disorders (onset, persistence, desistance, and recurrence); (2) HIV/AIDS sex risk behaviors (including unprotected anal or vaginal receptive sex and trading sex for drugs) and injection-risk behaviors; (3) prevalence and incidence of HIV infection and other STIs; (4) the relationship between patterns of drug use and disorder and HIV/AIDS risk behaviors, especially how risk and protective factors predict, moderate, and mediate these relationships.  This study responds to the initiatives of NIDA, NIAAA, and other NIH institutes to reduce health disparities in HIV/AIDS in minority populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial/ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately from the HIV/AIDS epidemic and are disproportionately incarcerated. To address health disparities in HIV/AIDS, we must study correctional populations, which increased from nearly 1.8 million in 1997 to over 2.2 million by mid-year 2006. The proposed study will guide public health policy by investigating how incarceration affects the development of substance use and disorder and HIV/AIDS; identifying risk and protective factors that are potentially malleable; identifying points of intervention during key developmental periods; and extending current conceptual models to include incarceration, release, and reentry.","Drug Abuse,

"Public Housing Relocations: Impact on Healthcare Access, Drug Use & Sexual Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A rapidly unfolding intervention in Atlanta provides a rare opportunity to advance health services research for a vulnerable population: poor Black drug users. The Atlanta Housing Authority (AHA) is relocating all 5,000 residents of seven concentrated public housing communities to homes spread across Atlanta. Past research indicates that relocates tend to move to census tracts that have markedly better socioeconomic and healthcare environments than their original tracts; however, their social networks and support systems shrink after they move. The AHA relocations thus offer a rare opportunity to deepen scientific knowledge about the ways in which neighborhood, network, and social support factors shape Black drug users' healthcare access and health. Mining this opportunity will advance several NIDA priority areas, but is predicated on rapid funding of this project: three AHA communities (the ""BBT"" communities) have already begun the relocation process, and four others (the ""HHRP"" communities, which include Herndon Homes, Hollywood Court, Roosevelt, and Palmer) will begin to relocate in 2009. Traditional NIH funding cycles are too slow to realize the opportunities presented by the AHA relocations. While we presently have funds to gather pre-relocation data on 150 BBT residents, this sample size is insufficient to explore multilevel hypotheses. A team of two new investigators with a history of collaboration is thus seeking Time Sensitive R21 funds to achieve the following aims: (1) For 200 Black drug-using residents of the four HHRP communities, describe pre-relocation neighborhood, network, and social support characteristics (e.g., spatial access to drug treatment, drug network size, recovery support), and residents' (a) access to and retention in drug treatment, and primary care access; (b) drug use patterns; and (c) sexual risk and sexually transmitted infection (STI) status. We will integrate spatial, survey, and biological data to achieve Aim 1. (2) For 100 ex-residents of the two communities that will relocate first (Herndon Homes and Hollywood Court), assess participants' post-relocation status on the variables listed in Aim 1, and pre-/post-relocation changes in these variables. (3) For the total sample of 350 residents of the HHRP and BBT communities, conduct exploratory cross-sectional analyses of pre-relocation relationships between neighborhoods, network and social support characteristics and participants' (a) access to and retention in drug treatment, and access to primary care; (b) drug use patterns; and (c) sexual risk behaviors and STI infection status. We will also initiate preliminary analyses of the 100 Herndon Homes and Hollywood Court participants' pre-/post-relocation data to explore how changes in exposures relate to changes in outcomes. We will seek R01 funds to conduct a longitudinal study of the 350-member cohort that will test hypotheses generated by the R21. This longitudinal R01 study will establish the direction of relationships identified in the R21 in a sample of sufficient size to draw firm statistical conclusions about topics of major scientific import to NIDA.           Project Narrative The proposed R21 study will advance scientific knowledge in several NIDA priority areas that pertain to racial/ethnic disparities in health service access and health: (1) We will study health service and health outcomes that disproportionately affect poor, Black drug users, namely suboptimal access to, and retention in, drug treatment and poor primary care access; harmful drug use patterns; and HIV/STI sexual risk and STI infections. (2) We are seeking the causes of these outcomes in Black drug users' neighborhoods, networks, and social support systems, thereby expanding the traditional etiologic frame beyond individual-level exposures, and exploring the pathways linking these exposures and outcomes. (3) Our analytic plan will allow us to distinguish the impacts of individual-level processes from those of neighborhood-level processes, a distinction that ecologic analyses alone cannot capture.

"Substance Use and Risky Sex in Highly Vulnerable Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed project will help me develop the skills and expertise necessary to establish an independent research career focused on the role of substance use in sexual risk-taking behavior and associated adverse reproductive outcomes, especially sexually transmitted infections (STIs). To achieve this goal, I will supplement my graduate training as a developmental psychologist and postdoctoral training in epidemiology with training in sexual risk behavior in vulnerable populations, health disparities associated with race, and career development in longitudinal research methodology. Complementary to these training activities, I propose: 1) secondary data analyses of sexual risk behavior and outcomes using data from an ongoing longitudinal study of the offspring of teenage mothers and a study of women with and without borderline personality disorder (BPD); 2) collection of new data on the offspring of teenage mothers during a 16-year assessment and; 3) a new pilot study of common STIs in this sample (offspring of teenage mothers). The proposed research will form the basis for an R01 application in the third year of the award period. My short term goals are to (1) increase knowledge about risk for STIs, including behavioral dysregulation that may underlie risky sex and risk factors associated with risky sex and associated outcomes, (2) learn new methods of measuring risk behavior and adverse reproductive outcomes, including clinical tests for STIs and  event-level assessments, (3) learn more about health disparities associated with race, and (4) develop the research skills that will enable me to become an independent investigator and obtain NIH funding to support my research, specifically longitudinal data analyses. My long-term career goal is to understand the ecological setting for drug use and sexual risk behaviors in vulnerable populations, and how drug use may contribute to significantly higher rates of unintended pregnancies and STIs in African-American youth. The proposed career development training will take place at the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. This department provides an outstanding environment for interdisciplinary training by highly collaborative faculty who are leading experts in their chosen fields. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed research will help identify behavioral risk factors for sexually transmitted infections that are implicated in higher rates of HIV, especially among African-Americans. The results can be used to develop prevention programs aimed at reducing drug use and sexually transmitted infections among vulnerable adolescents and within psychiatric populations.

"In-Home Prevention of SA risks in Native Teen Families    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of ""In-Home Prevention of Substance Abuse Risks for Native Teen Families,"" (NIDA 5R01DA019042) and this renewal is to assess the efficacy of the ""Family Spirit"" (FS) intervention, a prenatal and early childhood home visiting program, delivered by American Indian (AI) paraprofessionals to AI teen mothers and their children. The FS intervention is designed to promote mother's effective parenting practices and reduce maternal and child emotional and behavioral risks for lifetime drug abuse. At the time of submission, we have recruited our entire sample (N=322), who at baseline are expectant AI teens, ages 12-19 years and < 32 weeks gestation from four southwestern AI reservation communities. Participants have been randomized 1:1 to the FS Intervention + Optimized Standard Care vs. Optimized Standard Care. This renewal will allow us to assess the FS intervention until 6 years postpartum, through the critical developmental time period when teen mothers transition to adulthood and their children begin school. High rates of teen child-rearing and drug use are intertwined perpetuators of multigenerational family problems in American Indian communities. Successful prevention interventions targeting effective parenting and maternal drug use prevention with AI teen mothers can change the trajectory of young mothers' and their children's lifetime risks for drug use, and help break the cycle of multi-generational family problems in reservation communities. The goal of this renewal is to extend the assessment period until 6 years post-partum to determine the impact of the FS intervention on longer-term maternal and child outcomes related to lifetime drug use risk. The expanded and extended assessment battery will assess mothers' parenting skills and children's developmental status from birth to 6 years postpartum; mothers' drug use from <32 weeks gestation to 6 years post-partum; and explore moderators and mediators of study outcome. This trial is the first to investigate the impact of a paraprofessional-delivered, early childhood home visiting intervention on lifetime multi-generational (mother-child) drug use risk. This study addresses extremely important behavior health and illicit drug use issues among AI teen mothers and their offspring in communities located on reservation or trust lands. Demonstrating the effective use of Native paraprofessionals will be an innovation in the home-visiting intervention field, and is a critical design element to be tested in low-resource communities that suffer nursing shortages, have few trained Native interventionists, and expressed preferences for indigenous providers.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This study addresses critical behavioral health disparities and drug abuse among American Indian teen mothers and their children in communities located on reservation lands. If the aims are achieved, scientific knowledge and clinical practice will be advanced in several areas important to early intervention with teen mothers in this and similar populations, and to prevention of behavior problems in young children that lead to adolescent and adult drug use.                          ",In-Home Prevention of SA risks in Native Teen Families,7987489,R01DA019042,"['Provider ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' substance abuse prevention ', ' substance abuse control ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Educational Status ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' Indigenous ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Reservations ', ' Lifetime Risk ', ' Monitor ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' House Call ', ' Home Visits ', ' Area ', ' Healed ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Training ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Life Experience ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' teenage mother ', ' teenage mom ', ' teen mother ', ' teen mom ', ' adolescent mother ', ' Trust ', ' Control Locus ', ' Measurement ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Marihuana ', ' marijuana ', ' Methamphetamine ', ' N-Methylamphetamine ', ' Methylamphetamine ', ' Desoxyephedrine ', ' Deoxyephedrine ', ' Crystal Meth ', ' Benzeneethanamine, N,alpha-dimethyl-, (S)- ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Mothers ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Parents ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' Schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Behavior ', ' maternal drug use ', ' Outcome Study ', ' interest ', ' preference ', ' Birth Intervals ', ' Birth Spacing ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' early childhood ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' offspring ', ' indian reservation ', ' tribal reservation ', ' reservation community ', ' native american reservation ', ' nation reservation ', ' american indian reservation ', ' Toddler ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Child Rearing ', ' childrearing ', ' Emotional ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' Postpartum ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Home visitation ', ' home visit ', ' healing ', ' dissemination research ', ' reservation-based ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' young mother ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' child bearing ', ' childbearing ', ' bearing children ', ' bear children ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' early intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' ']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,499927,0.11428451018129408
"Development of Behavioral and Social Interventions that Reduce Stigma and Improve    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application addresses the broad Challenge Area (01) Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention and the specific Challenge Topic, 01-DA-106: Development of behavioral and social interventions that reduce stigma and improve quality and accessibility of health care services in low resource settings. We will evaluate a pharmacy-based pilot intervention that combines rapid HIV testing with other preventive screening services including blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol screening. This pilot targeted to injection drug users (IDUs) who purchase syringes from pharmacies via the New York State Expanded Syringe Access Program (ESAP) - a program aimed at increasing sterile syringe access to help reduce HIV transmission. By combining HIV testing with less stigmatizing screening services and offering testing to all pharmacy patrons instead of singling out drug users, the likelihood of reducing HIV testing and drug use-associated stigma will increase. Although HIV testing is increasingly accessible and new testing technologies are available, HIV testing rates are low in the black and Hispanic community, especially among IDUs at risk for HIV and many other infectious and chronic diseases. Structural barriers (i.e., lack of health insurance) in the black and Hispanic community, especially among IDUs may limit access to regular health care/ preventive services. Access barriers are compounded by stigma associated with getting an HIV test that may identify an individual as a drug user and/or someone who engages in socially unacceptable behavior. Thus, this proposed study aims to 1) qualitatively evaluate HIV testing and chronic disease screening in pharmacies, 2) compare/contrast correlates of agreeing to a HIV test vs. not among IDU syringe customers and their peers and 3) qualitatively compare/contrast HIV testing with comprehensive screening services pharmacy (intervention) vs. HIV testing only pharmacy (control). To accomplish these aims, we propose to conduct in-depth interviews among key stakeholders to inform development of study materials, IDU/peer survey and pharmacy staff surveys. We will recruit 2 ESAP-registered Harlem pharmacies (1 intervention and 1 control) where our current work has developed the infrastructure to perform on-site screening services. Among the intervention and control pharmacies, 798 (518 non-drug using, 70 drug-using +3 networks/ drug user) pharmacy customers will be recruited. We will adapt a previously developed training module to train pharmacy personnel on how to engage pharmacy customers. Customers from the intervention pharmacy will complete a brief attitude scale on attitudes toward HIV, IDUs and stigma, watch an educational video on the importance of health screening (particularly HIV testing), participate in desired screening services and undergo a structured 20-minute ACASI that repeats the attitudes scale. Customers in the control pharmacy will only undergo HIV testing and a structured 20-minute ACASI survey. Semi-structured surveys will be administered to all pharmacy staff to ascertain impact of on-site prevention services on pharmacy personnel and business flow. We will use standard qualitative analytic techniques and GEE to account for clustering in quantitative analyses. The proposed research is highly significant in that it aims to explore a pilot intervention that involves expanding pharmacy services to include HIV testing and to determine if offering HIV testing within a comprehensive prevention approach that includes less stigmatizing screening tests (i.e., blood pressure, glucose and cholesterol screening) increases HIV testing among injection drug users who purchase syringes in pharmacies and their peers (drug-using and/or non-drug using). We will be using new HIV testing technologies and bringing technological innovations and treatment modalities to low-income communities in New York City. If successful, this model can be duplicated not only throughout other high-risk neighborhoods in New York, but in several other cities and states. If our findings are positive, broader public health impact could follow. Pharmacists can partner with clinicians and other health care providers to offer an integrative approach to HIV testing to high-risk injection drug using populations and to other groups with limited access to health care services such as the uninsured and undocumented immigrants. Adoption of this integrative approach to HIV testing on a larger scale could also be implemented and reduce many of the access and stigmatization barriers experienced in marginalized populations for HIV testing while simultaneously increasing and improving general health and well-being by targeting chronic disease outcomes that disproportionately affect marginalized populations.               NARRATIVE The proposed research is highly significant in that it aims to explore a pilot intervention that involves expanding pharmacy services to include HIV testing and to determine if offering HIV testing within a comprehensive prevention approach that includes less stigmatizing screening tests (i.e., blood pressure, glucose and cholesterol screening) increases HIV testing among injection drug users who purchase syringes in pharmacies and their peers (drug-using and/or non-drug using).

"Familias Unidas Stage III Study: Preventing Substance Abuse in Hispanic Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study's overarching goal is to reduce the ethnic disparities in illicit drug use, cigarette use, and HIV between Hispanic and non-Hispanic youth. This goal will be accomplished by four aims: AIM 1 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Practice (i.e., standard prevention services), in preventing illicit drug use; AIM 2 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Control, in preventing cigarette use; AIM 3 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Control, in preventing unprotected sexual behavior; and AIM 4 is to assess the extent to which family functioning mediates the effects of the intervention on illicit drug use, cigarette use, and unprotected sexual behavior. Twenty four middle schools with a total sample of 744 Hispanic adolescents from a wide geographic area of Miami-Dade County will be randomized using a block design to one of two conditions: Familias Unidas or Community Practice. The Familias Unidas intervention has been evaluated and found to be efficacious in two separate randomized controlled trials. In the first study (Pantin et al., 2003), Familias Unidas was shown to be efficacious relative to a no intervention control condition in increasing family functioning and reducing behavior problems (Prado et al., 2006), risk factors for youth illicit drug use and unprotected sex. In the second randomized controlled trial (Prado et al., in press), Familias Unidas was found to be efficacious, relative to two attention control conditions, in preventing cigarette use and illicit drug use. Familias Unidas was also found to be efficacious relative to both of the control conditions in preventing/reducing unprotected sexual behavior at last sexual intercourse. Finally, family functioning was found to mediate the effects of intervention condition on the outcomes. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) will be used to test: (H1) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing illicit drug use over time; (H2) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing cigarette use over time; and (H3) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing unprotected sexual behavior over time. Additionally HLM will be used to determine whether (H1a) the effect of Familias Unidas on illicit drug use will be partially mediated by family functioning; (H2a) the effect of Familias Unidas on cigarette use will be partially mediated by family functioning and (H3a) the effect of Familias Unidas on unprotected sexual behavior will be partially mediated by family functioning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of the proposed study is to reduce illicit drug use, cigarette use, and unsafe sexual behavior health disparities in Hispanic populations. The knowledge expected to be gained from this study will aid in the development of effective interventions to reduce drug use, cigarette use, unprotected sexual behavior, and HIV in Hispanic adolescents.

"Research Training in the Prevention of Drug Abuse & AIDS in Communities of Color    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised application for a MIDARP program at Howard University describes a mentoring program in drug abuse research and AIDS prevention in communities of color, which is designed to increase the capacity of faculty and students at Howard to conduct rigorous and competitive research in the prevention of drug abuse and HIV/AIDS in communities of color. The program will emphasize training in transdisciplinary research on relationships between environmental stress, biological responses, risk behaviors and health outcomes and will utilize collaborations with senior investigators in research intensive universities to mentor Howard faculty investigators. The MIDARP will also work closely with existing programs that link Howard faculty and students to research training opportunities to (1) increase knowledge and interest in drug abuse and AIDS prevention research among faculty and students in these programs and (2) utilize the resources of these programs to expand the range of training opportunities available to MIDARP investigators and students. Howard students will be introduced to drug abuse and AIDS prevention research and career development by augmenting existing drug abuse courses in the College of Arts and Sciences and the curriculum for medical, basic science, nursing, and pharmacy students to include information on drug abuse and AIDS prevention research. They will also fund a pre-doctoral dissertation stipend and recruit students to serve as research assistants in the MIDARP pilot studies. The unique strengths of the program include the opportunity to (1) integrate education regarding drug abuse and AIDS prevention research into existing research training programs for faculty and students;(2) train individuals in diverse disciplines such as the health professions and sciences (i.e., medicine, basic sciences, pharmacy, nursing) who are less likely to pursue research careers in drug abuse and AIDS prevention research; and (3) support transdisciplinary research in drug use and AIDS prevention based on strong existing university research programs in genetics, physiology, and psychobiology. A transdisciplinary approach will be reflected in the MIDARP leadership that includes a Director who is a behavioral scientist specializing in research on environmental stress, drug use, and AIDS risk in communities of color and a Deputy Director who is an immunogeneticist with expertise in microbiology, and founding Director of the Human Genome Project at Howard University.          ",Research Training in the Prevention of Drug Abuse & AIDS in Communities of Color,7891185,R24DA021470,"['recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Science ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Sociology ', ' Knowledge ', ' lectures ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Medical Students ', ' Nursing Students ', ' Pupil Nurses ', ' Pharmacy Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Scientist ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Award ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' graduate student ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' career development ', ' psychobiology ', ' biopsychology ', ' biological basis of behavior ', ' response ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' heart rate variability ', ' Consultations ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Ally ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Electronic Mail ', ' Email ', ' E-Mail ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Allied Health Sciences ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' Training and Infrastructure ', ' Monitor ', ' Authorization documentation ', ' Permission ', ' Authorization ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Behavioral ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' Foundations ', ' base ', ' career ', ' role model ', ' sociology/anthropology ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Occupations ', ' health science profession ', ' Health Professions ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human Genome Project ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Leadership ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Measurement ', ' Development Plans ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Funding ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Microbiology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nurses ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Genetic ', ' Physiology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Exposure to ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Psychology ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' ']",NIDA,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,R24,2010,804585,0.15242078635463338
"Randomized Trial of IFCBT-HIVPI to Prevent HIV Among Non-Injection Drug Users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a second revision of a competitive renewal R01 proposal of the NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study in response to NIDA PAS-07-115 (Non-injection Dug Abuse and HIV/AIDS). The primary study aim is to evaluate the ability of Integrated Family and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy-HIV Prevention Intervention (IFCBT-HIVPI) to prevent HIV among adult non-injection and injection drug users. Over a 12 week intervention interval, the IFCBT-HIVPI model coordinates the delivery of cognitive- behavioral components during 12 group sessions with a couples and family systems component during 4 couples/family sessions to address HIV risk and protective factors across multiple ecological systems. IFCBT-HIVPI main effects on primary (HIV sexual risk behaviors and HIV drug taking risk behaviors) and secondary (HIV, Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis incidences and legal involvement, academic achievement, and employment) outcome domains will be evaluated. We also seek to elucidate the degree to which the development of attitudinal and behavior change skills targeted by IFCBT-HIVPI (e.g., rational beliefs, problem solving skill, adaptive couples' communication) result in post-intervention reductions of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and HIV risk behaviors. The possibility of effect-modification is also considered with a focus on route of drug administration status (i.e., non-injector/injector), neuropsychological (e.g., executive function), and demographic (i.e., African American/white) factors. The proposed study will randomly assign 360 HIV-negative non-injection and injection drug users recruited from the original NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study sample to experimental (IFCBT-HIVPI) and comparison (Brief Psychoeducation Curriculum on HIV Prevention; BPEC-HIV) conditions. The composition of the original NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study sample provides the basis to stratify the randomized trial sample across gender and two race/ethnicity (i.e., African American and white) groups by route of drug administration status. An assessment battery comprised of a standardized interview on HIV risk behavior, neuropsychological tests, tools to assess attitudes and behavior change skills targeted by IFCBT-HIVPI, drug and STI urine testing, and serologic tests of HIV will be administered before, during, and after the intervention interval across 18-month post-intervention follow-up. Additional preliminary analyses will be conducted on the randomized trial data to: (1) derive session-by-session measures on mechanisms of change targeted by IFCBT-HIVPI via videotape coding methods; (2) characterize mechanisms of change trajectories that may then be evaluated as plausible intervention moderators if present; and (3) estimate intervention cost-effectiveness. The lack of research on science-based prevention interventions for HIV continues to be a serious gap in the literature with recent HIV trends highlighting significant health disparities, particularly among African American non-injection drug users. If successful, the proposed project should help to identify specific attitudinal and behavior change skills targeted by cognitive- behavioral and couples/family systems interventions that foster subsequent reductions in HIV, STIs and HIV risk behaviors among adult drug users at heightened disease risk. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent estimates suggest that a majority of the 40,000 new cases of HIV reported annually in the US are attributable largely to sexual risk behavior associated with non-injection drug use. Additionally, African American drug users exhibit substantial HIV health disparities with African American females being 21 times more likely to contract HIV than white females. The proposed project is designed to address critical gaps in the HIV prevention science field by evaluating the ability of an intervention coordinating cognitive-behavioral and couples/family systems components to prevent HIV among adult drug users at heightened disease risk.           PROJECT NARRATIVE.

"Factors for enhanced neurotoxicity in methamphetamine abuse in HIV infection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted in response to PAR-09-011 Diversity-promoting Institutions Drug Abuse Research Program (DIDARP) requested by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). This proposed research program is timely since it focuses on two ofthe major health disparity issues in Hawaii, namely, methamphetamine abuse and HIV infection. Recent surveys indicate that Native Hawaiians or other Pacific islanders have the highest rate of methamphetamine use among persons aged 12 or older in the United States. Although HIV/AIDS infection rate is relatively low in Hawaii compared to other major metropolis, the rates are increasing among Hawaiians. This DIDARP will include two primary and one pilot research projects that will focus on mechanisms and factors that might enhance neurotoxicity associated with methamphetamine of HIV. We aim to enhance the capacity for drug abuse research at UH by creating this small translational research team. This group will take advantage and build on the expertise of the few but outstanding existing clinical drug abuse and HIV researchers and basic scientists. We aim to enable UH to develop a strong clinical and translational drug abuse research program. To complement these projects, we additionally propose training and career development activities that wil offer exciting opportunities for DIDARP investigators and others at UH through the Administrative and Training Core. The Faculty in the Core will provide guidance and mentorship for these junior faculty and graduate students, through infrastructure support, educational courses, seminars, and a dedicated DIDARP website, We have obtained institutional support for two additional graduate students for the program. We also have recruited 4 distinguished External Advisory Committee members with expertise related to the proposed research; each has enthusiastically agreed to provide their advice and letter of support for the development of this DIDARP at UH.

"Social networks and HIV risk among rural drug users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is in response to PA-06-478, ""Research on Rural Mental Health and Drug Abuse Disorders"". One of the research areas highlighted by this PA is the examination of rural HIV transmission using social network analysis. The overall goal of the study is to examine the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors for HIV and other blood borne infections (BBIs) such as hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) among rural Appalachian drug users using social network analysis and multilevel modeling. HIV continues to be a major public health problem in the United States, especially among drug users. However, little is known about HIV in rural areas in which there are marked health disparities. Therefore, given that studies among urban drug users have found that social network indicators are robust predictors of HIV risk, both social network and individual characteristics will be measured for their association with HIV risk among rural drug users. The specific aims are: 1) To determine the prevalence and incidence of HIV, HCV and HBV among rural injection and non- injection drug users; 2) To examine HIV and other BBI risk among rural injection and non-injection drug users; and 3) To examine longitudinal changes in rural HIV, HCV and HBV risk at 6-months, 12-months and 18- months post-baseline. To meet these aims, a sample 500 rural injection and non-injection drug users will be recruited using respondent driven sampling (RDS). In addition to biologic testing for HIV, HCV and HBV, rural participants will be given an interviewer-administered questionnaire pertaining to their social networks (drug, sexual and support networks), sociodemographics, drug use, HIV risk behaviors, psychiatric diagnoses, intravention and norms. Since individuals will be nested within networks, data will be analyzed using multilevel random effects regression that allows for the simultaneous examination of social network and individual-level risk. Consistent with the priorities of the NIDA AIDS Research Program, this proposal will explore the social network structure in a rural drug using population in order to better understand how network factors may affect HIV risk in rural areas using an innovative multilevel approach. Results from the proposed study will inform the design and implementation of HIV interventions in rural areas and help to determine the appropriate population for which to target such activities in order to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV and other BBIs.       Although HIV remains a significant public health problem in the United States, especially among drug users, little is known about HIV risk in rural areas such as Appalachia. It has been shown in urban populations that relationships among drug users, also known as social networks, are important predictors of HIV risk. Therefore, this study seeks to characterize rural HIV risk by measuring both social network and individual behaviors in order to inform prevention activities in health resource-deprived rural areas.          ",Social networks and HIV risk among rural drug users,7765565,R01DA024598,"['Urban Population ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Behavior ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' meetings ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Seroprevalences ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Measures ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Epidemic ', ' Social Network ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Affect ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health Resources ', ' Hepatitis B ', ' serum hepatitis ', ' infection with hepatitis B virus ', ' infection with HBV ', ' Viral Hepatitis B ', ' Hepatitis B Infection ', ' Hepatitis B Virus ', ' Homologous Serum Hepatitis Virus ', ' HBV ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non-A non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non A non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis nonA nonB ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' PT-NANBH ', ' Non-B Hepatitis Parenterally-Transmitted Non-A ', ' NANBH ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Area ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Interviewer ', ' Interview ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' HCV ', ' Kentucky ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Respondent ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug user ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rural Population ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachia ', ' Serologic tests ', ' serology ', ' Serological Tests ', ' Individual Adjustment ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Research Priority ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2010,627278,0.12666251430322556
"Understanding Racial Disparities in Teen Methamphetamine Use Despite a voluminous number of studies documenting the nature and extent of teen methamphetamine use in the United States, relatively few studies have provided a comprehensive portrait of the risk and protective factors associated with adolescent meth use. One salient omission is the lack of studies that provide insight into the well-documented race gap in teen methamphetamine use: Native American teens are at much greater risk of use and abuse of methamphetamines than non-Hispanic whites. This fact is exacerbated by evidence that meth use is associated with a heightened risk of engaging in behaviors such as IV drug use and unprotected sexual practices that are correlated with contracting HIV/AIDS. Indeed, research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides evidence that Native Americans are at a heightened risk of contracting HIV/AIDS relative to non-Hispanic whites. Clearly, there are important gaps in our knowledge and understanding of why methamphetamine use/abuse is distributed differentially among adolescents, and there is a need for research that specifically focuses on explaining the ""race-gap"" between Native American and non Hispanic white teens in America with regards to both meth use and the associations between meth use and behaviors associated with risk of exposure to HIV/AIDS. The present study, by addressing these knowledge gaps, will facilitate understanding into why the race gap in such behavior exists and can direct targeted intervention and prevention programs that address such health disparities between Native American and non-Hispanic white teens. The long-term goal of the research team is to continue to explore how racial and economic stratification serves to produce health disparities, in order to reduce race and economic based disparities. The objective of this application is threefold: a) to identify the social risk and protective factors associated with both meth use generally and those factors that serve to delineate racial/ethnic differences in use specifically; b) to apply the stress process model/General Strain Theory to expand our understanding of both meth use and racial differences in use; and c) to explore the association between meth use and risky sexual behaviors and how race serves as a potential moderator. The central hvpothesis of this application is that differences in stress exposure will predict both individual and race-based variation in meth use, abuse, and related risky behaviors (IV drug use/unprotected sex) with personal and social resources serving to moderate the stresssubstance use association. The plan is to fill this knowledge gap by pursuing the following two specific aims: a) utilize the stress process modei/GST framework to identify the social risk and protective factors associated with the initiation, use, and abuse/dependence of meth use among both males and females, non-Hispanic whites and Native American adolescents who attend public schools in Montana; and b) evaluate the stress process modei/GST framework as an explanation for predicting risky sexual practices and the potential role of race and meth use as moderators. In order to accomplish these objectives, one wave of data will be collected, entailing the use of a self-administered questionnaire of a targeted sample of approximately 900 ninth and tenth grade boys and girls attending three high schools in Montana. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide fundamental knowledge necessary in order to construct efficacious interventions and prevention efforts designed to reduce the adolescent Native American-white race gap in meth use, and risky behaviors associated with HIV/AIDS. This proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide fundamental knowledge necessary in order to construct efficacious interventions and prevention efforts designed to reduce the adolescent Native Americanwhite race gap in meth use, IV drug use and risky sexual behaviors associated with contracting HIVIAIDS. This research will provide a vertical step in understanding how the stress process modei/GST can be utilized to understand and redress racial differences in methamphetamine use and its association with risky behaviors (sexual and IV drug use) related to HIV/AIDS transmission and should facilitate additional research into understanding the Native American-white race gap in other substance use and related HIV/AIDS associated risk behaviors.

"Effect of Prescription Drug Benefits on Cardiovascular Outcomes in the Elderly  In 2006, the United States implemented the Medicare Modernization Act, which expanded prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries at an estimated cost of $768 billion dollars over the next decade. Improved access to drug benefits may improve cardiovascular outcomes for the elderly by providing financial access to effective therapy. However, there is limited research about the impact of prescription drug coverage on health outcomes. In addition, although black enrollees have been found to have markedly lower use of antihypertensive, lipid-lowering and anti-platelet medications, little is known about the role of prescription drug coverage as a mediator of racial and socioeconomic disparities in cardiovascular outcomes.             In this project, we will investigate the effect of prescription drug benefits on the use of appropriate secondary preventive medication and achievement of favorable clinical outcomes among Medicare managed care enrollees with cardiovascular disease. The project will also assess the role of prescription drug coverage in explaining racial and socioeconomic disparities in cardiovascular outcomes.  Effective drugs, such as aspirin, beta-blockers, statins, and ace-inhibitors, are a cornerstone in the prevention and treatment of heart disease, yet over half of appropriate patients do not receive them. The cost of chronic drug therapy is a substantial barrier for elderly patients who have lower fixed incomes and sizable out-of- pocket spending on health care.

"Collaborative Research on Drug Abuse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This P01 develops and applies state-of-the-art methods to analyze existing but under-utilized drug abuse databases in collaboration with their owners. We address contemporary, theoretical, and applied issues in drug abuse research to understand intersections between substance abuse and AIDS risk behaviors as well as minority and gender-based health disparities. We work with dozens of investigators from drug & social policy, epidemiology, health sciences, medicine, nursing, psychiatry, psychology, public health, and social work who own exciting substance abuse data to develop models that test current theories, especially on epidemiology, prevention, intervention, and treatment of drug abuse, using modern multivariate methods to control for measurement errors, biases, and other confounds. The Models and Methods Project develops psychometric and statistical analytic techniques that hold special promise for improving the quality of drug abuse and AIDS research. The At-Risk Project studies substance abuse related data sets on vulnerable populations (substance abusers, homeless people, individuals who are HIV positive or who have AIDS, victims of domestic abuse, runaways, gang members, and others at high risk for AIDS or drug abuse) with methods to control sampling, measurement, distributional and other biases. The Community Project studies drug abuse etiology, adult consequences, HIV risk, intergenerational processes, general deviance, and related issues in large community-based samples, and develops and tests explanatory theories using models that permit separation of common from specific effects, control for artifacts, etc. The Core Project oversees and integrates all components, hosts visiting scholars, provides computer facilities, and sponsors a mentoring program for disadvantaged students. The substantive part of the Models Project and the At-Risk and Community Projects will be developing and testing integrative theories that can be applied across different populations. The findings from their studies will lead to greater understanding of precursors and concomitants of substance abuse and HIV/AIDS risk and transmission. In turn, these findings will guide development of effective interventions to reduce negative health outcomes and treatment disparities in community, ethnic, and vulnerable populations, and provide guidance on how these may be alleviated.     ",Collaborative Research on Drug Abuse,7910487,P01DA001070,[''],NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P01,2010,1046164,0.06373110537308126
"Targeting HIV Risk Behaviors in Juvenile Drug Court-Involved Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overriding purpose of this study is to develop and test an intervention for reducing substance use and risky sexual behaviors among youth involved in juvenile drug court. Juvenile drug court provides an excellent setting in which to pursue the key study objectives by providing access to a well identified high risk population. Second, in addition to frequent judicial oversight, juvenile drug courts include several features that can enhance intervention effectiveness, sustainability, and potential for adoption. In addition, the fact that all juvenile drug courts have community-based treatment components and that such courts have been disseminated nationwide suggests the possibility of eventual widespread adoption if the proposed intervention is effective. The proposed intervention integrates evidence-based protocols for contingency management (CM) for substance abusing youth and family engagement strategies, with an evidence-informed family systems intervention for sexual risk originally developed to address substance use and sexual risk behaviors in HIV+ youth. These three interventions will be integrated into an efficient intervention that, if effective, can be amenable to adoption by juvenile drug courts. Following protocol development and beta testing, 160 drug court youth and their families will be randomized to the experimental intervention condition (HIV Risk Reduction or ""HRR"") versus Drug Court with Community Services (DC) conditions. Key outcomes will be assessed through 12-months post-baseline using a multi-method approach that will include assessment of substance use, risky sexual behaviors, criminal behavior, and participation in HIV counseling and testing services. Specific aims include: 1: Adapt existing intervention and training protocols into a single, efficient HRR intervention, beta test this HHR protocol with four youth in juvenile drug court and their families, and revise treatment and research protocols accordingly; 2: Conduct a randomized trial with 160 youth in juvenile drug court and their families to examine youth-level intervention effects (i.e., on substance use, sexual risk behavior, HIV counseling and testing, delinquent behavior) in comparison to DC through 12- months post referral and assess intervention fidelity. 3. If results suggest a positive HRR treatment effect, revise the intervention and training protocols in preparation for an effectiveness study and extended follow-up study. Importantly, the proposed study will (1) consider the multiple levels of influence on juvenile drug use, criminal justice involvement, and HIV risk behaviors, (2) integrate a drug abuse and HIV prevention intervention for youth in the criminal justice system with drug-related offenses, (3) address health disparities by targeting a primarily minority population of youth, and (4) increase referrals to HIV testing and counseling of drug court-involved youth. This study is designed to reduce HIV risk by addressing the potent interaction of drug use and risky sexual behaviors in drug court youth with evidence-based treatment components to maximize the likelihood of reversing these youths' adverse behavioral trajectories.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study is designed to gain knowledge about effective interventions for reducing HIV risk in a high risk population. Reducing HIV risk by effectively targeting substance use and risky sexual behaviors and by locating even a small number of HIV-positive youth could favorably impact society at multiple levels (individual, family, peer, community, fiscal).           PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is designed to gain knowledge about effective interventions for reducing HIV risk in a high risk population.

"Intensive Outpatient v. Outpatient Treatment with Buprenorphine among African Ame    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This application addresses broad Challenge Area (05): Comparative Effectiveness Research, and specific Challenge Topic (05-DA-104): Comparing Drug Treatment Effectiveness in Ethnic Minority Populations Background: Although there is relatively little difference in illicit drug use rates between African Americans and Whites, there is are significant differences in terms of the collateral impact of opiate use on these two communities and wide disparities in their access to treatment. Buprenorphine, a partial mu agonist approved for use the US in 2002 outside of strictly regulated opioid treatment programs, has the potential to reduce the disparity between demand for treatment and treatment access. However it appears from early data on the implementation of buprenorphine in the US that the health disparities faced by African Americans are now extending to this treatment. Indeed, according to SAMHSA over 90 percent of the patients receiving buprenorphine in their evaluation of this treatment were White. Many African Americans in urban areas are unable to find or afford the kind of buprenorphine physician office-based treatment that the approval of buprenorphine was intended to make possible. In Maryland and elsewhere, drug treatment agencies are responding to the disparities in access to buprenorphine treatment by offering grants or contracts to drug treatment programs that have traditionally relied exclusively on psychosocial approaches (""drug-free"" outpatient programs) to treatment. This arrangement has potential to ameliorate the access problem for African Americans, who in Baltimore make up about 80 percent of the city's heroin-using population. But this arrangement has also uncovered knowledge gaps that must be filled to enable both access and optimal patient centered treatment for this population. One such gap concerns what level of psychosocial treatment is appropriate for this population. Second, we need to understand how attitudes of staff at formerly abstinence-oriented programs affect the use of an opioid agonist in terms of retention in treatment and outcomes. Design: This two-group randomized clinical trial will test the effectiveness of intensive outpatient (IOP) v. standard outpatient (OP) treatment in 272 heroin-dependent African American adults receiving buprenorphine in 3 formerly ""drug-free"" programs. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment intensity conditions at intake and assessed at baseline, 3-, and 6-months post-baseline to determine treatment retention, frequency and severity of heroin and cocaine use, self-reported HIV-risk, quality of life, and to determine DSM-IV criteria for Full or Partial Remission of Opioid Dependence. Furthermore, patient factors potentially critical for treatment success (e.g., attitudes towards buprenorphine and average buprenorphine dose while in treatment) will be examined to determine their importance in influencing treatment outcomes. Moreover, both patient and staff attitudes and average buprenorphine dose will be evaluated to determine their respective relationships to treatment experiences and treatment retention. Significance, Innovation and Public Health Impact: This study is significant because it will examine the comparative effectiveness of two common counseling approaches offered with buprenorphine in clinics treating large numbers of African Americans, a population with significant need and limited access to this type of effective treatment. Study findings may help to expand the availability of buprenorphine to African Americans, inform providers and policymakers regarding the relative benefits of two levels of intensity of counseling, and inform the field regarding factors associated with optimal buprenorphine utilization and program retention. The use of the DSM-IV criteria for remission as a one of the outcome measures represents an important augmentation of the usual drug abuse research outcome measures, which usually rely primarily upon urine testing results and self-reports of drug use as the primary outcome measure and do not take into account drug- related reductions in clinically significant impairment or distress, despite some continued intermitted drug use. Public Health Statement This study will examine the comparative effectiveness of two common counseling approaches offered with buprenorphine in clinics treating large numbers of African Americans, a population with significant need and limited access to this type of effective treatment which reduces drug use and HIV-risk. Study findings may help to expand the availability of buprenorphine to African Americans, inform providers and policymakers regarding the relative benefits of two levels of intensity of counseling, and inform the field regarding factors associated with optimal buprenorphine utilization and program retention.               PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Statement This study will examine the comparative effectiveness of two common counseling approaches offered with buprenorphine in clinics treating large numbers of African Americans, a population with significant need and limited access to this type of effective treatment which reduces drug use and HIV-risk.

"The Logics for HIV Risk among Street-Based Heroin Injectors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a theoretically and ethnographically informed model of ""HIV risk environment"" for public health intervention by identifying the key structural forces, institutional processes, and socio-cultural constraints that shape HIV behaviors among inner-city street-based drug users. We will examine the social processes that drive the logics for HIV transmission behaviors among street-based injection drug users (IDUs) in two cities, Philadelphia and San Francisco, that span a strategic range of the demographic, economic, political, and cultural factors affecting inner-city poverty in the United States. Building on long-term, continuous participant-observation ethnographic fieldwork in the shooting encampments of ethnically and generationally bounded social networks of heroin injectors and crack smokers in San Francisco as well as pilot research in Philadelphia at open-air drug markets and shooting galleries, we will document patterns of: 1) law enforcement and criminal justice; 2) poverty and income generating opportunities (including legal and illegal labor markets and public subsidies); 3) illegal drug markets and polydrug availability; 4) racialized ethnic boundaries and conflicts; 5) gender/sexuality boundaries that delimit social networks; 6) oppositional sub-cultural identities that trap IDUs into counterproductive relationships with the services that are meant to help or contain them; 7) violence and insecurity; 8) access to clinical care, public health prevention messages, and social services; 9) access to ecological and basic survival needs infrastructures including transportation systems, food, and shelter from inclement weather. An experienced ethnographic team in both cities will collect data on individual-level HIV risk behaviors at fieldsites that we have successfully maintained on the parent grant for more than 12 years in San Francisco and recently established in Philadelphia (core N of each network=15-20 at any given time, peripheral N=10-15 in each fieldsite; 2 sites in Philadephia and 2 in San Francisco). The project will administer a set of procedures for cross-methodological collaboration with epidemiologists who are the Principal Investigators on long-term, large quantitative data sets documenting street-based drug users in both cities. This will enable us to examine the representativity of our ethnographic data on individual street-based drug users and to explore the generalizability of our analysis of the larger social structural processes that promote or constrain risky injection and sexual practices. It will also bring one of the largest and oldest NIDA-funded data sets on IDUs in San Francisco, an exceptionally high-tech, wealthy, culturally diverse, and liberal city into an illustrative contrast and dialogue with another large NIDA-supported quantitative data set of street-based drug users in the city of Philadelphia, one of the nation's poorest deindustrialized metropolises, with a declining population of largely native-born white, Latino (primarily Puerto Rican) and African American ethnic groups.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Untangling the complex web of factors that render inner city poverty environments exceptionally risky for HIV infection and addiction will help public health outreach workers and clinicians develop more innovative structural and targeted interventions to reach larger numbers of low income high-risk populations with more effective and convincing messages. Upstream interventions that alter neighborhood-level risk environments can cost-effectively encourage drug users to change their behaviors for pragmatic reasons without necessarily requiring a conscious or willful choice. Our findings will also identify strategic institutions and programs that often operate at cross purposes or fail to coordinate with public health HIV risk reduction priorities (including law enforcement, criminal justice, employment training, public housing, food kitchens, shelters, schools, and churches) but which represent productive sites for multi-service HIV prevention interventions.           Relevance: Untangling the complex web of factors that render inner city poverty environments exceptionally risky for HIV infection and addiction will help public health outreach workers and clinicians develop more innovative structural and targeted interventions to reach larger numbers of low income high-risk populations with more effective and convincing messages.

"Navigator Enhanced Case Management for Jail Inmates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year, there are over 600 unduplicated HIV-infected persons incarcerated in the San Francisco jail and almost two-thirds released with HIV-focused discharge planning were reincarcerated within 1 year. More than half of HIV-infected jail inmates are diagnosed with mental health conditions severe enough to require medication and a similar proportion report substance abuse disorders at the time of detention. While some community-based services exist, there remains a critical need exists to improve linkages to care and adherence to care plans for HIV-infected adults as they move between community and jai. An effective service delivery model used in similar high-needs populations exists, but has not been tested with HIV-infected drug users leaving jails - Navigator case management. Base on harm reduction, motivational interviewing and general social work principles, this model uses assertive community treatment and a highly proactive approach to facilitate adherence to a comprehensive care plan designed to address a client's multiple needs. Case managers work with paraprofessional peer navigators to help clients make better use of available resources, more effectively communicate with providers, sustain care over time and successfully connect with multiple service provider sectors. In this study, we propose to tailor this approach to meet the needs of HIV-infected individuals with substance abuse and mental health issues, pilot test the intervention and assessment procedures and then conduct a randomized study in which 360 HIV-infected men and women leaving jail. Specifically, participants will receive either Navigator case management delivered by the non-profit San Francisco Pre-Trial Diversion project or the standard of care currently provided to transitioning inmates, 90- days of as-needed case management provided by the San Francisco Department of Public Health's Forensic AIDS Project. We will test the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing sexual and drug-related HIV transmission risk, increasing HIV medication adherence, reducing drug dependence and reducing reincarceration. Finally, we will characterize both the Navigator and Forensic AIDS Project intervention processes and conduct exploratory analyses of the mediators of HIV transmission risk and risk reduction and HIV-related adherence among HIV+ individuals leaving jail. Our study is highly innovative because no interventions exist that are proven effective with this population - HIV-infected individuals with drug use and mental health issues. This study will also contribute to the field of HIV prevention by incorporating risk reduction counseling alongside more traditional case management support services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-infected adults incarcerated in the United States criminal justice system are predominantly active drug users and disproportionately people of color. The complex interplay of poverty, race, lack of education and sanctions--rather than treatment--for addictions reinforces returns to the criminal justice system and pervasive health disparities for HIV-infected individuals. Underlying behaviors that lead to repeated incarceration closely correlate with behaviors that are associated with HIV transmission and increased morbidity and mortality from HIV. In drug addicted adults, recidivism is driven by drug relapse and illegal activities associated with drug use, failure to engage and remain in mental health treatment or failure to break free from social instability in the form of homelessness and joblessness. This study proposes to assess whether a method of case management proven effective for similar populations can ensuring services to successfully and permanently break the cycle of incarceration, drug abuse and HIV transmission risk behavior among HIV-infected individuals leaving jail.              NARRATIVE HIV-infected adults incarcerated in the United States criminal justice system are predominantly active drug users and disproportionately people of color.

"DIDARP at the University of Puerto Rico School of Public Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to enhance our capacity to conduct drug abuse research with criminal justice populations from a public health perspective, at the University of Puerto Rico, Graduate School of Public Health. Our research development strategy centers on developing proficiency in research competencies in a critical mass of faculty that will cohesively pursue epidemiological and health services research relevant to engaging and retaining in community drug treatment re-entering inmates with histories of a substance use disorder. The program will provide as well opportunities to develop research capacity in students at different stages in their education and to encourage them to engage in drug abuse research careers. The research projects submitted with this application will explore individual and drug treatment provider factors that may predict entry and retention in community drug treatment for re-entering ex-offenders with a substance use problem. The proposed projects should contribute to address the disproportionate prevalence of untreated substance use problems in incarcerated populations as well as the large proportion of untreated ex-offenders that become re-addicted and who are re-incarcerated shortly after release The research projects include three pilot and one developmental project that address NIDA research priorities such as the services needs of special populations and studies of service providers. We expect MIDARP support to enhance our capacity to engage in NIH funded drug abuse research of relevance to addressing disparities borne by Latinos with a substance use disorder. To reach our goal, we have established the following aims: 1) Provide leadership, support, and coordination to increase the number of Latino faculty and students capable of successfully conducting drug abuse research relevant to a criminal justice context. 2) Enhance institutional and extra- institutional resources that sustain the successful planning, financing, and conduct of drug abuse research. 3) Disseminate research findings in a timely and effective fashion to the research community, to the academic programs, and to other stakeholders involved in addressing the drug treatment needs of ex- offenders with a substance use problem.

"Research Training in the Prevention of Drug Abuse & AIDS in Communities of Color This revised application for a MIDARP program at Howard University describes the Research Training Program in Drug Abuse and AIDS Prevention in Communities of Color which is designed to increase the capacity of faculty and students at Howard to conduct rigorous and competitive research in the prevention of drug abuse and HIV/AIDS in communities of color. The program will emphasize training in transdisciplinary research on relationships between environmental stress, biological responses, risk behaviors and health outcomes and will utilize collaborations with senior investigators in research intensive universities to mentor Howard faculty investigators. The MIDARP will also work closely with existing programs that link Howard faculty and students to research training opportunities to (1) increase knowledge and interest in drug abuse and AIDS prevention research among faculty and students in these programs and (2) utilize the resources of these programs to expand the range of training opportunities available to MIDARP investigators and students. Howard students will be introduced to drug abuse and AIDS prevention research and career development by augmenting existing drug abuse courses in the College of Arts and Sciences and the curriculum for medical, basic science, nursing, and pharmacy students to include information on drug abuse and AIDS prevention research.. We will also fund a pre-doctoral dissertation stipend and recruit students to serve as research assistants in the MIDARP pilot studies. The unique strengths of the program include the opportunity to (1) integrate education regarding drug abuse and AIDS prevention research into existing research training programs for faculty and students;(2) train individuals in diverse disciplines such as the health professions and sciences (i.e., medicine, basic sciences, pharmacy, nursing) who are less likely to pursue research careers in drug abuse and AIDS prevention research; and (3) support transdisciplinary research in drug use and AIDS prevention based on strong existing University research programs in genetics, physiology, and psychobiology. A transdisciplinary approach will be reflected in the MIDARP leadership that includes a Director who is a behavioral scientist specializing in research on environmental stress, drug use, and AIDS risk in communities of color and a Deputy Director who is an immunogeneticist with expertise in microbiology, and founding Director of the Human Genome Project at Howard University.

"Drugs, sexual impulsivity, HIV: Psychosocial and cognitive risk factors of YMSM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Unprotected sexual intercourse between men constitutes 58% of all reported cases of AIDS and 80% of HIV cases 1,2. Rates of HIV infection among 15 to 24 year olds continue to increase with MSM behavior remaining the leading cause of HIV infection among adolescent males 1,2. Over 90% of YMSM have reported having more than one sexual partner in the past 6 months and between 33% and 49% have had unprotected anal intercourse during the same time3. Studies show that use of stimulants, particularly methamphetamine, may influence risky sexual practices and contribute to the most recent wave of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)4-6. Systematic development of theory has been identified as a crucial step in efficacious intervention development, but previous conceptual models have focused on a relatively limited array of explanatory constructs. However, Social Action Theory (SAT)7 provides a promising model for examining the risk behavior of YMSM, because it includes individual as well as social and contextual determinants. SAT remains to be tested for use in the field of HIV and with YMSM, because this model was originally conceived as a general health promotion model for the adult population. Using data from the Dr. Kipke's NIDA funded ""Healthy Young Men Study"" (HYM), this study will conduct multivariate analysis to test this model for use with the YMSM population. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) To empirically validate the chain of relationships depicted in Social Action Theory to determine if the theory addresses the interaction of individual, contextual, and social correlates of sexual and drug risk taking behaviors as they relate to YMSM; and 2) To further validate SAT by testing and incorporating competing theoretical relationships depicted in other behavioral theory models to develop a comprehensive theory of the social, psychosocial and cognitive risk factors for drug use, sexual impulsivity, and HIV among YMSM to guide prevention intervention efforts. . This study will contribute to the objectives of the AIDS-Science Track Award for Research Transition by 1) supporting a New Researcher; 2) addressing the NIDA research objective in the area of HIV, drug abuse, impulsivity, and coping strategies of an at-risk, under represented population; and 3) through refinement of a comprehensive theoretical model, we will provide a platform for developing interventions that address risk behavior related to HIV transmission among YMSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will contribute to effective HIV interventions for at-risk youth by developing a model to understand how environmental risk factors, impulsivity, and coping strategies converge into drug abuse and sexual risk taking.

"African American Female Drug Users: HIV, Health Disparities, & Criminality The overall goal of this study is to understand how drug use and criminality are related to health disparities, particularly HIV, and service utilization among African American drug using and non-drug using women across criminal justice status. While drug use is similar across racial groups in the US, African Americans are disproportionately more likely to experience severe health consequences and criminal involvemement as a result of drug misuse. Adequate health care may not be received by African American female offenders because they experience the burden of their race, class, gender, and criminal offender status. There is limited scientific data to help understand the linkages between health disparities such as HIV, untreated drug abuse, barriers to service utilization, and status as a criminial offender among African American females. This study is significant because of its potential to identify differences in health disparities and service utilization among African American drug using and non-drug using women in selected levels of criminal justice status (intensive correctional supervision-prison (n=200), moderate correctional supervision-jail (n=200), community supervision-probation (n=200), and no criminal justice involvement (n=200)). All 800 African American females will be followed logitudinally for three 6-month intervals to examine health status and the use of health services across time. The specific aims are: (1) To describe the prevalence of health problems among African American women across criminal justice status and drug use status; (2) To determine the cultural, predisposing, historical health, and potential enabling factors that are predictors of health problems among African American drug using and non-drug using women across criminal justice status over 18 months; (3) To describe the prevalence of untreated health problems, the patterns of health services utilization, and the cultural barriers to service utilization among African American women across criminal justice status and drug use status; and (4) To examine the factors that predict the likelihood of using health services among African American drug using and non-drug using women across criminal justice status over 18 months. The significance of this study includes the potential to provide criminal justice systems-level data for health planning and health policy for prevention, intervention, and treatment of African American female drug users. This study is significant to the public health field because of its potential to understand the severity of health disparities among African American women across criminal justice status and drug use status and to predict health status and the use of health services over time. This knowledge of African American females can be used as a foundation for future criminal justice systems-level interventions to increase the use of preventative health care and subsequently reduce the need for expensive medical services, as well as to decrease HIV risk behaviors including drug use, unprotected sex, and recidivism.

"Drug Use Among Hispanic Emerging Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among Hispanic adolescents, cultural factors such as acculturation, perceived discrimination, and acculturative stress are risk factors for drug use. Previous studies suggest that the effects of acculturation on drug use may be mediated by family functioning; when adolescents acculturate more rapidly than their parents, the parent- child acculturation discrepancy can lead to breakdowns in family communication and cohesion and increases in family conflict, which in turn can lead to risky behaviors such as drug use among the adolescents. Although there is considerable information about the role of family acculturation patterns in drug use among Hispanic adolescents, we do not know how family acculturation patterns affect adolescents as they transition into the next stage of life, emerging adulthood. Emerging adulthood, a provisional stage in which young adults try out adult roles but may not become firmly entrenched in them, is characterized by identity exploration, residential instability, self-focus, a subjective feeling of being between adolescence and true adulthood, and increased opportunities. In general, individuals who navigate this transition smoothly emerge with a more developed sense of identity, successful interpersonal relationships, new life roles, and minimal levels of substance use. However, the high level of independence and low level of social constraints that occur during emerging adulthood also make this a high-risk period for drug use and other problem behaviors. Understanding how factors in adolescence affect drug use in early adulthood can lead to better intervention efforts for adolescents. More research is needed to determine how cultural factors influence the transition to emerging adulthood among Hispanics and to identify the risk factors for escalation of drug use during this pivotal transition. This continuation application proposes to follow an established cohort of Hispanic adolescents (12th graders in the 2008-2009 school year) for an additional 4 years to identify the predictors of their drug use trajectories during the transition to emerging adulthood. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are the following: (1) Conduct an additional 4 annual surveys of the participants; (2) Construct individual growth curves to describe their use of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs; (3) Identify the predictors of the growth curve parameters, including cultural factors, peer factors, substance use during high school, psychological factors, and demographic factors; (4) Evaluate emerging adulthood variables as potential mediators of these influences, including identity exploration, experimentation / possibilities, instability (residential mobility, role transitions), self-focus, and subjective experience of being in-between adolescence and adulthood; and (5) Make recommendations for the development of improved health education messages to prevent drug use among acculturating Hispanics during the transition to emerging adulthood.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application addresses the public health goals of preventing and reducing substance use among young adults. It also aims to reduce health disparities by identifying risk and protective factors that are specific to Hispanics.           This application addresses the public health goals of preventing and reducing substance use among young adults.

"Economic Evaluation of Drug Abuse Treatment and HIV Prevention Services for Pregn    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Economic evaluation of drug abuse treatment and HIV prevention services for pregnant women is critical to identify the most efficient and equitable use of scarce resources. Economic and policy research on the efficiency of drug abuse treatment and HIV prevention services among vulnerable populations such as women, adolescents and members of minority groups is necessary to improve drug abuse and HIV/AIDS services for these vulnerable and underserved populations. While work in this area continues to grow, there is still a dearth of rigorous economic evaluations of such programs, especially those that adhere to quality standards as recommended by the U.S. Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. The overall objective of this study is to conduct the first economic evaluation of an innovative behavioral approach integrating Motivational Enhancement Therapy with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET-CBT) as compared to standard Brief Advice (BA) within prenatal care to decrease use of a full range of substances (e.g., marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines, alcohol, nicotine), to reduce HIV risk behavior and to achieve better infant health outcomes (e.g. longer gestations, greater birth weight, reduced medical consequences such as admission and length of stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)). The specific aims of this study are: (1) to conduct cost analyses of the MET-CBT and BA intervention arms; (2) to conduct incremental cost-effectiveness analyses of the two interventions (MET-CBT and BA), vis-`-vis each other, in terms of substance use, infant health outcomes and HIV risk reduction; and (3) to conduct incremental cost-utility analyses determining the net cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) saved respectively by each intervention arm (MET-CBT and BA), vis-`-vis each other, in terms of substance use and HIV risk reduction. The proposed research is responsive to PA-07-122 in that it proposes to conduct research related to cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses, services costs, methodological research, and the cross-cutting themes of HIV/AIDS and health disparities. The proposed research is grounded in sound microeconomic principles and standardized techniques as reported in the U.S. Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine, and proposes rigorous conceptual and methodological research to improve the evidence base on the unit costs and cost-effectiveness of substance abuse treatment and HIV prevention services. It builds on a NIDA-funded randomized controlled trial (R01-DA019135) of an innovate behavioral approach, which offers a new paradigm of treatment services, integrating MET-CBT within prenatal care compared to standard BA, and offering promise to improve access to and strengthen substance use treatment and HIV prevention services targeted at drug using pregnant women who are highly susceptible to HIV/AIDS.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug abuse and high risk HIV behavior during pregnancy are major public health problems in the United States due to their impact on individual users, their offspring, and surrounding communities. Drug abuse and HIV prevention programs targeting pregnant women have the potential to be cost-effective due to the resultant fewer low-birth-weight babies and perinatal deaths, fewer physical, cognitive and behavioral problems during infancy and childhood, and the significant health benefits that can accrue to the mother. The overall objective of this study is to conduct the first economic evaluation of an innovative behavioral approach integrating Motivational Enhancement Therapy with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET-CBT) as compared to standard Brief Advice (BA) within prenatal care to decrease use of a full range of substances (e.g., marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines, alcohol, nicotine), to reduce HIV risk behavior and to achieve better infant health outcomes (e.g. longer gestations, greater birth weight, reduced medical consequences such as admission and length of stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)).           PROJECT NARRATIVE Drug abuse and high risk HIV behavior during pregnancy are major public health problems in the United States due to their impact on individual users, their offspring, and surrounding communities.

"Linking State Data to Identify Unmet Need for Drug Treatment in Women Aged 15-49    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug treatment programs know who they serve, but can only estimate who they do not serve; the inability to accurately measure unmet treatment need, especially among women of reproductive age, is a key barrier to developing interventions to reduce drug-related health consequences for women, their children, and society. This proposal describes an innovative collaboration to link two existing independent state data systems to create a new, unique longitudinal, epidemiologic database that combines drug treatment data with hospital utilization and health outcomes data, to broadly identify drug-related problems and the prevalence of unmet treatment need, and to track drug-related health outcomes among Massachusetts women of reproductive age and their children. For the first time, women in need of drug treatment services who did not receive them will be individually identifiable, allowing for better estimation and description of unmet need. The new linked data will permit assessment of disparities among women with met and unmet treatment need through multiple sources of data, including using a tested algorithm to identify drug diagnoses in hospital data. Moreover, the linked data will allow the examination of subsequent health outcomes among women ages 15-49, and birth outcomes among their children. The two data sources to be linked are: (1) the population-based MA Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal (PELL) data system that includes vital records (births, fetal deaths and deaths); hospital discharge, observational stay, and emergency department visit records; and the MA Birth Defects Registry; and (2) the MA Bureau of Substance Abuse Services (BSAS) treatment data system that contains treatment records for over 25,000 annual admissions of women of reproductive age to BSAS-funded substance abuse treatment facilities. The three broad study aims are: 1. Link PELL data to the MDPH-BSAS Treatment Database and verify linkages. 2. Develop and pilot methods a) among all MA women of reproductive age, identify women with drug abuse or dependence (2002-2007), assess unmet need for treatment services, and characterize disparities in treatment use; b) among MA women who had deliveries (2003-2006), describe the pattern of identification and treatment of drug problems in the periods before, during, and after pregnancy, assess unmet need for drug treatment by timing, and characterize pregnancy outcomes; and c) among MA women with an identified drug problem develop preliminary multivariate models with predisposing and enabling factors predicting receipt of treatment, and, among women who delivered, risk for prematurity. 3. Develop an R01 proposal to describe the impact of substance abuse and treatment on women's and children's health, based on bivariate and multivariate analyses proposed for this study and a tandem NIH/NIAAA study.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This innovative public-private collaboration links two existing independent state data systems (BSAS and PELL) to create a new, unique longitudinal and epidemiologic database that combines drug treatment data with hospital utilization and health outcomes data, to broadly identify drug-related problems and the prevalence of unmet treatment need, and to track drug-related health and birth outcomes among Massachusetts women of reproductive age.

"Drug Policy, Incarceration, Community Re-entry, and Race Disparities in HIV/AIDS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a revision of an application submitted last year in response to PAR-07-379, ""Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Disparities."" We will analyze the interconnections between coercive mobility (the massive migration between the criminal justice [CJ] system and the community) produced by US drug policies and race disparities in HIV-related sexual risk among a sample of drug offenders in Connecticut (CT). Further, we will examine whether the association between coercive mobility (CM) and HIV-related sexual risk is affected by the degree of social disorganization in the communities in which these offenders reside. We also will study the feasibility of recruiting and following sexual partners of these individuals to better understand the impacts of CM on partners' HIV-related risk. We hypothesize that CM produces race disparities in HIV risk in a number of distinct ways: 1) Blacks are more likely than Whites to be incarcerated, so HIV-related sexual risk associated with CM can produce race disparities in HIV risk even if the effects of CM are the same for both Blacks and Whites; 2) Blacks are more likely than Whites to reside in communities experiencing the disorganizing impacts of CM, so to the extent that social disorganization exacerbates the effects of CM, it will affect the HIV risks of Blacks to a greater degree than Whites; 3) The sexual partners of Blacks are more likely to come from these same socially disorganized communities, furthering the negative impacts of CM for both returning inmates and their partners, and contributing to race disparities in HIV risk among women; and 4) Blacks are more likely to be penalized by drug policies in ways that increase their movement between prison/jail and the community and their vulnerability to its associated harms. We also hypothesize that we will be able to recruit and retain the sexual partners of study participants and conduct exploratory analyses of the impact of CM on their HIV-related sexual risk. An active Community Advisory Board including policymakers and program administrators will assist us in identifying structural interventions to reduce race disparities in HIV based on study findings.

"Incarceration Effects on Prevention of Drug Use, STI-HIV and Recidivism Incarcerated women are often affected by childhood abuse, violence, and other difficult life circumstances throughout their life course, and typically come from disproportionately disadvantaged neighborhoods. However, relatively less research has examined how neighborhood characteristics and incarceration interact with inmates' risk factors. Although several criminal justice studies demonstrated that excessive incarceration may exacerbate community disadvantages and instability as a large proportion of residents constantly move between jail and community, the impact of neighborhood disadvantages on inmates' health outcomes, such as drug use and sexual risks have not been examined. Furthermore, while the rate of female incarceration has steadily increased over the past 20 years, previous studies predominantly concern with men, and women's unique life trajectories of incarceration, sexual risks, and drug use have been less understood. The study proposes to examine the impact and consequences of incarceration on the patterns of substance use, risky sexual behaviors, and recidivism among female inmates who are returning to the community from a large urban jail. The proposed conceptual model will be tested explaining the ecological factors associated with incarceration, and the impact of incarceration on drug use, STls/HlV risks, and recidivism among female inmates. To achieve the objectives, the proposed study will conduct: 1) qualitative in-depth interviews with women in jail exploring their experience with incarceration, changes in social networks and support, health  concerns, health care and social services utilization, expected challenges upon release, and needs for successful transition to community life; 2) face-to-face longitudinal surveys with a cohort of female inmates at three time points (baseline in jail, and two weeks and three months post-release) to examine primary outcomes (relapse to drug use, risks for STIs/HlV infection, recidivism), secondary outcomes, and mediators (social network, social support); and 3) multi-level analysis and mapping to explore the effects of neighborhood disadvantage and instability, the rates of incarceration and STIs on women's outcomes. Incarcerated women are often from the poor, minority, urban populations who are most affected by drug  abuse and HIV. The rate of female incarceration has dramatically increased in recent years, while the  majority of them return to the community along with their health problems. Findings of the research wilt help  better understand incarcerated women's complex health, socioeconomic issues and community context,  which may contribute to reducing health disparities among women living in disadvantaged neighborhoods.","Incarceration Effects on Prevention of Drug Use, STI-HIV and Recidivism",7925645,R00DA024012,"['drug abuse prevention ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Employment ', ' Social Network ', ' Jail ', ' Data ', ' Social Health Services ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Affect ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Maps ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Poverty ', ' Prisoner ', ' jail inmate ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' Probability ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Life ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urban Population ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' recidivism ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' offender ', ' criminal offender ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Child Abuse ', ' Childhood Abuse ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Modeling ', ' Communities ', ' human capital ', ' reincarceration ', ' Minority ', ' community living ', ' Outcome ', ' Alcohol dependence ', ' alcohol-dependent ', ' alcohol dependency ', ' alcohol addiction ', ' service utilization ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R00,2010,246507,0.08478374343868396

"Trajectories of Drugs Abuse in High Risk Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the Northwestern Juvenile Project to examine the dynamic relationships among patterns of drug use and disorder, risk and protective factors for drug use and disorder, and adult social role performance as juvenile justice youth age from adolescence to emerging adulthood and young adulthood. This study responds to NIDA's new initiatives on drug abuse, health disparities, and disproportionate minority confinement of African Americans. At year-end 2004, nearly 100,000 juveniles and nearly 2.1 million adults were incarcerated. African Americans comprise 12% of the US population but 40% of incarcerated populations. We are studying a racially/ethnically diverse sample (n=1709; 624 females, 1085 males) in Cook County (Chicago) Illinois, aged 10-18 years at recruitment (1995-1998). Youth are reinterviewed whether they are (re)incarcerated or back in the community. Our goal is to focus on gender differences, racial/ethnic disparities, and the effect of incarceration as we: (1) describe patterns of drug use and disorder --onset, persistence, desistence, and recurrence - as juvenile justice youth age from adolescence to emerging and young adulthood; (2) examine how risk and protective factors (e.g., comorbid mental disorders, adverse life events, availability of illicit drugs) predict, moderate, and mediate patterns of drug use and disorders; and (3) examine the dynamic relationships between patterns of drug use and disorder and adult social role performance (e.g., residential independence [including avoiding incarceration], employment, marriage, parenting, desistance from crime and violence). To analyze the longitudinal data, we will use summary statistics (e.g., prevalence rates, odds ratios), generalized linear mixed-effects models, survival analyses, and Muthen's recently developed extensions of growth mixture models. Extending the Northwestern Juvenile Project allows us to leverage the data already collected to examine the role of incarceration in the development of drug use and disorder, especially among African Americans; to identify risk and protective factors that are potentially malleable; to identify points of intervention at key developmental periods; and to extend theoretical models - developed in general population adolescents -- to correctional populations.           ",Trajectories of Drugs Abuse in High Risk Youth,7903981,R01DA019380,"['Employment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', '

"HIV Infection in Ethnic Minority IDUs: An International Systematic Review    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial/ethnic group disparities in HIV/AIDS are a critical public health issue in the US. These disparities are particularly dramatic with respect to injecting drug use. African-Americans constitute 13% of the US population and 52% of recent US injecting drug use AIDS cases; Hispanics constitute 14% of the US population and 24% of the injecting drug use AIDS cases. These disparities are not the result of more injecting drug users among African-Americans and Hispanics, but of higher rates of HIV infection among African- American and Hispanic IDUs in many areas of the country. Similar disparities-higher rates of HIV infection among ethnic minority IDUs-have also been observed in many foreign countries. Indeed the situation of ethnic minority IDUs in some developing countries can be considered a crisis, with extremely high incidence, prevalence and HIV-related mortality. Disparities have also been observed among non-injecting drug users, with ethnic minority group members having higher rates of HIV infection. The logical next step for addressing these disparities and this epidemiological conundrum is not another individual study, but a systematic review of the large number of relevant studies that have been conducted to date. Our proposed systematic review will use state-of-the-art methods and include the US and the international data on ethnic group differences in HIV infection among drug users. The specific aims include: Developing procedures for combining qualitative and quantitative data from multiple research studies of IDUs in a single geographic area into a ""history of the HIV epidemic among IDUs"" in that area. Determining the frequency of HIV epidemics in which substantial differences in HIV infection have and have not arisen in ethnic minority IDUs vs. ethnic majority IDUs in the US and internationally. Identifying potential causal factors that may generate substantial differences in HIV prevalence among racial/ethnic minority vs. ethnic majority IDUs. Identifying potential causal factors that may perpetuate or reduce differences in HIV infection among racial/ethnic differences over time. Identifying epidemiologic situations in which differences in HIV risk behaviors do or do not statistically ""explain"" differences in HIV infection among racial/ethnic groups of IDUs. The research will also create an extremely rich dataset on HIV infection among ethnic drug uses that will be made available for use by other researchers and HIV prevention service providers. The research addresses one of the most important aspects of HIV/AIDS-the frequent large disparities in HIV infection among ethnic groups in the US and in many other countries. The research will be an innovative application of state of the art methods for systematic review, including extensive searching for published and unpublished studies, quantitative coding of research reports, and applying meta-regression/hierarchical modeling to these problems.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Higher rates of HIV infection among African-American and Hispanic IDUs are a major health disparity in the US. African-Americans comprise 13% of the US population and 52% of injection drug use AIDS cases, Hispanics 14% of the populations and 24% of cases. Similar disparities, higher rates of HIV infection among ethnic minority IDUs, have also been observed in many foreign countries. An international systematic review and meta-analysis should greatly advance our understanding of these disparities and suggest how they might be ameliorated.          ",HIV Infection in Ethnic Minority IDUs: An International Systematic Review,7901007,R01DA024612,"['Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' repository ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' sex risk ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' user-friendly ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' non-drug ', ' nondrug ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ethnic group ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Europe ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Procedures ', ' Health Services Needs ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non-A non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non A non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis nonA nonB ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' PT-NANBH ', ' Non-B Hepatitis Parenterally-Transmitted Non-A ', ' NANBH ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' systematic review ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Incidence ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Individual ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Glare ', ' North America ', ' Drug user ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Arts ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Asia ', ' Time ', ' Australia ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' Services ', ' prevention service ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' ']",NIDA,BETH ISRAEL MEDICAL CTR (NEW YORK),R01,2010,549319,0.06950887935870406
"Familias Unidas Stage III Study: Preventing Substance Abuse in Hispanic Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study's overarching goal is to reduce the ethnic disparities in illicit drug use, cigarette use, and HIV between Hispanic and non-Hispanic youth. This goal will be accomplished by four aims: AIM 1 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Practice (i.e., standard prevention services), in preventing illicit drug use; AIM 2 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Control, in preventing cigarette use; AIM 3 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Control, in preventing unprotected sexual behavior; and AIM 4 is to assess the extent to which family functioning mediates the effects of the intervention on illicit drug use, cigarette use, and unprotected sexual behavior. Twenty four middle schools with a total sample of 744 Hispanic adolescents from a wide geographic area of Miami-Dade County will be randomized using a block design to one of two conditions: Familias Unidas or Community Practice. The Familias Unidas intervention has been evaluated and found to be efficacious in two separate randomized controlled trials. In the first study (Pantin et al., 2003), Familias Unidas was shown to be efficacious relative to a no intervention control condition in increasing family functioning and reducing behavior problems (Prado et al., 2006), risk factors for youth illicit drug use and unprotected sex. In the second randomized controlled trial (Prado et al., in press), Familias Unidas was found to be efficacious, relative to two attention control conditions, in preventing cigarette use and illicit drug use. Familias Unidas was also found to be efficacious relative to both of the control conditions in preventing/reducing unprotected sexual behavior at last sexual intercourse. Finally, family functioning was found to mediate the effects of intervention condition on the outcomes. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) will be used to test: (H1) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing illicit drug use over time; (H2) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing cigarette use over time; and (H3) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing unprotected sexual behavior over time. Additionally HLM will be used to determine whether (H1a) the effect of Familias Unidas on illicit drug use will be partially mediated by family functioning; (H2a) the effect of Familias Unidas on cigarette use will be partially mediated by family functioning and (H3a) the effect of Familias Unidas on unprotected sexual behavior will be partially mediated by family functioning.

"Drug Abuse and Crime Across the Life Course in an African American Population    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans are disproportionately represented in national crime statistics for arrests and incarceration as well as victimization, particularly for drug-related and violent offenses. Their involvement in crime often represents only one component of a well-recognized cluster of negative experiences and circumstances including drug use problems, socioeconomic disadvantage and poor physical and mental health, sometimes evident in childhood. The cost to individuals, families, and society is enormous, yet we know little about the development of these patterns across the life course. Despite these evident disparities, few studies have examined the development of drug use and criminal behaviors over time within African American community populations, especially into mid adulthood. We intend to study the timing and sources of risk over the life span to better understand the disparities in health and social consequences related to criminal justice issues among African Americans. To that end, we request support to analyze existing crime and drug data covering 35 years in the lives of a cohort of first grade, African American children from inner city Chicago. This prospective developmental study (the Woodlawn project) began in 1966-67, with the most recent follow up in 2002-3 at ages 42-43, and interim assessments in adolescence and early adulthood (age 32-33). The study population had high levels of drug use and criminal activity in adulthood. In the proposed project, we will focus on interrelationships of drug abuse and crime, examining predictors and consequences of drug abuse, criminal activity, and involvement with the criminal justice system. Using data from cohort members, mothers, interviewers, and official criminal records, we will identify 1) patterns of drug use and criminal behaviors over the life course; 2) individual and contextual predictors of later drug use, criminal activity/behaviors, and involvement with the criminal justice system; 3) social, economic, and health consequences of drug use, criminal behaviors, and involvement in the criminal justice system. Of particular interest is how drug use in adolescence and early adulthood relates to the risk of being arrested and incarcerated and, conversely, how early arrests and incarceration influence later drug use and criminal behaviors. This information will further our understanding of the etiology and consequences of crime and drug use into mid adulthood, and inform the design of interventions at various stages along the life course.             ",Drug Abuse and Crime Across the Life Course in an African American Population,7755368,R01DA022366,"['Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' criminal behavior ', ' Health ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Interviewer ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Individual ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Staging ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Life ', ' Victimization ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' Time Study ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' interest ', ' first grade ', ' inner city ', ' experience ', ' social integration ', ' cohort ', ' intervention program ', ' member ', ' Population Study ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Chicago ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Sampling ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' Social Functioning ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' ']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,475959,0.19747166288874865
"Community Vulnerability and Responses to Drug-User-Related HIV/AIDS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing continuation application for the Community Vulnerability and Responses to Drug-User- Related HIV/AIDS study of why large US metropolitan areas vary over time in their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS among drug users and in their responses-i.e., in policies and programs that may affect the epidemic. Drug use and HIV epidemics change over time. In the last funding period, we showed that HIV prevalence in the 96 largest US metropolitan areas declined among injection drug users (IDUs) from 1992 to 2002, and that the population prevalence of IDUs declined in these areas from 1992 to 2000, but then began to rise again. We also showed that metropolitan areas varied in these trajectories, and that a variety of social and policy forces shaped IDU prevalence, racial disparities in IDU prevalence, HIV prevalence among IDUs, racial disparities in AIDS prevalence among IDUs, drug abuse treatment coverage, and syringe exchange access and coverage. Ominously, our recent analyses indicate that the prevalence of IDUs among youth (aged 15 - 29) has begun to rise. Further, as others have shown, HIV has spread widely among NIDUs (non-injecting users of heroin, cocaine, crack, amphetamines or methamphetamine) in some metropolitan areas. These changes are occurring against the backdrop of an economy that has recently shifted from slow to rapid decline, a shift that will lead to great difficulty in maintaining, let alone expanding, services for drug users. Therefore, the Specific Aims of this proposed continuation are: 1. To describe trends, in the 96 largest US metropolitan areas from 1992 - 2012, in (a) critical epidemiologic outcomes (population prevalence of IDUs and NIDUs, and particularly their prevalence among youth; and, among IDUs, HIV prevalence, late-diagnosis HIV cases, and AIDS incidence and mortality) as well as in (b) the implementation of evidence-based drug- related interventions (drug abuse treatment, syringe exchange, HIV counseling and testing) and (c) non- evidence-based drug-related interventions (incarceration and arrests of drug users). 2. To understand how macro-social contexts (e.g., economic changes, social integration, racial residential segregation) and epidemiologic need affect interventions; how interventions and macro-social contexts together affect epidemiologic contexts; how some interventions (e.g., arrests, incarceration) affect others (e.g., syringe exchange coverage); and how some epidemiologic outcomes (e.g., prevalence of young IDUs) affect others (e.g., HIV prevalence). 3. To develop an integrated theory, using agent based modeling, of how these processes interact and thus what the impacts of various intervention mixes are likely to be in given social contexts. 4. To disseminate estimates, results and theoretical understandings to public health agencies and continue to advise them on how they might respond.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will estimate changes in injection and non-injection drug use, in HIV, AIDS and AIDS mortality rates among injection drug users, and in drug- and HIV-related interventions among drug users, in 96 large metropolitan areas over a 21-year period (1992 - 2012). We will investigate how these epidemics and interventions affect one another, and how macro-contextual factors like economic and social conditions shape them both. We will identify metropolitan areas in which serious drug use, HIV or AIDS epidemics are emerging, and offer state and local health departments and drug agencies the best information available on policies and programs that might reduce these epidemics. Our findings will also help national public health agencies, including the CDC and SAMHSA, and other researchers, plan a mixture of evidence-based programs and policies to reduce the forces that lead to high-risk drug use and the associated HIV and AIDS epidemics.           Public Health Relevance Statement This project will estimate changes in injection and non-injection drug use, in HIV, AIDS and AIDS mortality rates among injection drug users, and in drug- and HIV-related interventions among drug users, in 96 large metropolitan areas over a 21-year period (1992 - 2012).

"Stress and Drug Use Vulnerability in Rural African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The impact that drug addictions have on health disparities impacting at-risk African Americans who reside in the rural South are grossly understudied. While there is strong evidence linking drug use and abuse to violent behaviors, injuries, mental health, and physical health problems, it is unclear how African Americans are disproportionately at risk given their relatively low incidence rates of drug use and abuse. There is a growing body of literature linking stress and the subsequent activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to addictions. Given the considerable heterogeneity within drug-related phenotypes and limited evidence of large-magnitude single gene influences, stress dysregulation will be investigated as an endophenotype for clarifying the more subtle relationship between specific genes and drug use vulnerability. This study will pursue two specific aims using innovative experimental methodologies from drug abuse, molecular genetics, endocrinology, social psychology, and cross-cultural research: (1) Investigate whether genotype interacts with environmental variables (GxE) to affect physiological responses to acute stress; and (2) Investigate whether stress dysregulation predicts drug related attitudes, craving, and history of drug use. Acute stress will be elicited via the Trier Social Stress Test. Subjects (N = 100) will be randomly assigned into one of two speech tasks: (a) shoplifting or (b) experience of discrimination. Measured variables will include genotype (CRH and CRHR1), hormones (cortisol and DHEA), autonomic measures (galvanic skin conductance and heart rate variability), chronic environmental stressors, implicit drug-related cognitions, drug craving, and drug use history. It is envisioned that this proposed study can initiate a multidisciplinary program of research aimed at investigating gene by environment (GxE) influences on drug use vulnerability. Empirical research in this area is needed in order to gain insight into the biopsychosocial risk factors that have the capacity to inform theory, research, prevention, and treatment in the area of drug addictions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American drug use and abuse behaviors are often characterized by oversimplified models that are rooted in research studies that rarely include them. This proposal seeks to take a multidimensional approach (e.g., genetics, endocrinology, psychology, culture, social environment) towards investigating mechanisms that may increase drug use vulnerability in at-risk African American adults who reside in the rural South. Such research is needed in order to inform theory, research, prevention, and intervention efforts aimed at elimination health disparities that disproportionately impact this community.           PROJECT NARRATIVE African American drug use and abuse behaviors are often characterized by oversimplified models that are rooted in research studies that rarely include them.

"Text Messaging Adherence Assessment & Intervention Tool for Rural HIV+ Drug Users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a new application under PAS-10-098, Technology-based Adherence Interventions for Substance Abusing Populations with HIV (R34). New methods to promote HIV treatment adherence are needed for drug users, ethnic minorities, and women, who reside outside major metropolitan areas who have worse health outcomes. Familiar technological devices such as mobile phones could overcome some of the health disparities seen among rural HIV+ patients. In this project, investigators will develop and test the feasibility and promise of a text messaging system that uses Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) methods to detect nonadherence and drug use episodes, then immediately intervenes to improve HIV treatment adherence (both medication adherence and treatment engagement) in drug users living with HIV/AIDS. Using formative research with the targeted patients and partnership with a technology developer, we will develop the application and administrative system, Treatment Extension by Text (Text). Text will assess routine adherence, allow users to report critical events, and respond to randomly timed queries about adherence, drug use, and drug craving. When the Text EMA application detects threats to adherence, it will deliver a personalized, tailored intervention text message chosen by the participant. These customized messages will remind the user to take medications on time and reduce drug use. Investigators will pilot test the new adherence tool against treatment as usual over a three month period in a small pilot randomized trial to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and promise of Text. This R34 is a Stage 1b/2a project in the Stage Model of Behavioral Therapy Development in that it will develop novel interventions and methods, and generate preliminary estimates of effect sizes that will determine whether a larger, more expensive clinical trial with a longer follow-up period and evaluation of cost-effectiveness is warranted. By using technology to assess and detect episodes of nonadherence, drug use, and drug craving in real time, the project will deliver an intervention ""on the fly"" in time to help the person resume medication adherence before health damages occur. If successful, Text has the possibility of rapid scale-up for further trials across the rural U.S. to follow.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and pilot test a text messaging system for mobile phones to assess HIV treatment adherence, quickly detect problems as they occur, and send personalized intervention messages to help rural and non-urban drug using patients achieve HIV medication adherence and interrupt drug use. This intervention could be scaled up quickly as a novel, sustainable approach to maintaining treatment adherence.

"PS07-003, Minority HIV/AIDS Research Initiative (MARI)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The proposed study's overarching goal is to reduce the ethnic disparities in HIV infection between Hispanic and non-Hispanic youth living in Miami-Dade County, an HIV epicenter. This goal will be accomplished by two aims: AIM 1 is to develop and manualize a one-and-a-half- month streamlined version of an efficacious HIV preventive intervention entitled Familias Unidas; and AIM II is to evaluate the efficacy of the streamlined version of Familias Unidas plus an HIV Prevention School CurriculumTreatment as Usual, relative to the HIV Prevention School Curriculum Treatment as Usual only, in preventing drug use and unprotected sexual behavior, two risk factors for HIV infection. Familias Unidas aims to prevent drug use and unprotected sexual behavior by (a) increasing family functioning, (b) increasing parental monitoring of peer activities, and (c) influencing adolescent social cognitive mechanisms regarding drug use and unsafe sexual behavior. A sample of 240 Hispanic 9th grade adolescents and their primary caregivers will be randomized to one of two conditions: Familias Unidas plus the HIV School Curriculum Treatment as Usual (hereafter refererred to as Familias Unidas) or the HIV Prevention School Curriculum Treatment as Usual only. Two studies have demonstrated the efficacy of an intensive, 9 to 12 month version of Familias Unidas. In the first study, Familias Unidas was shown to be efficacious relative to a no- intervention control condition in increasing family functioning. In the second study, Familias Unidas was found to be efficacious in preventing drug use and unsafe sexual behavior relative to two attention control conditions. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) will be used to test: (H1) Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than the HIV Prevention School Curriculum Treatment as Usual in preventing adolescent drug use over time and (H2) Familias Unidas will be more efficacious than the HIV Prevention School Curriculum Treatment as Usual in preventing adolescent unprotected sexual behavior over time. Additionally HLM will be used to determine whether (H1a) the effect of Familias Unidas on drug use will be partially mediated by (1) family functioning; (2) parental monitoring of peers; and (3) social cognitive mechanisms regarding drug use; and (H2a) the effect of Familias Unidas on unprotected sexual behavior will be partially mediated by (1) family functioning; (2) parental monitoring of peers; (3) social cognitive mechanisms regarding unprotected sex; and (4) drug use. The objective of the proposed study is to reduce HIV contraction health disparities in Hispanic populations. The knowledge expected to be gained from this study will aid in the development of interventions to reduce drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and HIV in Hispanic adolescents.

"Developmental Pathways to Substance Use Across European & Asian American Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As one of the fastest growing ethnic minority groups in the United States, alcohol and drug use in American Americans has increasingly been recognized as a public health problem. Emerging research has documented biological, psychosocial, and cultural factors that are associated with alcohol use in Asian American youth adults (Hendershot et al., 2005). However, existing studies have neither adopted a developmental perspective to study the emergence of alcohol use and problems in Asian American during late adolescence, nor have they tested whether prior findings can be generalized to predict drug use and problems. Concurrently, evidence from a separate line of research has suggested that effects of parenting are often different across Asian and European American youth. Numerous studies, for example, have suggested that authoritarian parenting style has beneficial effects in Asian American youth, but detrimental effects in European American youth on outcomes such as academic performance and socio-emotional competence. Subsequent research has indicated that parental constructs such as emotional support and psychological control may also have differential effects across Asian and European American youth (e.g., Chao & Tseng, 2002). Despite these findings, no published study has documented differential effects of parenting on alcohol and drug use across Asian and European American youth. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to examine moderation effects by ethnicity on the association between parenting and alcohol and drug use outcomes in a longitudinal sample of Asian and European American youth. Specifically, the proposed study will test whether parental emotional support, psychological control and monitoring have differential effects on alcohol and drug use outcomes across Asian and European American youth. Data will be drawn from 97 Asian American and 255 European American youth who participated in the Developmental Pathway Project. Structural equation modeling and factor analysis techniques will be used to test (1) whether parental emotional support, psychological control, and monitoring in 7th grade will differentially predict alcohol and drug use outcomes in 9th and 12th grade across Asian and European American youth; (2) whether developmental pathways from parenting to alcohol and drug use outcomes (via school achievement and peer substance use in 8th grade) are different across Asian and European American youth; and (3) whether the hypothesized moderation effects by ethnicity can be attributed to different interpretation of parenting, as suggested by prior research (e.g., Chao & Aque, 2009). Results from the proposed study can be used to guide the development of culturally sensitive prevention and intervention programs for alcohol and drug use in Asian American youth.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project addresses a strategic goal of the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) on the prevention of alcohol and drug use through understanding risk and protective factors in adolescence, a developmental stage during which substance use increases over time. This project also addresses NIDA's cross-cutting priorities of decreasing health disparity related to drug addiction and training new investigators from a diverse (including minority) background. The ultimate goal of this project is to limit substance use initiation and problematic use through the development of culturally sensitive prevention and intervention programs for Asian American youth.                The proposed project addresses a strategic goal of the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) on the prevention of alcohol and drug use through understanding risk and protective factors in adolescence, a developmental stage during which substance use increases over time.

"Clinical and Social Implications of Cost Sharing for Cancer Drugs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Yu-Ning Wong, a Medical Oncologist at Fox Chase Cancer Center is dedicated to a career in cancer health services research. Her goal is to develop a multidisciplinary research program to understand the impact of insurance design on cancer drug utilization and clinical outcomes. This Career Development Award will provide the means to take two important steps towards accomplishing this goal. First, it will allow for additional intensive mentored education and training in public policy research, health economics, and advanced statistical methods that will augment the candidate's previous rigorous training in epidemiology, biostatistics, and clinical medicine. Second, it will support the development of an original clinical research program using rigorous epidemiologic, econometric and survey methods to examine the impact of prescription drug insurance coverage on cancer outcomes. As new costly cancer drugs are introduced, patients with both public and private insurance are facing higher out- of-pocket costs. Cost sharing between insurers and patients (though co-payments and deductibles) has been traditionally used to control costs based on an expectation that unnecessary health care utilization will be reduced. However this expectation may result in worse socioeconomic disparities in care since some patients may be unable to afford highly effective cancer treatments. The candidate proposes three complementary studies to address the important, unanswered questions about the impact of cost sharing on cancer outcomes. Project A is a conjoint analysis-based survey to measure how patients make decisions among treatments of varying efficacy, toxicity and cost. Project B uses the results from Project A in a decision analysis model to measure the sensitivity of clinical outcomes to price and patient preferences. This will also allow us to determine if is possible to improve clinical outcomes by using low cost sharing to increase adherence to high value treatments. Project C is a natural experiment using insurance claims to measure the effect of insurance design and sociodemographic factors on the receipt of a new, expensive anti-nausea medication and subsequent outcomes. This research program will triangulate on the nexus of issues central to the understanding of cost sharing on cancer drug utilization and clinical outcomes and form the foundation for the candidate's transition to an independent investigator in cancer health services research. This project will have broad implications for the financing of high cost medical interventions because it will help policy makers, insurers and physicians understand how current models of cost sharing may contribute to socioeconomic disparities in cancer care. Our results may suggest consideration of a novel benefit design that encourages patients to make decisions based on relative value, rather than cost alone.           ",Clinical and Social Implications of Cost Sharing for Cancer Drugs,8145573,K07CA136995,"['payment ', ' health economics ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Public Policy ', ' cancer care ', ' Treatment Cost ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' chemotherapy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' anticancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Adoption ', ' Probability ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Decision Making ', ' career ', ' Observational Study ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Insurance ', ' Drug Utilization ', ' Nausea ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Antiemetics ', ' Antiemetic Drugs ', ' Antiemetic Agents ', ' Anti-emetics ', ' Policy Research ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Diffusion ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Training and Education ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Chronically Ill ', ' Research ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Patients ', ' United States ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Medical ', ' novel ', ' Individual ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Affect ', ' expectation ', ' Clinical ', ' programs ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' Measures ', ' Mentors ', ' Goals ', ' Methods ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Modeling ', ' Characteristics ', ' Data ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Outcome ', ' Address ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Physicians ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Foundations ', ' Risk ', ' cost ', ' improved ', ' Caring ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Clinical Medicine ', ' Clinical Medical Sciences ', ' Training ', ' Fox Chase Cancer Center ', ' Cost Control ', ' Cost Containment ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' aprepitant ', ' social implication ', ' Natural experiment ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Insurers ', ' Deductibles ', ' Drug Insurance ', ' Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' total medical expenditure ', ' medical expenses not covered by insurance ', ' Uninsured Medical Fees (not covered) ', ' Uncovered Uninsured Medical Expense ', ' Uncovered Medical Expenses ', ' Out-of-Pocket Expense ', ' Decision Analysis ', ' Decision Analyses ', ' Underinsured ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Medical Oncologist ', ' ']",NCI,FOX CHASE CANCER CENTER,K07,2011,144018,0.027485458307407232
"Community Vulnerability and Responses to Drug-User-Related HIV/AIDS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing continuation application for the Community Vulnerability and Responses to Drug-User- Related HIV/AIDS study of why large US metropolitan areas vary over time in their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS among drug users and in their responses-i.e., in policies and programs that may affect the epidemic. Drug use and HIV epidemics change over time. In the last funding period, we showed that HIV prevalence in the 96 largest US metropolitan areas declined among injection drug users (IDUs) from 1992 to 2002, and that the population prevalence of IDUs declined in these areas from 1992 to 2000, but then began to rise again. We also showed that metropolitan areas varied in these trajectories, and that a variety of social and policy forces shaped IDU prevalence, racial disparities in IDU prevalence, HIV prevalence among IDUs, racial disparities in AIDS prevalence among IDUs, drug abuse treatment coverage, and syringe exchange access and coverage. Ominously, our recent analyses indicate that the prevalence of IDUs among youth (aged 15 - 29) has begun to rise. Further, as others have shown, HIV has spread widely among NIDUs (non-injecting users of heroin, cocaine, crack, amphetamines or methamphetamine) in some metropolitan areas. These changes are occurring against the backdrop of an economy that has recently shifted from slow to rapid decline, a shift that will lead to great difficulty in maintaining, let alone expanding, services for drug users. Therefore, the Specific Aims of this proposed continuation are: 1. To describe trends, in the 96 largest US metropolitan areas from 1992 - 2012, in (a) critical epidemiologic outcomes (population prevalence of IDUs and NIDUs, and particularly their prevalence among youth; and, among IDUs, HIV prevalence, late-diagnosis HIV cases, and AIDS incidence and mortality) as well as in (b) the implementation of evidence-based drug- related interventions (drug abuse treatment, syringe exchange, HIV counseling and testing) and (c) non- evidence-based drug-related interventions (incarceration and arrests of drug users). 2. To understand how macro-social contexts (e.g., economic changes, social integration, racial residential segregation) and epidemiologic need affect interventions; how interventions and macro-social contexts together affect epidemiologic contexts; how some interventions (e.g., arrests, incarceration) affect others (e.g., syringe exchange coverage); and how some epidemiologic outcomes (e.g., prevalence of young IDUs) affect others (e.g., HIV prevalence). 3. To develop an integrated theory, using agent based modeling, of how these processes interact and thus what the impacts of various intervention mixes are likely to be in given social contexts. 4. To disseminate estimates, results and theoretical understandings to public health agencies and continue to advise them on how they might respond.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will estimate changes in injection and non-injection drug use, in HIV, AIDS and AIDS mortality rates among injection drug users, and in drug- and HIV-related interventions among drug users, in 96 large metropolitan areas over a 21-year period (1992 - 2012). We will investigate how these epidemics and interventions affect one another, and how macro-contextual factors like economic and social conditions shape them both. We will identify metropolitan areas in which serious drug use, HIV or AIDS epidemics are emerging, and offer state and local health departments and drug agencies the best information available on policies and programs that might reduce these epidemics. Our findings will also help national public health agencies, including the CDC and SAMHSA, and other researchers, plan a mixture of evidence-based programs and policies to reduce the forces that lead to high-risk drug use and the associated HIV and AIDS epidemics.          Public Health Relevance Statement  This project will estimate changes in injection and non-injection drug use, in HIV, AIDS and AIDS mortality  rates among injection drug users, and in drug- and HIV-related interventions among drug users, in 96 large  metropolitan areas over a 21-year period (1992 - 2012).

"The Logics for HIV Risk among Street-Based Heroin Injectors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a theoretically and ethnographically informed model of ""HIV risk environment"" for public health intervention by identifying the key structural forces, institutional processes, and socio-cultural constraints that shape HIV behaviors among inner-city street-based drug users. We will examine the social processes that drive the logics for HIV transmission behaviors among street-based injection drug users (IDUs) in two cities, Philadelphia and San Francisco, that span a strategic range of the demographic, economic, political, and cultural factors affecting inner-city poverty in the United States. Building on long-term, continuous participant-observation ethnographic fieldwork in the shooting encampments of ethnically and generationally bounded social networks of heroin injectors and crack smokers in San Francisco as well as pilot research in Philadelphia at open-air drug markets and shooting galleries, we will document patterns of: 1) law enforcement and criminal justice; 2) poverty and income generating opportunities (including legal and illegal labor markets and public subsidies); 3) illegal drug markets and polydrug availability; 4) racialized ethnic boundaries and conflicts; 5) gender/sexuality boundaries that delimit social networks; 6) oppositional sub-cultural identities that trap IDUs into counterproductive relationships with the services that are meant to help or contain them; 7) violence and insecurity; 8) access to clinical care, public health prevention messages, and social services; 9) access to ecological and basic survival needs infrastructures including transportation systems, food, and shelter from inclement weather. An experienced ethnographic team in both cities will collect data on individual-level HIV risk behaviors at fieldsites that we have successfully maintained on the parent grant for more than 12 years in San Francisco and recently established in Philadelphia (core N of each network=15-20 at any given time, peripheral N=10-15 in each fieldsite; 2 sites in Philadephia and 2 in San Francisco). The project will administer a set of procedures for cross-methodological collaboration with epidemiologists who are the Principal Investigators on long-term, large quantitative data sets documenting street-based drug users in both cities. This will enable us to examine the representativity of our ethnographic data on individual street-based drug users and to explore the generalizability of our analysis of the larger social structural processes that promote or constrain risky injection and sexual practices. It will also bring one of the largest and oldest NIDA-funded data sets on IDUs in San Francisco, an exceptionally high-tech, wealthy, culturally diverse, and liberal city into an illustrative contrast and dialogue with another large NIDA-supported quantitative data set of street-based drug users in the city of Philadelphia, one of the nation's poorest deindustrialized metropolises, with a declining population of largely native-born white, Latino (primarily Puerto Rican) and African American ethnic groups.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Untangling the complex web of factors that render inner city poverty environments exceptionally risky for HIV infection and addiction will help public health outreach workers and clinicians develop more innovative structural and targeted interventions to reach larger numbers of low income high-risk populations with more effective and convincing messages. Upstream interventions that alter neighborhood-level risk environments can cost-effectively encourage drug users to change their behaviors for pragmatic reasons without necessarily requiring a conscious or willful choice. Our findings will also identify strategic institutions and programs that often operate at cross purposes or fail to coordinate with public health HIV risk reduction priorities (including law enforcement, criminal justice, employment training, public housing, food kitchens, shelters, schools, and churches) but which represent productive sites for multi-service HIV prevention interventions.           Relevance: Untangling the complex web of factors that render inner city poverty environments exceptionally risky for HIV infection and addiction will help public health outreach workers and clinicians develop more innovative structural and targeted interventions to reach larger numbers of low income high-risk populations with more effective and convincing messages.

"Factors for enhanced neurotoxicity in methamphetamine abuse in HIV infection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted in response to PAR-09-011 Diversity-promoting Institutions Drug Abuse Research Program (DIDARP) requested by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). This proposed research program is timely since it focuses on two ofthe major health disparity issues in Hawaii, namely, methamphetamine abuse and HIV infection. Recent surveys indicate that Native Hawaiians or other Pacific islanders have the highest rate of methamphetamine use among persons aged 12 or older in the United States. Although HIV/AIDS infection rate is relatively low in Hawaii compared to other major metropolis, the rates are increasing among Hawaiians. This DIDARP will include two primary and one pilot research projects that will focus on mechanisms and factors that might enhance neurotoxicity associated with methamphetamine of HIV. We aim to enhance the capacity for drug abuse research at UH by creating this small translational research team. This group will take advantage and build on the expertise of the few but outstanding existing clinical drug abuse and HIV researchers and basic scientists. We aim to enable UH to develop a strong clinical and translational drug abuse research program. To complement these projects, we additionally propose training and career development activities that wil offer exciting opportunities for DIDARP investigators and others at UH through the Administrative and Training Core. The Faculty in the Core will provide guidance and mentorship for these junior faculty and graduate students, through infrastructure support, educational courses, seminars, and a dedicated DIDARP website, We have obtained institutional support for two additional graduate students for the program. We also have recruited 4 distinguished External Advisory Committee members with expertise related to the proposed research; each has enthusiastically agreed to provide their advice and letter of support for the development of this DIDARP at UH.

"Drug Policy, Incarceration, Community Re-entry, and Race Disparities in HIV/AIDS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a revision of an application submitted last year in response to PAR-07-379, ""Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Disparities."" We will analyze the interconnections between coercive mobility (the massive migration between the criminal justice [CJ] system and the community) produced by US drug policies and race disparities in HIV-related sexual risk among a sample of drug offenders in Connecticut (CT). Further, we will examine whether the association between coercive mobility (CM) and HIV-related sexual risk is affected by the degree of social disorganization in the communities in which these offenders reside. We also will study the feasibility of recruiting and following sexual partners of these individuals to better understand the impacts of CM on partners' HIV-related risk. We hypothesize that CM produces race disparities in HIV risk in a number of distinct ways: 1) Blacks are more likely than Whites to be incarcerated, so HIV-related sexual risk associated with CM can produce race disparities in HIV risk even if the effects of CM are the same for both Blacks and Whites; 2) Blacks are more likely than Whites to reside in communities experiencing the disorganizing impacts of CM, so to the extent that social disorganization exacerbates the effects of CM, it will affect the HIV risks of Blacks to a greater degree than Whites; 3) The sexual partners of Blacks are more likely to come from these same socially disorganized communities, furthering the negative impacts of CM for both returning inmates and their partners, and contributing to race disparities in HIV risk among women; and 4) Blacks are more likely to be penalized by drug policies in ways that increase their movement between prison/jail and the community and their vulnerability to its associated harms. We also hypothesize that we will be able to recruit and retain the sexual partners of study participants and conduct exploratory analyses of the impact of CM on their HIV-related sexual risk. An active Community Advisory Board including policymakers and program administrators will assist us in identifying structural interventions to reduce race disparities in HIV based on study findings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will examine the interconnections among drug policies in the US, coercive mobility (massive migration in and out of the criminal justice system), and race disparities in HIV-related sexual risk. It will suggest potential structural interventions for addressing the movement between prison/jail and the community, including drug policy reforms, with the potential to reduce race disparities in HIV/AIDS.           Narrative This research will examine the interconnections among drug policies in the US, coercive mobility (massive migration in and out of the criminal justice system), and race disparities in HIV-related sexual risk.

"Familias Unidas Stage III Study: Preventing Substance Abuse in Hispanic Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study's overarching goal is to reduce the ethnic disparities in illicit drug use, cigarette use, and HIV between Hispanic and non-Hispanic youth. This goal will be accomplished by four aims: AIM 1 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Practice (i.e., standard prevention services), in preventing illicit drug use; AIM 2 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Control, in preventing cigarette use; AIM 3 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Control, in preventing unprotected sexual behavior; and AIM 4 is to assess the extent to which family functioning mediates the effects of the intervention on illicit drug use, cigarette use, and unprotected sexual behavior. Twenty four middle schools with a total sample of 744 Hispanic adolescents from a wide geographic area of Miami-Dade County will be randomized using a block design to one of two conditions: Familias Unidas or Community Practice. The Familias Unidas intervention has been evaluated and found to be efficacious in two separate randomized controlled trials. In the first study (Pantin et al., 2003), Familias Unidas was shown to be efficacious relative to a no intervention control condition in increasing family functioning and reducing behavior problems (Prado et al., 2006), risk factors for youth illicit drug use and unprotected sex. In the second randomized controlled trial (Prado et al., in press), Familias Unidas was found to be efficacious, relative to two attention control conditions, in preventing cigarette use and illicit drug use. Familias Unidas was also found to be efficacious relative to both of the control conditions in preventing/reducing unprotected sexual behavior at last sexual intercourse. Finally, family functioning was found to mediate the effects of intervention condition on the outcomes. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) will be used to test: (H1) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing illicit drug use over time; (H2) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing cigarette use over time; and (H3) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing unprotected sexual behavior over time. Additionally HLM will be used to determine whether (H1a) the effect of Familias Unidas on illicit drug use will be partially mediated by family functioning; (H2a) the effect of Familias Unidas on cigarette use will be partially mediated by family functioning and (H3a) the effect of Familias Unidas on unprotected sexual behavior will be partially mediated by family functioning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of the proposed study is to reduce illicit drug use, cigarette use, and unsafe sexual behavior health disparities in Hispanic populations.

"Navigator Enhanced Case Management for Jail Inmates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year, there are over 600 unduplicated HIV-infected persons incarcerated in the San Francisco jail and almost two-thirds released with HIV-focused discharge planning were reincarcerated within 1 year. More than half of HIV-infected jail inmates are diagnosed with mental health conditions severe enough to require medication and a similar proportion report substance abuse disorders at the time of detention. While some community-based services exist, there remains a critical need exists to improve linkages to care and adherence to care plans for HIV-infected adults as they move between community and jai. An effective service delivery model used in similar high-needs populations exists, but has not been tested with HIV-infected drug users leaving jails - Navigator case management. Base on harm reduction, motivational interviewing and general social work principles, this model uses assertive community treatment and a highly proactive approach to facilitate adherence to a comprehensive care plan designed to address a client's multiple needs. Case managers work with paraprofessional peer navigators to help clients make better use of available resources, more effectively communicate with providers, sustain care over time and successfully connect with multiple service provider sectors. In this study, we propose to tailor this approach to meet the needs of HIV-infected individuals with substance abuse and mental health issues, pilot test the intervention and assessment procedures and then conduct a randomized study in which 360 HIV-infected men and women leaving jail. Specifically, participants will receive either Navigator case management delivered by the non-profit San Francisco Pre-Trial Diversion project or the standard of care currently provided to transitioning inmates, 90- days of as-needed case management provided by the San Francisco Department of Public Health's Forensic AIDS Project. We will test the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing sexual and drug-related HIV transmission risk, increasing HIV medication adherence, reducing drug dependence and reducing reincarceration. Finally, we will characterize both the Navigator and Forensic AIDS Project intervention processes and conduct exploratory analyses of the mediators of HIV transmission risk and risk reduction and HIV-related adherence among HIV+ individuals leaving jail. Our study is highly innovative because no interventions exist that are proven effective with this population - HIV-infected individuals with drug use and mental health issues. This study will also contribute to the field of HIV prevention by incorporating risk reduction counseling alongside more traditional case management support services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-infected adults incarcerated in the United States criminal justice system are predominantly active drug users and disproportionately people of color. The complex interplay of poverty, race, lack of education and sanctions--rather than treatment--for addictions reinforces returns to the criminal justice system and pervasive health disparities for HIV-infected individuals. Underlying behaviors that lead to repeated incarceration closely correlate with behaviors that are associated with HIV transmission and increased morbidity and mortality from HIV. In drug addicted adults, recidivism is driven by drug relapse and illegal activities associated with drug use, failure to engage and remain in mental health treatment or failure to break free from social instability in the form of homelessness and joblessness. This study proposes to assess whether a method of case management proven effective for similar populations can ensuring services to successfully and permanently break the cycle of incarceration, drug abuse and HIV transmission risk behavior among HIV-infected individuals leaving jail.              NARRATIVE HIV-infected adults incarcerated in the United States criminal justice system are predominantly active drug users and disproportionately people of color.

"Research Training in the Prevention of Drug Abuse & AIDS in Communities of Color    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised application for a MIDARP program at Howard University describes a mentoring program in drug abuse research and AIDS prevention in communities of color, which is designed to increase the capacity of faculty and students at Howard to conduct rigorous and competitive research in the prevention of drug abuse and HIV/AIDS in communities of color. The program will emphasize training in transdisciplinary research on relationships between environmental stress, biological responses, risk behaviors and health outcomes and will utilize collaborations with senior investigators in research intensive universities to mentor Howard faculty investigators. The MIDARP will also work closely with existing programs that link Howard faculty and students to research training opportunities to (1) increase knowledge and interest in drug abuse and AIDS prevention research among faculty and students in these programs and (2) utilize the resources of these programs to expand the range of training opportunities available to MIDARP investigators and students. Howard students will be introduced to drug abuse and AIDS prevention research and career development by augmenting existing drug abuse courses in the College of Arts and Sciences and the curriculum for medical, basic science, nursing, and pharmacy students to include information on drug abuse and AIDS prevention research. They will also fund a pre-doctoral dissertation stipend and recruit students to serve as research assistants in the MIDARP pilot studies. The unique strengths of the program include the opportunity to (1) integrate education regarding drug abuse and AIDS prevention research into existing research training programs for faculty and students;(2) train individuals in diverse disciplines such as the health professions and sciences (i.e., medicine, basic sciences, pharmacy, nursing) who are less likely to pursue research careers in drug abuse and AIDS prevention research; and (3) support transdisciplinary research in drug use and AIDS prevention based on strong existing university research programs in genetics, physiology, and psychobiology. A transdisciplinary approach will be reflected in the MIDARP leadership that includes a Director who is a behavioral scientist specializing in research on environmental stress, drug use, and AIDS risk

"Randomized Trial of IFCBT-HIVPI to Prevent HIV Among Non-Injection Drug Users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a second revision of a competitive renewal R01 proposal of the NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study in response to NIDA PAS-07-115 (Non-injection Dug Abuse and HIV/AIDS). The primary study aim is to evaluate the ability of Integrated Family and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy-HIV Prevention Intervention (IFCBT-HIVPI) to prevent HIV among adult non-injection and injection drug users. Over a 12 week intervention interval, the IFCBT-HIVPI model coordinates the delivery of cognitive- behavioral components during 12 group sessions with a couples and family systems component during 4 couples/family sessions to address HIV risk and protective factors across multiple ecological systems. IFCBT-HIVPI main effects on primary (HIV sexual risk behaviors and HIV drug taking risk behaviors) and secondary (HIV, Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis incidences and legal involvement, academic achievement, and employment) outcome domains will be evaluated. We also seek to elucidate the degree to which the development of attitudinal and behavior change skills targeted by IFCBT-HIVPI (e.g., rational beliefs, problem solving skill, adaptive couples' communication) result in post-intervention reductions of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and HIV risk behaviors. The possibility of effect-modification is also considered with a focus on route of drug administration status (i.e., non-injector/injector), neuropsychological (e.g., executive function), and demographic (i.e., African American/white) factors. The proposed study will randomly assign 360 HIV-negative non-injection and injection drug users recruited from the original NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study sample to experimental (IFCBT-HIVPI) and comparison (Brief Psychoeducation Curriculum on HIV Prevention; BPEC-HIV) conditions. The composition of the original NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study sample provides the basis to stratify the randomized trial sample across gender and two race/ethnicity (i.e., African American and white) groups by route of drug administration status. An assessment battery comprised of a standardized interview on HIV risk behavior, neuropsychological tests, tools to assess attitudes and behavior change skills targeted by IFCBT-HIVPI, drug and STI urine testing, and serologic tests of HIV will be administered before, during, and after the intervention interval across 18-month post-intervention follow-up. Additional preliminary analyses will be conducted on the randomized trial data to: (1) derive session-by-session measures on mechanisms of change targeted by IFCBT-HIVPI via videotape coding methods; (2) characterize mechanisms of change trajectories that may then be evaluated as plausible intervention moderators if present; and (3) estimate intervention cost-effectiveness. The lack of research on science-based prevention interventions for HIV continues to be a serious gap in the literature with recent HIV trends highlighting significant health disparities, particularly among African American non-injection drug users. If successful, the proposed project should help to identify specific attitudinal and behavior change skills targeted by cognitive- behavioral and couples/family systems interventions that foster subsequent reductions in HIV, STIs and HIV risk behaviors among adult drug users at heightened disease risk. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent estimates suggest that a majority of the 40,000 new cases of HIV reported annually in the US are attributable largely to sexual risk behavior associated with non-injection drug use. Additionally, African American drug users exhibit substantial HIV health disparities with African American females being 21 times more likely to contract HIV than white females. The proposed project is designed to address critical gaps in the HIV prevention science field by evaluating the ability of an intervention coordinating cognitive-behavioral and couples/family systems components to prevent HIV among adult drug users at heightened disease risk.

"Targeting HIV Risk Behaviors in Juvenile Drug Court-Involved Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overriding purpose of this study is to develop and test an intervention for reducing substance use and risky sexual behaviors among youth involved in juvenile drug court. Juvenile drug court provides an excellent setting in which to pursue the key study objectives by providing access to a well identified high risk population. Second, in addition to frequent judicial oversight, juvenile drug courts include several features that can enhance intervention effectiveness, sustainability, and potential for adoption. In addition, the fact that all juvenile drug courts have community-based treatment components and that such courts have been disseminated nationwide suggests the possibility of eventual widespread adoption if the proposed intervention is effective. The proposed intervention integrates evidence-based protocols for contingency management (CM) for substance abusing youth and family engagement strategies, with an evidence-informed family systems intervention for sexual risk originally developed to address substance use and sexual risk behaviors in HIV+ youth. These three interventions will be integrated into an efficient intervention that, if effective, can be amenable to adoption by juvenile drug courts. Following protocol development and beta testing, 160 drug court youth and their families will be randomized to the experimental intervention condition (HIV Risk Reduction or ""HRR"") versus Drug Court with Community Services (DC) conditions. Key outcomes will be assessed through 12-months post-baseline using a multi-method approach that will include assessment of substance use, risky sexual behaviors, criminal behavior, and participation in HIV counseling and testing services. Specific aims include: 1: Adapt existing intervention and training protocols into a single, efficient HRR intervention, beta test this HHR protocol with four youth in juvenile drug court and their families, and revise treatment and research protocols accordingly; 2: Conduct a randomized trial with 160 youth in juvenile drug court and their families to examine youth-level intervention effects (i.e., on substance use, sexual risk behavior, HIV counseling and testing, delinquent behavior) in comparison to DC through 12- months post referral and assess intervention fidelity. 3. If results suggest a positive HRR treatment effect, revise the intervention and training protocols in preparation for an effectiveness study and extended follow-up study. Importantly, the proposed study will (1) consider the multiple levels of influence on juvenile drug use, criminal justice involvement, and HIV risk behaviors, (2) integrate a drug abuse and HIV prevention intervention for youth in the criminal justice system with drug-related offenses, (3) address health disparities by targeting a primarily minority population of youth, and (4) increase referrals to HIV testing and counseling of drug court-involved youth. This study is designed to reduce HIV risk by addressing the potent interaction of drug use and risky sexual behaviors in drug court youth with evidence-based treatment components to maximize the likelihood of reversing these youths' adverse behavioral trajectories.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study is designed to gain knowledge about effective interventions for reducing HIV risk in a high risk population. Reducing HIV risk by effectively targeting substance use and risky sexual behaviors and by locating even a small number of HIV-positive youth could favorably impact society at multiple levels (individual, family, peer, community, fiscal).

"HIV - Emergence of Drug Resistance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is to renew a project focused on using mathematical models to understand and predict the emergence of drug resistance to antiretrovirals (ARVs) for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). As the usage rate of ARVs in resource-poor regions is increasing, high levels of drug resistance potentially could emerge and have a devastating impact on public health worldwide, derailing global plans to provide this treatment to many millions of HIV-infected individuals. Our proposed projects will extend the work of the current award, which showed the value of using mathematical models to understand the temporal dynamics of drug-resistant strains of HIV in the United States (US), and for predicting the magnitude of resistance in this setting. In the renewal our work will be extended by combining mathematical modeling with statistical analysis of datasets collected by collaborating groups in the US, Europe and Africa. We will have access to data on drug resistance and important related variables from large scale epidemiological and treatment studies conducted in these three continents. In resource-poor settings, such as Africa, drugs will be limited and thus demand will often greatly exceed supply. We will investigate the problems of allocating ARVs in Africa by using operation research (OR) techniques. We have three Specific Aims. Aim 1: to understand the emergence, explain the present, and predict the evolution of, complex epidemics of drug-resistant strains of HIV in the US and Europe. Aim 2: to predict the evolution of epidemics of drug-resistant strains, as a result of first- line regimens and prophylactic use of ARVs, in Africa. Aim 3: to evaluate the consequences of allocation of scarce HIV healthcare resources in Africa. To achieve this aim we will use models to evaluate the epidemiological and ethical consequences of gender-inequities in access to treatment, assess the epidemiological and ethical impact of treatment priority criteria, and determine healthcare resource allocation strategies that ensure sustainability. Our studies in the renewal will link transmission modeling, OR techniques and statistical analyses; our analyses will take advantage of the extraordinary data sets provided by our collaborators in the US, Europe and Africa.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The emergence and control of drug-resistant strains of HIV is now a global problem. The epidemiology of this problem is complex, and the future of the HIV epidemic is unknown. Our projects focus on using mathematical models to understand, explain, and predict, the evolution of complex epidemics composed of drug-resistant strains of HIV in the US, Europe and Africa. The rollout of antiretrovirals in Africa is just beginning; however demand for drugs greatly exceeds supply. We will, by using mathematical models, evaluate the epidemiological and ethical consequences of allocation of the scarce supply of antiretrovirals in Africa. Our studies are based upon both mathematical modeling and data analyses. Our analyses will take advantage of the extraordinary data sets provided by our collaborators in the US, Europe and Africa.

"Economic Evaluation of Drug Abuse Treatment and HIV Prevention Services for Pregn    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Economic evaluation of drug abuse treatment and HIV prevention services for pregnant women is critical to identify the most efficient and equitable use of scarce resources. Economic and policy research on the efficiency of drug abuse treatment and HIV prevention services among vulnerable populations such as women, adolescents and members of minority groups is necessary to improve drug abuse and HIV/AIDS services for these vulnerable and underserved populations. While work in this area continues to grow, there is still a dearth of rigorous economic evaluations of such programs, especially those that adhere to quality standards as recommended by the U.S. Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. The overall objective of this study is to conduct the first economic evaluation of an innovative behavioral approach integrating Motivational Enhancement Therapy with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET-CBT) as compared to standard Brief Advice (BA) within prenatal care to decrease use of a full range of substances (e.g., marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines, alcohol, nicotine), to reduce HIV risk behavior and to achieve better infant health outcomes (e.g. longer gestations, greater birth weight, reduced medical consequences such as admission and length of stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)). The specific aims of this study are: (1) to conduct cost analyses of the MET-CBT and BA intervention arms; (2) to conduct incremental cost-effectiveness analyses of the two interventions (MET-CBT and BA), vis-`-vis each other, in terms of substance use, infant health outcomes and HIV risk reduction; and (3) to conduct incremental cost-utility analyses determining the net cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) saved respectively by each intervention arm (MET-CBT and BA), vis-`-vis each other, in terms of substance use and HIV risk reduction. The proposed research is responsive to PA-07-122 in that it proposes to conduct research related to cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses, services costs, methodological research, and the cross-cutting themes of HIV/AIDS and health disparities. The proposed research is grounded in sound microeconomic principles and standardized techniques as reported in the U.S. Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine, and proposes rigorous conceptual and methodological research to improve the evidence base on the unit costs and cost-effectiveness of substance abuse treatment and HIV prevention services. It builds on a NIDA-funded randomized controlled trial (R01-DA019135) of an innovate behavioral approach, which offers a new paradigm of treatment services, integrating MET-CBT within prenatal care compared to standard BA, and offering promise to improve access to and strengthen substance use treatment and HIV prevention services targeted at drug using pregnant women who are highly susceptible to HIV/AIDS.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug abuse and high risk HIV behavior during pregnancy are major public health problems in the United States due to their impact on individual users, their offspring, and surrounding communities. Drug abuse and HIV prevention programs targeting pregnant women have the potential to be cost-effective due to the resultant fewer low-birth-weight babies and perinatal deaths, fewer physical, cognitive and behavioral problems during infancy and childhood, and the significant health benefits that can accrue to the mother. The overall objective of this study is to conduct the first economic evaluation of an innovative behavioral approach integrating Motivational Enhancement Therapy with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET-CBT) as compared to standard Brief Advice (BA) within prenatal care to decrease use of a full range of substances (e.g., marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines, alcohol, nicotine), to reduce HIV risk behavior and to achieve better infant health outcomes (e.g. longer gestations, greater birth weight, reduced medical consequences such as admission and length of stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)).           PROJECT NARRATIVE Drug abuse and high risk HIV behavior during pregnancy are major public health problems in the United States due to their impact on individual users, their offspring, and surrounding communities.

"Social networks and HIV risk among rural drug users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is in response to PA-06-478, ""Research on Rural Mental Health and Drug Abuse Disorders"". One of the research areas highlighted by this PA is the examination of rural HIV transmission using social network analysis. The overall goal of the study is to examine the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors for HIV and other blood borne infections (BBIs) such as hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) among rural Appalachian drug users using social network analysis and multilevel modeling. HIV continues to be a major public health problem in the United States, especially among drug users. However, little is known about HIV in rural areas in which there are marked health disparities. Therefore, given that studies among urban drug users have found that social network indicators are robust predictors of HIV risk, both social network and individual characteristics will be measured for their association with HIV risk among rural drug users. The specific aims are: 1) To determine the prevalence and incidence of HIV, HCV and HBV among rural injection and non- injection drug users; 2) To examine HIV and other BBI risk among rural injection and non-injection drug users; and 3) To examine longitudinal changes in rural HIV, HCV and HBV risk at 6-months, 12-months and 18- months post-baseline. To meet these aims, a sample 500 rural injection and non-injection drug users will be recruited using respondent driven sampling (RDS). In addition to biologic testing for HIV, HCV and HBV, rural participants will be given an interviewer-administered questionnaire pertaining to their social networks (drug, sexual and support networks), sociodemographics, drug use, HIV risk behaviors, psychiatric diagnoses, intravention and norms. Since individuals will be nested within networks, data will be analyzed using multilevel random effects regression that allows for the simultaneous examination of social network and individual-level risk. Consistent with the priorities of the NIDA AIDS Research Program, this proposal will explore the social network structure in a rural drug using population in order to better understand how network factors may affect HIV risk in rural areas using an innovative multilevel approach. Results from the proposed study will inform the design and implementation of HIV interventions in rural areas and help to determine the appropriate population for which to target such activities in order to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV and other BBIs.       Although HIV remains a significant public health problem in the United States, especially among drug users, little is known about HIV risk in rural areas such as Appalachia. It has been shown in urban populations that relationships among drug users, also known as social networks, are important predictors of HIV risk. Therefore, this study seeks to characterize rural HIV risk by measuring both social network and individual behaviors in order to inform prevention activities in health resource-deprived rural areas.          ",Social networks and HIV risk among rural drug users,8013901,R01DA024598,"['Questionnaires ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non-A non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non A non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis nonA nonB ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' PT-NANBH ', ' Non-B Hepatitis Parenterally-Transmitted Non-A ', ' NANBH ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Social Network ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Serologic tests ', ' serology ', ' Serological Tests ', ' Hepatitis B Virus ', ' Homologous Serum Hepatitis Virus ', ' HBV ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' urban area ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' Rural Population ', ' Hepatitis B ', ' serum hepatitis ', ' infection with hepatitis B virus ', ' infection with HBV ', ' Viral Hepatitis B ', ' Hepatitis B Infection ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Health Resources ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachia ', ' Urban Population ', ' Individual Adjustment ', ' Kentucky ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' HCV ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Respondent ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Incidence ', ' Research Priority ', ' Epidemic ', ' United States ', ' Psychiatric Diagnosis ', ' Goals ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' programs ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' meetings ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Behavior ', ' Population ', ' response ', ' Modeling ', ' Interviewer ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Area ', ' Individual ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Participant ', ' Time ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Prevention ', ' Affect ', ' Research ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' rural area ', ' Reporting ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Characteristics ', ' Interview ', ' Rural ', ' Risk ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Risk Factors ', ' high risk ', ' Communities ', ' Infection ', ' Sampling ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Data ', ' Structure ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Prevalence ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Seroprevalences ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Drug user ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2011,577058,0.12666251430322556
"African American Female Drug Users: HIV, Health Disparities, & Criminality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this study is to understand how drug use and criminality are related to health disparities, particularly HIV, and service utilization among African American drug using and non-drug using women across criminal justice status. While drug use is similar across racial groups in the US, African Americans are disproportionately more likely to experience severe health consequences and criminal involvement as a result of drug misuse. Adequate health care may not be received by African American female offenders because they experience the burden of their race, class, gender, and criminal offender status. There is limited scientific data to help understand the linkages between health disparities such as HIV, untreated drug abuse, barriers to service utilization, and status as a criminal offender among African American females. This study is significant because of its potential to identify differences in health disparities and service utilization among African American drug using and non-drug using women in selected levels of criminal justice status (intensive correctional supervision-prison (n=200), moderate correctional supervision-jail (n=200), community supervision-probation (n=200), and no criminal justice involvement (n=200)). All 800 African American females will be followed longitudinally for three 6-month intervals to examine health status and the use of health services across time. The specific aims are: (1) To describe the prevalence of health problems among African American women across criminal justice status and drug use status; (2) To determine the cultural, predisposing, historical health, and potential enabling factors that are predictors of health problems among African American drug using and non-drug using women across criminal justice status over 18 months; (3) To describe the prevalence of untreated health problems, the patterns of health services utilization, and the cultural barriers to service utilization among African American women across criminal justice status and drug use status; and (4) To examine the factors that predict the likelihood of using health services among African American drug using and non-drug using women across criminal justice status over 18 months. The significance of this study includes the potential to provide criminal justice systems-level data for health planning and health policy for prevention, intervention, and treatment of African American female drug users.       This study is significant to the public health field because of its potential to understand the severity of health disparities among African American women across criminal justice status and drug use status and to predict health status and the use of health services over time. This knowledge of African American females can be used as a foundation for future criminal justice systems-level interventions to increase the use of preventative health care and subsequently reduce the need for expensive medical services, as well as to decrease HIV risk behaviors including drug use, unprotected sex, and recidivism.          ","African American Female Drug Users: HIV, Health

"Targeting HIV Risk Behaviors in Juvenile Drug Court-Involved Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overriding purpose of this study is to develop and test an intervention for reducing substance use and risky sexual behaviors among youth involved in juvenile drug court. Juvenile drug court provides an excellent setting in which to pursue the key study objectives by providing access to a well identified high risk population. Second, in addition to frequent judicial oversight, juvenile drug courts include several features that can enhance intervention effectiveness, sustainability, and potential for adoption. In addition, the fact that all juvenile drug courts have community-based treatment components and that such courts have been disseminated nationwide suggests the possibility of eventual widespread adoption if the proposed intervention is effective. The proposed intervention integrates evidence-based protocols for contingency management (CM) for substance abusing youth and family engagement strategies, with an evidence-informed family systems intervention for sexual risk originally developed to address substance use and sexual risk behaviors in HIV+ youth. These three interventions will be integrated into an efficient intervention that, if effective, can be amenable to adoption by juvenile drug courts. Following protocol development and beta testing, 160 drug court youth and their families will be randomized to the experimental intervention condition (HIV Risk Reduction or ""HRR"") versus Drug Court with Community Services (DC) conditions. Key outcomes will be assessed through 12-months post-baseline using a multi-method approach that will include assessment of substance use, risky sexual behaviors, criminal behavior, and participation in HIV counseling and testing services. Specific aims include: 1: Adapt existing intervention and training protocols into a single, efficient HRR intervention, beta test this HHR protocol with four youth in juvenile drug court and their families, and revise treatment and research protocols accordingly; 2: Conduct a randomized trial with 160 youth in juvenile drug court and their families to examine youth-level intervention effects (i.e., on substance use, sexual risk behavior, HIV counseling and testing, delinquent behavior) in comparison to DC through 12- months post referral and assess intervention fidelity. 3. If results suggest a positive HRR treatment effect, revise the intervention and training protocols in preparation for an effectiveness study and extended follow-up study. Importantly, the proposed study will (1) consider the multiple levels of influence on juvenile drug use, criminal justice involvement, and HIV risk behaviors, (2) integrate a drug abuse and HIV prevention intervention for youth in the criminal justice system with drug-related offenses, (3) address health disparities by targeting a primarily minority population of youth, and (4) increase referrals to HIV testing and counseling of drug court-involved youth. This study is designed to reduce HIV risk by addressing the potent interaction of drug use and risky sexual behaviors in drug court youth with evidence-based treatment components to maximize the likelihood of reversing these youths' adverse behavioral trajectories.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study is designed to gain knowledge about effective interventions for reducing HIV risk in a high risk population. Reducing HIV risk by effectively targeting substance use and risky sexual behaviors and by locating even a small number of HIV-positive youth could favorably impact society at multiple levels (individual, family, peer, community, fiscal).           PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is designed to gain knowledge about effective interventions for reducing HIV risk in a high risk population.

"Rural and Urban African American Cocaine Users' Perceived Need for Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to study the factors associated with rural/urban differences in perceived need for both drug abuse treatment and HIV testing because these are complementary services which could be integrated within formal drug abuse treatment programs or other locations to better meet the needs of African American cocaine users. We focus on perceived need among African American cocaine users because of their low rates of drug abuse treatment and HIV testing nationally as well as their demonstrated low perceived need for drug abuse treatment, high rates of risky sexual behaviors, and aversion to seeking HIV testing at local health departments in our prior research. Given that our prior natural history research did not include any urban areas, we do not know whether the low rates of drug abuse treatment and HIV testing among rural Arkansans are specific to rural residents (e.g., whether there is a disparity in access for rural African Americans) or whether urban African American cocaine users differ in other critical factors. To address these issues, we plan to conduct a community-based mixed methods study of African American cocaine users residing in rural and urban areas of Arkansas. Specifically, we propose a sequential mixed-method design, with qualitative key informant interviews conducted first (30 rural, 30 urban), followed by larger-scale, structured interviews (200 rural, 200 urban) using standardized instruments, pertinent measures from our prior rural health services and HIV research, and newly developed questions based on our initial qualitative work. Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS), a variant of snowball sampling, will be used to identify and recruit participants. The primary aims of the study are: 1) Using qualitative methods, to describe rural/urban differences in pathways to drug use and drug use cultures, perceptions of access to drug abuse treatment and HIV testing, awareness and perceptions of what constitutes drug abuse treatment and HIV testing, and preferences for formal or informal drug abuse treatment and the site or location of HIV testing; 2) Using quantitative and qualitative methods, to compare and contrast rural and urban cocaine users' perceived need for drug abuse treatment and HIV testing and key predisposing, enabling, health, and other factors which could impede or facilitate perceived need; and 3) Using quantitative methods, to investigate whether rural/urban differences in perceived need for drug abuse treatment and HIV testing are mediated by key predisposing, enabling, and health factors as well as treatment and testing awareness and preferences. The knowledge gained from this project will enable health policy makers, treatment program managers, and providers to make more informed decisions about how to encourage and facilitate the utilization of drug abuse treatment and HIV testing among African American cocaine users in the Southern U.S., an underserved and high risk population.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Of public health concern are the low rates of drug abuse treatment and high rates of HIV among African American cocaine users, especially in the Southern U.S. The knowledge gained from the proposed research would enable managers of public and behavioral health systems to make more informed decisions about how to target and tailor culturally sensitive messages aimed at increasing awareness of the benefits of drug abuse treatment and HIV testing. The proposed research would also provide new insight into whether HIV testing should be integrated within drug abuse treatment facilities to better meet the needs of rural as well as urban African American cocaine users.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Of public health concern are the low rates of drug abuse treatment and high rates of HIV among African American cocaine users, especially in the Southern U.S. The knowledge gained from the proposed research would enable managers of public and behavioral health systems to make more informed decisions about how to target and tailor culturally sensitive messages aimed at increasing awareness of the benefits of drug abuse treatment and HIV testing.

"HIV Infection in Ethnic Minority IDUs: An International Systematic Review    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial/ethnic group disparities in HIV/AIDS are a critical public health issue in the US. These disparities are particularly dramatic with respect to injecting drug use. African-Americans constitute 13% of the US population and 52% of recent US injecting drug use AIDS cases; Hispanics constitute 14% of the US population and 24% of the injecting drug use AIDS cases. These disparities are not the result of more injecting drug users among African-Americans and Hispanics, but of higher rates of HIV infection among African- American and Hispanic IDUs in many areas of the country. Similar disparities-higher rates of HIV infection among ethnic minority IDUs-have also been observed in many foreign countries. Indeed the situation of ethnic minority IDUs in some developing countries can be considered a crisis, with extremely high incidence, prevalence and HIV-related mortality. Disparities have also been observed among non-injecting drug users, with ethnic minority group members having higher rates of HIV infection. The logical next step for addressing these disparities and this epidemiological conundrum is not another individual study, but a systematic review of the large number of relevant studies that have been conducted to date. Our proposed systematic review will use state-of-the-art methods and include the US and the international data on ethnic group differences in HIV infection among drug users. The specific aims include: Developing procedures for combining qualitative and quantitative data from multiple research studies of IDUs in a single geographic area into a ""history of the HIV epidemic among IDUs"" in that area. Determining the frequency of HIV epidemics in which substantial differences in HIV infection have and have not arisen in ethnic minority IDUs vs. ethnic majority IDUs in the US and internationally. Identifying potential causal factors that may generate substantial differences in HIV prevalence among racial/ethnic minority vs. ethnic majority IDUs. Identifying potential causal factors that may perpetuate or reduce differences in HIV infection among racial/ethnic differences over time. Identifying epidemiologic situations in which differences in HIV risk behaviors do or do not statistically ""explain"" differences in HIV infection among racial/ethnic groups of IDUs. The research will also create an extremely rich dataset on HIV infection among ethnic drug uses that will be made available for use by other researchers and HIV prevention service providers. The research addresses one of the most important aspects of HIV/AIDS-the frequent large disparities in HIV infection among ethnic groups in the US and in many other countries. The research will be an innovative application of state of the art methods for systematic review, including extensive searching for published and unpublished studies, quantitative coding of research reports, and applying meta-regression/hierarchical modeling to these problems.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Higher rates of HIV infection among African-American and Hispanic IDUs are a major health disparity in the US. African-Americans comprise 13% of the US population and 52% of injection drug use AIDS cases, Hispanics 14% of the populations and 24% of cases. Similar disparities, higher rates of HIV infection among ethnic minority IDUs, have also been observed in many foreign countries. An international systematic review and meta-analysis should greatly advance our understanding of these disparities and suggest how they might be ameliorated.          ",HIV Infection in Ethnic Minority IDUs: An International Systematic Review,8103176,R01DA024612,"['Hepatitis C ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non-A non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non A non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis nonA nonB ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' PT-NANBH ', ' Non-B Hepatitis Parenterally-Transmitted Non-A ', ' NANBH ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Asia ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' user-friendly ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Glare ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Health Services Needs ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' non-drug ', ' nondrug ', ' North America ', ' Ethnic group ', ' repository ', ' Europe ', ' Communities ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Provider ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Recommendation ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Accounting ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Learning ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Injections ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Procedures ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Epidemic ', ' International ', ' Categories ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Services ', ' Methods ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Individual ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Research ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Modeling ', ' Population ', ' Data ', ' Time ', ' public health relevance ', ' Country ', ' Area ', ' Prevalence ', ' member ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Reporting ', ' Pattern ', ' Address ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Publishing ', ' Risk ', ' Incidence ', ' Site ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' systematic review ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' sex partner ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Australia ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' prevention service ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Drug user ', ' ']",NIDA,BETH ISRAEL MEDICAL CTR (NEW YORK),R01,2011,381562,0.06950887935870406
"Substance Use and Risky Sex in Highly Vulnerable Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The proposed project will help me develop the skills and expertise necessary to establish an independent research career focused on the role of substance use in sexual risk-taking behavior and associated adverse reproductive outcomes, especially sexually transmitted infections (STIs). To achieve this goal, I will supplement my graduate training as a developmental psychologist and postdoctoral training in epidemiology with training in sexual risk behavior in vulnerable populations, health disparities associated with race, and career development in longitudinal research methodology. Complementary to these training activities, I propose: 1) secondary data analyses of sexual risk behavior and outcomes using data from an ongoing longitudinal study of the offspring of teenage mothers and a study of women with and without borderline personality disorder (BPD); 2) collection of new data on the offspring of teenage mothers during a 16-year assessment and; 3) a new pilot study of common STIs in this sample (offspring of teenage mothers). The proposed research will form the basis for an R01 application in the third year of the award period. My short term goals are to (1) increase knowledge about risk for STIs, including behavioral dysregulation that may underlie risky sex and risk factors associated with risky sex and associated outcomes, (2) learn new methods of measuring risk behavior and adverse reproductive outcomes, including clinical tests for STIs and  event-level assessments, (3) learn more about health disparities associated with race, and (4) develop the research skills that will enable me to become an independent investigator and obtain NIH funding to support my research, specifically longitudinal data analyses. My long-term career goal is to understand the ecological setting for drug use and sexual risk behaviors in vulnerable populations, and how drug use may contribute to significantly higher rates of unintended pregnancies and STIs in African-American youth. The proposed career development training will take place at the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. This department provides an outstanding environment for interdisciplinary training by highly collaborative faculty who are leading experts in their chosen fields. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed research will help identify behavioral risk factors for sexually transmitted infections that are implicated in higher rates of HIV, especially among African-Americans. The results can be used to develop prevention programs aimed at reducing drug use and sexually transmitted infections among vulnerable adolescents and within psychiatric populations.

"Trajectories of Drugs Abuse in High Risk Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to extend the Northwestern Juvenile Project to examine the dynamic relationships among patterns of drug use and disorder, risk and protective factors for drug use and disorder, and adult social role performance as juvenile justice youth age from adolescence to emerging adulthood and young adulthood. This study responds to NIDA's new initiatives on drug abuse, health disparities, and disproportionate minority confinement of African Americans. At year-end 2004, nearly 100,000 juveniles and nearly 2.1 million adults were incarcerated. African Americans comprise 12% of the US population but 40% of incarcerated populations. We are studying a racially/ethnically diverse sample (n=1709; 624 females, 1085 males) in Cook County (Chicago) Illinois, aged 10-18 years at recruitment (1995-1998). Youth are reinterviewed whether they are (re)incarcerated or back in the community. Our goal is to focus on gender differences, racial/ethnic disparities, and the effect of incarceration as we: (1) describe patterns of drug use and disorder --onset, persistence, desistence, and recurrence - as juvenile justice youth age from adolescence to emerging and young adulthood; (2) examine how risk and protective factors (e.g., comorbid mental disorders, adverse life events, availability of illicit drugs) predict, moderate, and mediate patterns of drug use and disorders; and (3) examine the dynamic relationships between patterns of drug use and disorder and adult social role performance (e.g., residential independence [including avoiding incarceration], employment, marriage, parenting, desistance from crime and violence). To analyze the longitudinal data, we will use summary statistics (e.g., prevalence rates, odds ratios), generalized linear mixed-effects models, survival analyses, and Muthen's recently developed extensions of growth mixture models. Extending the Northwestern Juvenile Project allows us to leverage the data already collected to examine the role of incarceration in the development of drug use and disorder, especially among African Americans; to identify risk and protective factors that are potentially malleable; to identify points of intervention at key developmental periods; and to extend theoretical models - developed in general population adolescents -- to correctional populations.           ",Trajectories of Drugs Abuse in High Risk Youth,8132557,R01DA019380,"['Victimization ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' juvenile

"The Development of a Video-Enhanced Drug Prevention Program for Rural Native Hawa    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research has indicated that Native Hawaiian youth have significantly higher rates of drug use than their non-Hawaiian counterparts (e.g., Wong, Klingle, & Price, 2004; Mayeda, Hishinuma, Nishimura, Garcia- Santiago, & Mark, 2006), and that these differences are particularly pronounced in rural settings (Lai & Saka, 2005). Despite these findings, there have been very few drug prevention programs developed and evaluated specifically for these youth (Edwards, Giroux, & Okamoto, in press; Rehuher, Hiramatsu, & Helm, 2008). Therefore, the purpose of this exploratory research proposal is to develop and pilot test curricular components of a video-based, culturally-grounded drug prevention program for rural Native Hawaiian youth. This will be accomplished through three specific aims. AIM 1 is to create 3-5 video vignettes focused on relevant drug related problem situations of rural Hawaiian youth. The vignettes will focus on common and difficult drug offer situations for these youth, as well as the range of responses to each situation, established from prior NIDA- funded research (5 K01 DA019884). AIM 2 is to develop the accompanying drug prevention curricular components to compliment the video vignettes developed in Aim 1. AIM 3 is to pilot test the resulting curricular components for program feasibility and measurement, using a combination of focus group interviews with stakeholders (e.g., Hawaiian youth, youth-serving practitioners) and selected classroom implementation within four middle schools. Comparison of the intervention components against four attentional-control schools will be conducted, in order to estimate effect sizes for a future large-scale, randomized controlled trial (to be implemented as part of a future R01 grant).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Because Hawaiians or part-Hawaiians represent the largest Pacific Islander population in the U.S. (Harris & Jones, 2005) and have been shown to have higher rates of alcohol consumption and smoking compared with other ethnic groups (Office of Minority Health, 2009), research focused on drug prevention of these individuals is important to improve public health both in Hawai'i and on the Mainland U.S. This study actively engages rural communities in the development of the curricular components of a drug prevention intervention for Hawaiian youth, promoting the overall utility and effectiveness of those components. Further, the findings from this study will point to the core content of prevention interventions for Hawaiian youth in rural communities, which may be applicable to other ethnic youth populations in Hawai'i and the Pacific Rim, as well as Native youth populations on the Mainland U.S.           Because Hawaiians or part-Hawaiians represent the largest Pacific Islander population in the U.S. (Harris & Jones, 2005) and have been shown to have higher rates of alcohol consumption and smoking compared with other ethnic groups (Office of Minority Health, 2009), research focused on drug prevention of these individuals is important to improve public health both in Hawai'i and on the Mainland U.S. This study actively engages rural communities in the development of the curricular components of a drug prevention intervention for Hawaiian youth, promoting the overall utility and effectiveness of those components.

"Drug Policy, Incarceration, Community Re-entry, and Race Disparities in HIV/AIDS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a revision of an application submitted last year in response to PAR-07-379, ""Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Disparities."" We will analyze the interconnections between coercive mobility (the massive migration between the criminal justice [CJ] system and the community) produced by US drug policies and race disparities in HIV-related sexual risk among a sample of drug offenders in Connecticut (CT). Further, we will examine whether the association between coercive mobility (CM) and HIV-related sexual risk is affected by the degree of social disorganization in the communities in which these offenders reside. We also will study the feasibility of recruiting and following sexual partners of these individuals to better understand the impacts of CM on partners' HIV-related risk. We hypothesize that CM produces race disparities in HIV risk in a number of distinct ways: 1) Blacks are more likely than Whites to be incarcerated, so HIV-related sexual risk associated with CM can produce race disparities in HIV risk even if the effects of CM are the same for both Blacks and Whites; 2) Blacks are more likely than Whites to reside in communities experiencing the disorganizing impacts of CM, so to the extent that social disorganization exacerbates the effects of CM, it will affect the HIV risks of Blacks to a greater degree than Whites; 3) The sexual partners of Blacks are more likely to come from these same socially disorganized communities, furthering the negative impacts of CM for both returning inmates and their partners, and contributing to race disparities in HIV risk among women; and 4) Blacks are more likely to be penalized by drug policies in ways that increase their movement between prison/jail and the community and their vulnerability to its associated harms. We also hypothesize that we will be able to recruit and retain the sexual partners of study participants and conduct exploratory analyses of the impact of CM on their HIV-related sexual risk. An active Community Advisory Board including policymakers and program administrators will assist us in identifying structural interventions to reduce race disparities in HIV based on study findings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will examine the interconnections among drug policies in the US, coercive mobility (massive migration in and out of the criminal justice system), and race disparities in HIV-related sexual risk. It will suggest potential structural interventions for addressing the movement between prison/jail and the community, including drug policy reforms, with the potential to reduce race disparities in HIV/AIDS.           Narrative This research will examine the interconnections among drug policies in the US, coercive mobility (massive migration in and out of the criminal justice system), and race disparities in HIV-related sexual risk.

"Randomized Trial of IFCBT-HIVPI to Prevent HIV Among Non-Injection Drug Users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a second revision of a competitive renewal R01 proposal of the NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study in response to NIDA PAS-07-115 (Non-injection Dug Abuse and HIV/AIDS). The primary study aim is to evaluate the ability of Integrated Family and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy-HIV Prevention Intervention (IFCBT-HIVPI) to prevent HIV among adult non-injection and injection drug users. Over a 12 week intervention interval, the IFCBT-HIVPI model coordinates the delivery of cognitive- behavioral components during 12 group sessions with a couples and family systems component during 4 couples/family sessions to address HIV risk and protective factors across multiple ecological systems. IFCBT-HIVPI main effects on primary (HIV sexual risk behaviors and HIV drug taking risk behaviors) and secondary (HIV, Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis incidences and legal involvement, academic achievement, and employment) outcome domains will be evaluated. We also seek to elucidate the degree to which the development of attitudinal and behavior change skills targeted by IFCBT-HIVPI (e.g., rational beliefs, problem solving skill, adaptive couples' communication) result in post-intervention reductions of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and HIV risk behaviors. The possibility of effect-modification is also considered with a focus on route of drug administration status (i.e., non-injector/injector), neuropsychological (e.g., executive function), and demographic (i.e., African American/white) factors. The proposed study will randomly assign 360 HIV-negative non-injection and injection drug users recruited from the original NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study sample to experimental (IFCBT-HIVPI) and comparison (Brief Psychoeducation Curriculum on HIV Prevention; BPEC-HIV) conditions. The composition of the original NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study sample provides the basis to stratify the randomized trial sample across gender and two race/ethnicity (i.e., African American and white) groups by route of drug administration status. An assessment battery comprised of a standardized interview on HIV risk behavior, neuropsychological tests, tools to assess attitudes and behavior change skills targeted by IFCBT-HIVPI, drug and STI urine testing, and serologic tests of HIV will be administered before, during, and after the intervention interval across 18-month post-intervention follow-up. Additional preliminary analyses will be conducted on the randomized trial data to: (1) derive session-by-session measures on mechanisms of change targeted by IFCBT-HIVPI via videotape coding methods; (2) characterize mechanisms of change trajectories that may then be evaluated as plausible intervention moderators if present; and (3) estimate intervention cost-effectiveness. The lack of research on science-based prevention interventions for HIV continues to be a serious gap in the literature with recent HIV trends highlighting significant health disparities, particularly among African American non-injection drug users. If successful, the proposed project should help to identify specific attitudinal and behavior change skills targeted by cognitive- behavioral and couples/family systems interventions that foster subsequent reductions in HIV, STIs and HIV risk behaviors among adult drug users at heightened disease risk. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent estimates suggest that a majority of the 40,000 new cases of HIV reported annually in the US are attributable largely to sexual risk behavior associated with non-injection drug use. Additionally, African American drug users exhibit substantial HIV health disparities with African American females being 21 times more likely to contract HIV than white females. The proposed project is designed to address critical gaps in the HIV prevention science field by evaluating the ability of an intervention coordinating cognitive-behavioral and couples/family systems components to prevent HIV among adult drug users at heightened disease risk.           PROJECT NARRATIVE.

"Linking State Data to Identify Unmet Need for Drug Treatment in Women Aged 15-49    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug treatment programs know who they serve, but can only estimate who they do not serve; the inability to accurately measure unmet treatment need, especially among women of reproductive age, is a key barrier to developing interventions to reduce drug-related health consequences for women, their children, and society. This proposal describes an innovative collaboration to link two existing independent state data systems to create a new, unique longitudinal, epidemiologic database that combines drug treatment data with hospital utilization and health outcomes data, to broadly identify drug-related problems and the prevalence of unmet treatment need, and to track drug-related health outcomes among Massachusetts women of reproductive age and their children. For the first time, women in need of drug treatment services who did not receive them will be individually identifiable, allowing for better estimation and description of unmet need. The new linked data will permit assessment of disparities among women with met and unmet treatment need through multiple sources of data, including using a tested algorithm to identify drug diagnoses in hospital data. Moreover, the linked data will allow the examination of subsequent health outcomes among women ages 15-49, and birth outcomes among their children. The two data sources to be linked are: (1) the population-based MA Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal (PELL) data system that includes vital records (births, fetal deaths and deaths); hospital discharge, observational stay, and emergency department visit records; and the MA Birth Defects Registry; and (2) the MA Bureau of Substance Abuse Services (BSAS) treatment data system that contains treatment records for over 25,000 annual admissions of women of reproductive age to BSAS-funded substance abuse treatment facilities. The three broad study aims are: 1. Link PELL data to the MDPH-BSAS Treatment Database and verify linkages. 2. Develop and pilot methods a) among all MA women of reproductive age, identify women with drug abuse or dependence (2002-2007), assess unmet need for treatment services, and characterize disparities in treatment use; b) among MA women who had deliveries (2003-2006), describe the pattern of identification and treatment of drug problems in the periods before, during, and after pregnancy, assess unmet need for drug treatment by timing, and characterize pregnancy outcomes; and c) among MA women with an identified drug problem develop preliminary multivariate models with predisposing and enabling factors predicting receipt of treatment, and, among women who delivered, risk for prematurity. 3. Develop an R01 proposal to describe the impact of substance abuse and treatment on women's and children's health, based on bivariate and multivariate analyses proposed for this study and a tandem NIH/NIAAA study.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This innovative public-private collaboration links two existing independent state data systems (BSAS and PELL) to create a new, unique longitudinal and epidemiologic database that combines drug treatment data with hospital utilization and health outcomes data, to broadly identify drug-related problems and the prevalence of unmet treatment need, and to track drug-related health and birth outcomes among Massachusetts women of reproductive age.

"Collaborative Research on Drug Abuse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This P01 develops and applies state-of-the-art methods to analyze existing but under-utilized drug abuse databases in collaboration with their owners. We address contemporary, theoretical, and applied issues in drug abuse research to understand intersections between substance abuse and AIDS risk behaviors as well as minority and gender-based health disparities. We work with dozens of investigators from drug & social policy, epidemiology, health sciences, medicine, nursing, psychiatry, psychology, public health, and social work who own exciting substance abuse data to develop models that test current theories, especially on epidemiology, prevention, intervention, and treatment of drug abuse, using modern multivariate methods to control for measurement errors, biases, and other confounds. The Models and Methods Project develops psychometric and statistical analytic techniques that hold special promise for improving the quality of drug abuse and AIDS research. The At-Risk Project studies substance abuse related data sets on vulnerable populations (substance abusers, homeless people, individuals who are HIV positive or who have AIDS, victims of domestic abuse, runaways, gang members, and others at high risk for AIDS or drug abuse) with methods to control sampling, measurement, distributional and other biases. The Community Project studies drug abuse etiology, adult consequences, HIV risk, intergenerational processes, general deviance, and related issues in large community-based samples, and develops and tests explanatory theories using models that permit separation of common from specific effects, control for artifacts, etc. The Core Project oversees and integrates all components, hosts visiting scholars, provides computer facilities, and sponsors a mentoring program for disadvantaged students. The substantive part of the Models Project and the At-Risk and Community Projects will be developing and testing integrative theories that can be applied across different populations. The findings from their studies will lead to greater understanding of precursors and concomitants of substance abuse and HIV/AIDS risk and transmission. In turn, these findings will guide development of effective interventions to reduce negative health outcomes and treatment disparities in community, ethnic, and vulnerable populations, and provide guidance on how these may be alleviated.     ",Collaborative Research on Drug Abuse,8119008,P01DA001070,[''],NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P01,2011,1041326,0.06373110537308126
"Incarceration Effects on Prevention of Drug Use, STI-HIV and Recidivism Incarcerated women are often affected by childhood abuse, violence, and other difficult life circumstances throughout their life course, and typically come from disproportionately disadvantaged neighborhoods. However, relatively less research has examined how neighborhood characteristics and incarceration interact with inmates' risk factors. Although several criminal justice studies demonstrated that excessive incarceration may exacerbate community disadvantages and instability as a large proportion of residents constantly move between jail and community, the impact of neighborhood disadvantages on inmates' health outcomes, such as drug use and sexual risks have not been examined. Furthermore, while the rate of female incarceration has steadily increased over the past 20 years, previous studies predominantly concern with men, and women's unique life trajectories of incarceration, sexual risks, and drug use have been less understood. The study proposes to examine the impact and consequences of incarceration on the patterns of substance use, risky sexual behaviors, and recidivism among female inmates who are returning to the community from a large urban jail. The proposed conceptual model will be tested explaining the ecological factors associated with incarceration, and the impact of incarceration on drug use, STls/HlV risks, and recidivism among female inmates. To achieve the objectives, the proposed study will conduct: 1) qualitative in-depth interviews with women in jail exploring their experience with incarceration, changes in social networks and support, health  concerns, health care and social services utilization, expected challenges upon release, and needs for successful transition to community life; 2) face-to-face longitudinal surveys with a cohort of female inmates at three time points (baseline in jail, and two weeks and three months post-release) to examine primary outcomes (relapse to drug use, risks for STIs/HlV infection, recidivism), secondary outcomes, and mediators (social network, social support); and 3) multi-level analysis and mapping to explore the effects of neighborhood disadvantage and instability, the rates of incarceration and STIs on women's outcomes. Incarcerated women are often from the poor, minority, urban populations who are most affected by drug  abuse and HIV. The rate of female incarceration has dramatically increased in recent years, while the  majority of them return to the community along with their health problems. Findings of the research wilt help  better understand incarcerated women's complex health, socioeconomic issues and community context,  which may contribute to reducing health disparities among women living in disadvantaged neighborhoods.","Incarceration Effects on Prevention of Drug Use, STI-HIV and Recidivism",8118597,R00DA024012,"['Alcohol dependence ', ' alcohol-dependent ', ' alcohol dependency ', ' alcohol addiction ', ' Poverty ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Social Network ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' offender ', ' criminal offender ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' service utilization ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' secondary outcome ', ' Employment ', ' Prisoner ', ' jail inmate ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' human capital ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' primary outcome ', ' Probability ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Life ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Maps ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data ', ' Relapse ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Pattern ', ' Methods ', ' Reporting ', ' Infection ', ' Modeling ', ' cohort ', ' high risk ', ' Health ', ' Woman ', ' Risk ', ' improved ', ' Characteristics ', ' Complex ', ' Female ', ' Testing ', ' Exhibits ', ' experience ', ' Affect ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Time ', ' Outcome ', ' Minority ', ' Goals ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Interview ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Individual ', ' Communities ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Child Abuse ', ' Childhood Abuse ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' recidivism ', ' Jail ', ' community living ', ' Urban Population ', ' Social Health Services ', ' reincarceration ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R00,2011,238693,0.08478374343868396
"Drug Abuse and Crime Across the Life Course in an African American Population    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans are disproportionately represented in national crime statistics for arrests and incarceration as well as victimization, particularly for drug-related and violent offenses. Their involvement in crime often represents only one component of a well-recognized cluster of negative experiences and circumstances including drug use problems, socioeconomic disadvantage and poor physical and mental health, sometimes evident in childhood. The cost to individuals, families, and society is enormous, yet we know little about the development of these patterns across the life course. Despite these evident disparities, few studies have examined the development of drug use and criminal behaviors over time within African American community populations, especially into mid adulthood. We intend to study the timing and sources of risk over the life span to better understand the disparities in health and social consequences related to criminal justice issues among African Americans. To that end, we request support to analyze existing crime and drug data covering 35 years in the lives of a cohort of first grade, African American children from inner city Chicago. This prospective developmental study (the Woodlawn project) began in 1966-67, with the most recent follow up in 2002-3 at ages 42-43, and interim assessments in adolescence and early adulthood (age 32-33). The study population had high levels of drug use and criminal activity in adulthood. In the proposed project, we will focus on interrelationships of drug abuse and crime, examining predictors and consequences of drug abuse, criminal activity, and involvement with the criminal justice system. Using data from cohort members, mothers, interviewers, and official criminal records, we will identify 1) patterns of drug use and criminal behaviors over the life course; 2) individual and contextual predictors of later drug use, criminal activity/behaviors, and involvement with the criminal justice system; 3) social, economic, and health consequences of drug use, criminal behaviors, and involvement in the criminal justice system. Of particular interest is how drug use in adolescence and early adulthood relates to the risk of being arrested and incarcerated and, conversely, how early arrests and incarceration influence later drug use and criminal behaviors. This information will further our understanding of the etiology and consequences of crime and drug use into mid adulthood, and inform the design of interventions at various stages along the life course.             ",Drug Abuse and Crime Across the Life Course in an African American Population,8013895,R01DA022366,"['socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Victimization ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Records ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Chicago ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Social Functioning ', ' health economics ', ' statistics ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' intervention program ', ' Gender ', ' inner city ', ' Time Study ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Population Study ', ' Societies ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' Mothers ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' first grade ', ' Crime ', ' social integration ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' cost ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Female ', ' Prevention program ', ' male ', ' Health ', ' prospective ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Time ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cohort ', ' Behavior ', ' Population ', ' Interviewer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pattern ', ' Complex ', ' Outcome ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Family ', ' Individual ', ' base ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Affect ', ' Research ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' Age ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Address ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Learning ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Staging ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Mediating ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' member ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Risk ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Risk Factors ', ' experience ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Communities ', ' Woman ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Sampling ', ' social ', ' Data ', ' interest ', ' Source ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' criminal behavior ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' ']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,475527,0.19747166288874865
"Understanding Racial Disparities in Teen Methamphetamine Use Despite a voluminous number of studies documenting the nature and extent of teen methamphetamine use in the United States, relatively few studies have provided a comprehensive portrait of the risk and protective factors associated with adolescent meth use. One salient omission is the lack of studies that provide insight into the well-documented race gap in teen methamphetamine use: Native American teens are at much greater risk of use and abuse of methamphetamines than non-Hispanic whites. This fact is exacerbated by evidence that meth use is associated with a heightened risk of engaging in behaviors such as IV drug use and unprotected sexual practices that are correlated with contracting HIV/AIDS. Indeed, research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides evidence that Native Americans are at a heightened risk of contracting HIV/AIDS relative to non-Hispanic whites. Clearly, there are important gaps in our knowledge and understanding of why methamphetamine use/abuse is distributed differentially among adolescents, and there is a need for research that specifically focuses on explaining the ""race-gap"" between Native American and non Hispanic white teens in America with regards to both meth use and the associations between meth use and behaviors associated with risk of exposure to HIV/AIDS. The present study, by addressing these knowledge gaps, will facilitate understanding into why the race gap in such behavior exists and can direct targeted intervention and prevention programs that address such health disparities between Native American and non-Hispanic white teens. The long-term goal of the research team is to continue to explore how racial and economic stratification serves to produce health disparities, in order to reduce race and economic based disparities. The objective of this application is threefold: a) to identify the social risk and protective factors associated with both meth use generally and those factors that serve to delineate racial/ethnic differences in use specifically; b) to apply the stress process model/General Strain Theory to expand our understanding of both meth use and racial differences in use; and c) to explore the association between meth use and risky sexual behaviors and how race serves as a potential moderator. The central hvpothesis of this application is that differences in stress exposure will predict both individual and race-based variation in meth use, abuse, and related risky behaviors (IV drug use/unprotected sex) with personal and social resources serving to moderate the stresssubstance use association. The plan is to fill this knowledge gap by pursuing the following two specific aims: a) utilize the stress process modei/GST framework to identify the social risk and protective factors associated with the initiation, use, and abuse/dependence of meth use among both males and females, non-Hispanic whites and Native American adolescents who attend public schools in Montana; and b) evaluate the stress process modei/GST framework as an explanation for predicting risky sexual practices and the potential role of race and meth use as moderators. In order to accomplish these objectives, one wave of data will be collected, entailing the use of a self-administered questionnaire of a targeted sample of approximately 900 ninth and tenth grade boys and girls attending three high schools in Montana. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide fundamental knowledge necessary in order to construct efficacious interventions and prevention efforts designed to reduce the adolescent Native American-white race gap in meth use, and risky behaviors associated with HIV/AIDS.  This proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide fundamental knowledge necessary in order to construct efficacious interventions and prevention efforts designed to reduce the adolescent Native Americanwhite race gap in meth use, IV drug use and risky sexual behaviors associated with contracting HIVIAIDS. This research will provide a vertical step in understanding how the stress process modei/GST can be utilized to understand and redress racial differences in methamphetamine use and its association with risky behaviors (sexual and IV drug use) related to HIV/AIDS transmission and should facilitate additional research into understanding the Native American-white race gap in other substance use and related HIV/AIDS associated risk behaviors. It is also expected that the present study would provide further clarification and refinement of the stress process and GST theories utility for explaining drug use. Further, the present research could facilitate the development of general prevention and intervention programs beyond those that currently are employed as the dominant strategy to reduce teen meth use, such as the notable Montana Meth Project. Rather than replace such programs, the development of new programs could supplement existing prevention efforts by approaching the problem from a different theoretical orientation.",Understanding Racial Disparities in Teen Methamphetamine Use,8075602,R03DA029212,"['racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Methamphetamine dependence ', ' methamphetamine addiction ', ' meth dependence [{C1533217}] ', ' meth addiction ', ' METH dependence ', ' METH addiction [{C1533217}] ', ' Prevention program ', ' Stratification ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Intravenous ', ' statistics ', ' Americas ', ' stressor ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Anxiety ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Stress ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Economics ', ' Dependence ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Area ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Female ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' girls ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Utility Theories ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' Individual ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Literature ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' social ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' United States ', ' Nature ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' insight ', ' Health ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Process ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Data ', ' male ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling ', ' Behavior ', ' Respondent ', ' programs ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Gender ', ' Address ', ' Goals ', ' response ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Life ', ' Schools ', ' Environment ', ' theories ', ' Diagnosis ', ' County ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Modeling ', ' Prevention ', ' Work ', ' base ', ' Investigation ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Exposure to ', ' Outcome ', ' Fostering ', ' Science ', ' methamphetamine abuse ', ' Legal ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Paranoia ', ' Paranoid Disorders ', ' Inequality ', ' Portraits ', ' ninth grade ', ' high school freshman ', ' tenth grade ', ' high school sophomore ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Native Americans ', ' intravenous drug use ', ' Cocaine ', ' 8-Azabicyclo(3.2.1)octane-2-carboxylic acid, 3-(benzoyloxy)-8-methyl-, methyl ester, (1R-(exo,exo))- ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' boys ', ' Program Development ', ' Methamphetamine ', ' N-Methylamphetamine ', ' Methylamphetamine ', ' Desoxyephedrine ', ' Deoxyephedrine ', ' Crystal Meth ', ' Benzeneethanamine, N,alpha-dimethyl-, (S)- ', ' rural area ', ' Sociology ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Montana ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' criminal behavior ', ' Needle Sharing ', ' Syringe Sharing ', ' Needlesharing ', ' high school ', ' intervention program ', ' ']",NIDA,MONTANA STATE UNIVERSITY - BOZEMAN,R03,2011,69113,0.034103952870873554
"Drug Abuse, Incarceration & Health Disparities in HIV/AIDS: A Longitudinal Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this project is to address how disproportionate confinement of racial/ethnic minorities-especially African Americans-affects health disparities in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. African Americans comprise only 13% of the general population, but about 40% of incarcerated youth and adults and 50% of new cases of HIV/AIDS. Yet, large multisite national longitudinal studies of HIV/AIDS focus on high- risk samples such as men who have sex with men (MACS), women infected with HIV and other ""at-risk"" females (WIHS), and infected women and their infants (WITS). These studies do not include adolescents, do not sample correctional populations, and do not examine the effect of incarceration on HIV/AIDS. Most studies of incarcerated populations are cross-sectional and provide limited information on the effects of incarceration.  To continue to address this key omission in the literature, we propose to extend the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a longitudinal study of 1829 juvenile justice youth, enrolled at age 10-18 years (1172 males, 657 females; 1005 African Americans, 296 non-Hispanic whites, 524 Hispanics, and 4 ""other"" race/ethnicity). Currently, the HIV/AIDS component of the project (RO1 DA022953) includes only a subsample (n=743) and 10-, 11-, 12-, and 13-year follow-up interviews. We now propose to (1) study the entire sample (originally 1829, now 1678); (2) conduct 3 additional annual interviews (14-, 15-, and 16-year follow-ups), at which time participants will be aged 26-34 years; (3) collect official records to cross-validate self-reported data (on STI status, arrests, incarceration history, and services received); (4) test the entire sample for HIV infection, chlamydia, and gonorrhea; and (5) administer a new module on incarceration, release, and re-entry. Participants are re-interviewed whether they are re-incarcerated or back in the community. Using data collected in prior phases and the additional interviews, we will examine patterns of drug use, drug use disorder, HIV/AIDS risk and infection from adolescence (ages 10-17 years) to emerging adulthood (ages 18-24 years) and young adulthood (age 25 and older). Our Specific Aims focus on how incarceration, release, and re-entry (e.g., age[s] incarcerated, number of incarcerations, length of incarcerations, amount of time spent in the community between incarcerations) affect the following: (1) drug use behaviors (including the number and types of substances used, frequency of use, and route of administration) and drug use disorders (onset, persistence, desistance, and recurrence); (2) HIV/AIDS sex risk behaviors (including unprotected anal or vaginal receptive sex and trading sex for drugs) and injection-risk behaviors; (3) prevalence and incidence of HIV infection and other STIs; (4) the relationship between patterns of drug use and disorder and HIV/AIDS risk behaviors, especially how risk and protective factors predict, moderate, and mediate these relationships.  This study responds to the initiatives of NIDA, NIAAA, and other NIH institutes to reduce health disparities in HIV/AIDS in minority populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial/ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately from the HIV/AIDS epidemic and are disproportionately incarcerated. To address health disparities in HIV/AIDS, we must study correctional populations, which increased from nearly 1.8 million in 1997 to over 2.2 million by mid-year 2006. The proposed study will guide public health policy by investigating how incarceration affects the development of substance use and disorder and HIV/AIDS; identifying risk and protective factors that are potentially malleable; identifying points of intervention during key developmental periods; and extending current conceptual models to include incarceration, release, and reentry.","Drug Abuse,

"Couple HIV prevention for drug-involved male offenders: An Effectiveness Trial     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study responds to PA-09-236 entitled ""HIV/AIDS, Drug Use, and Vulnerable Populations."" This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will rigorously evaluate the implementation, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a couple-based integrated HIV/STI and drug abuse prevention intervention (Connect II) with drug-involved male offenders charged with misdemeanors and their primary female sexual partners, implemented by frontline providers in Criminal Court, Community Court or Probation (CCP) sites in the Bronx, NY, compared to CCP standard treatment of care services (TAU). The primary outcomes are biologically confirmed sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and self-reported condom use. This study will yield important data on implementation factors associated with effectiveness of the proposed intervention in real world resource-constrained criminal justice settings. The proposed CCP study sites are located in the South Bronx, the poorest Congressional District in the U.S. with 96% of residents identifying as Black or Latino. The South Bronx has an HIV prevalence rate of 2.6%. Research has found that 12% of men on probation in New York City are HIV positive. Though the criminal justice system is recognized as the epicenter of the epidemic in the U.S., few, if any, HIV prevention interventions have been developed for the huge number of male offenders under community supervision who represent 90% of the corrections population. No HIV/STI prevention services are currently provided at the proposed CCP sites. The proposed intervention is designed to address this critical gap in services. Connect II was found to be efficacious among drug-involved couples in reducing risky drug and sexual behaviors and drug use. In the proposed study we aim to advance the knowledge of implementation science by testing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Connect II delivered by frontline providers in the real world settings of CCP sites with 240 drug-involved male offenders and their female partners (N=480 participants). Eligible couples will be randomly assigned to either (1) a 4-session Connect II delivered to both partners together + TAU delivered to male participant alone, or (2) a TAU control condition delivered to the male participant. Repeated assessments will occur at baseline and 3, 6, and 12-months post intervention. The study will be conducted by Dr. Nabila El-Bassel, Dr. Louisa Gilbert, and an investigative team from Columbia University in collaboration with Michael Rempel from the Center for Court Innovation and the New York City Department of Probation.

"The Development of a Video-Enhanced Drug Prevention Program for Rural Native Hawa    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research has indicated that Native Hawaiian youth have significantly higher rates of drug use than their non-Hawaiian counterparts (e.g., Wong, Klingle, & Price, 2004; Mayeda, Hishinuma, Nishimura, Garcia- Santiago, & Mark, 2006), and that these differences are particularly pronounced in rural settings (Lai & Saka, 2005). Despite these findings, there have been very few drug prevention programs developed and evaluated specifically for these youth (Edwards, Giroux, & Okamoto, in press; Rehuher, Hiramatsu, & Helm, 2008).

"The Logics for HIV Risk among Street-Based Heroin Injectors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a theoretically and ethnographically informed model of ""HIV risk environment"" for public health intervention by identifying the key structural forces, institutional processes, and socio-cultural constraints that shape HIV behaviors among inner-city street-based drug users. We will examine the social processes that drive the logics for HIV transmission behaviors among street-based injection drug users (IDUs) in two cities, Philadelphia and San Francisco, that span a strategic range of the demographic, economic, political, and cultural factors affecting inner-city poverty in the United States. Building on long-term, continuous participant-observation ethnographic fieldwork in the shooting encampments of ethnically and generationally bounded social networks of heroin injectors and crack smokers in San Francisco as well as pilot research in Philadelphia at open-air drug markets and shooting galleries, we will document patterns of: 1) law enforcement and criminal justice; 2) poverty and income generating opportunities (including legal and illegal labor markets and public subsidies); 3) illegal drug markets and polydrug availability; 4) racialized ethnic boundaries and conflicts; 5) gender/sexuality boundaries that delimit social networks; 6) oppositional sub-cultural identities that trap IDUs into counterproductive relationships with the services that are meant to help or contain them; 7) violence and insecurity; 8) access to clinical care, public health prevention messages, and social services; 9) access to ecological and basic survival needs infrastructures including transportation systems, food, and shelter from inclement weather. An experienced ethnographic team in both cities will collect data on individual-level HIV risk behaviors at fieldsites that we have successfully maintained on the parent grant for more than 12 years in San Francisco and recently established in Philadelphia (core N of each network=15-20 at any given time, peripheral N=10-15 in each fieldsite; 2 sites in Philadephia and 2 in San Francisco). The project will administer a set of procedures for cross-methodological collaboration with epidemiologists who are the Principal Investigators on long-term, large quantitative data sets documenting street-based drug users in both cities. This will enable us to examine the representativity of our ethnographic data on individual street-based drug users and to explore the generalizability of our analysis of the larger social structural processes that promote or constrain risky injection and sexual practices. It will also bring one of the largest and oldest NIDA-funded data sets on IDUs in San Francisco, an exceptionally high-tech, wealthy, culturally diverse, and liberal city into an illustrative contrast and dialogue with another large NIDA-supported quantitative data set of street-based drug users in the city of Philadelphia, one of the nation's poorest deindustrialized metropolises, with a declining population of largely native-born white, Latino (primarily Puerto Rican) and African American ethnic groups.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Untangling the complex web of factors that render inner city poverty environments exceptionally risky for HIV infection and addiction will help public health outreach workers and clinicians develop more innovative structural and targeted interventions to reach larger numbers of low income high-risk populations with more effective and convincing messages. Upstream interventions that alter neighborhood-level risk environments can cost-effectively encourage drug users to change their behaviors for pragmatic reasons without necessarily requiring a conscious or willful choice. Our findings will also identify strategic institutions and programs that often operate at cross purposes or fail to coordinate with public health HIV risk reduction priorities (including law enforcement, criminal justice, employment training, public housing, food kitchens, shelters, schools, and churches) but which represent productive sites for multi-service HIV prevention interventions.

This proposal reflects a collaborative initiative between Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center and the National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse (NHSN), based at the University of Miami. The annual scientific conferences help to accomplish the NHSN mission of fostering both interdisciplinary and translational research, by promoting dialogue between biologic, social, behavioral, and cultural scientists and disseminating findings back to the field. Previous conferences, supported through a NIDA-funded contract, have been an effective platform for developing the aims of the NHSN, with particular emphasis on mentoring and training Hispanic graduate students and early career scientists.    The aims of the conferences will be: A) to advance science in the area of drug abuse research and its co-morbid conditions, particularly as it impacts on the Hispanic population. It will promote bidirectional translational research ranging from bench to community and a trans-disciplinary cross-fertilization of ideas among scientists from all fields of drug abuse helping to establish future research priorities. B) To foster the development of Hispanic researchers, with emphasis in areas related to drug abuse research by facilitating the development of integrated and continuous collaborative and mentoring networks. Funding is requested to support participation for 50 trainees/early career scientists and 20 research scientists presenting in the scientific panels. An average of 150 participants, representing the field from the national and international scientific communities, are expected at each yearly conference, including members of the global research community whose interests encompass a multifaceted approach to understanding the factors underlying health disparities as they pertain to drug use and abuse ranging from epidemiology to environmental health, psychology, sociology, health policy, neuroscience and other biomedical sciences, and epigenetics.    The first conference proposed ""Integrating Population, Laboratory, and Clinical Sciences in Minority Health"" will be hosted by the University of Miami, from December 1-3, 2009. The format of the conference aims to provide ample opportunity for discussion, networking, and collaboration discussions as well as development of new ideas related to training and mentoring of the next generation of researchers in the field of drug abuse. The themes, scientific content, and program for each conference will be developed by a Scientific Conference committee comprised of NHSN members, NIH officials, and federal liaisons. The themes will be directly related to NIDA's strategic plan and the NIH blueprint, addressing timely topics and developing challenges in the field. Project narrative  The Annual National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse Conference provides multidisciplinary scientists in drug abuse and related fields interested in advancing science, particularly as it pertains to the Hispanic population, to have a collegial exchange providing a forum for discussion and dissemination of research findings and an opportunity for networking and mentoring trainees in the area of drug abuse research. This unique opportunity will promote bidirectional translational research ranging from bench to community and a trans-disciplinary cross-fertilization of ideas among scientists from all fields of drug abuse.

"""African American Offenders: Drug Use, Mental Health and HIV Risk""     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The primary goal of this K08 award is to further develop a productive independent research career in drug abuse research. The training and career development plan will enhance Dr. Stevens-Watkins's research experience in primary data collection with prisoners focused on drug use, mental health, and HIV thus resulting in the clarification of the specific aims of an R01 submission in years 4 and 5. The proposed training objectives are: (1) to receive training in the epidemiology of drug abuse, mental health, and HIV as they relate to health disparities among African Americans; (2) to further develop expertise in research with special populations, biostatistics, and advanced quantitative analyses including non-linear, categorical models, and structural equation modeling; (3) to use the data collected in the proposed research plan as pilot data for an R01 research proposal. The specified training goals are aligned with the research aims and compliment the clinical experience of the candidate. Dr. Stevens-Watkins will be sponsored by her established mentors, Drs. Carl Leukefeld and Carrie Oser, both with expertise in drug abuse and HIV research. Of high significance, HIV has recently been termed a ""crisis"" in the African American community. The overall goal of the proposed research plan is to better understand the complex and dynamic relationship between drug use, mental health, and HIV risk among African American male prisoners nearing community re-entry. The specific aims are (1) to explore drug use, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and HIV risk behaviors among African American male inmates by conducting a thorough literature review and devising an analytical model using biostatics multivariate analytic techniques with available data; (2) to identify prevalence, incidence, and predictors of drug use disorders, anxiety, depressive disorders and HIV sexual risk behaviors among 205 incarcerated African American men; (3) to examine the knowledge, patterns, and perceived cultural and community barriers to utilizing individual and health resources and their relationship to substance abuse recovery and HIV risk behaviors among 205 African American men upon release from prison. Baseline data will be collected in prison and follow-up data collection will occur when participants have been released in the community after 3-months. The proposed research plan will offer HIV testing and counseling to an at-risk population that has historically been difficult to engage in research and HIV testing, subsequently significantly impacting public health by possibly preventing the spread of HIV. The candidate's immediate career goals include published manuscripts and R01 funding by the end of K08 funding, with an ultimate career goal of becoming an independent clinical drug abuse researcher. This proposal includes an outstanding mentoring team, as well as a feasible training and research plan utilizing resources offered by both Spalding University and the University of Kentucky.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed project has significant public health implications for reducing the spread of HIV among the African American community by offering testing and by targeting men exiting prison, re-entering the community. The proposed project will generate an improved understanding of the complex relationship between drug use, mental health, and HIV risk among an at-risk group.                           The proposed project has significant public health implications for reducing the spread of HIV among the African American community by offering testing and by targeting men exiting prison, re-entering the community.

"Randomized Trial of IFCBT-HIVPI to Prevent HIV Among Non-Injection Drug Users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a second revision of a competitive renewal R01 proposal of the NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study in response to NIDA PAS-07-115 (Non-injection Dug Abuse and HIV/AIDS). The primary study aim is to evaluate the ability of Integrated Family and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy-HIV Prevention Intervention (IFCBT-HIVPI) to prevent HIV among adult non-injection and injection drug users. Over a 12 week intervention interval, the IFCBT-HIVPI model coordinates the delivery of cognitive- behavioral components during 12 group sessions with a couples and family systems component during 4 couples/family sessions to address HIV risk and protective factors across multiple ecological systems. IFCBT-HIVPI main effects on primary (HIV sexual risk behaviors and HIV drug taking risk behaviors) and secondary (HIV, Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis incidences and legal involvement, academic achievement, and employment) outcome domains will be evaluated. We also seek to elucidate the degree to which the development of attitudinal and behavior change skills targeted by IFCBT-HIVPI (e.g., rational beliefs, problem solving skill, adaptive couples' communication) result in post-intervention reductions of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and HIV risk behaviors. The possibility of effect-modification is also considered with a focus on route of drug administration status (i.e., non-injector/injector), neuropsychological (e.g., executive function), and demographic (i.e., African American/white) factors. The proposed study will randomly assign 360 HIV-negative non-injection and injection drug users recruited from the original NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study sample to experimental (IFCBT-HIVPI) and comparison (Brief Psychoeducation Curriculum on HIV Prevention; BPEC-HIV) conditions. The composition of the original NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study sample provides the basis to stratify the randomized trial sample across gender and two race/ethnicity (i.e., African American and white) groups by route of drug administration status. An assessment battery comprised of a standardized interview on HIV risk behavior, neuropsychological tests, tools to assess attitudes and behavior change skills targeted by IFCBT-HIVPI, drug and STI urine testing, and serologic tests of HIV will be administered before, during, and after the intervention interval across 18-month post-intervention follow-up. Additional preliminary analyses will be conducted on the randomized trial data to: (1) derive session-by-session measures on mechanisms of change targeted by IFCBT-HIVPI via videotape coding methods; (2) characterize mechanisms of change trajectories that may then be evaluated as plausible intervention moderators if present; and (3) estimate intervention cost-effectiveness. The lack of research on science-based prevention interventions for HIV continues to be a serious gap in the literature with recent HIV trends highlighting significant health disparities, particularly among African American non-injection drug users. If successful, the proposed project should help to identify specific attitudinal and behavior change skills targeted by cognitive- behavioral and couples/family systems interventions that foster subsequent reductions in HIV, STIs and HIV risk behaviors among adult drug users at heightened disease risk. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent estimates suggest that a majority of the 40,000 new cases of HIV reported annually in the US are attributable largely to sexual risk behavior associated with non-injection drug use. Additionally, African American drug users exhibit substantial HIV health disparities with African American females being 21 times more likely to contract HIV than white females. The proposed project is designed to address critical gaps in the HIV prevention science field by evaluating the ability of an intervention coordinating cognitive-behavioral and couples/family systems components to prevent HIV among adult drug users at heightened disease risk.

"Drug Abuse, Incarceration & Health Disparities in HIV/AIDS: A Longitudinal Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to address how disproportionate confinement of racial/ethnic minorities-especially African Americans-affects health disparities in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. African Americans comprise only 13% of the general population, but about 40% of incarcerated youth and adults and 50% of new cases of HIV/AIDS. Yet, large multisite national longitudinal studies of HIV/AIDS focus on high- risk samples such as men who have sex with men (MACS), women infected with HIV and other ""at-risk"" females (WIHS), and infected women and their infants (WITS). These studies do not include adolescents, do not sample correctional populations, and do not examine the effect of incarceration on HIV/AIDS. Most studies of incarcerated populations are cross-sectional and provide limited information on the effects of incarceration. To continue to address this key omission in the literature, we propose to extend the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a longitudinal study of 1829 juvenile justice youth, enrolled at age 10-18 years (1172 males, 657 females; 1005 African Americans, 296 non-Hispanic whites, 524 Hispanics, and 4 ""other"" race/ethnicity). Currently, the HIV/AIDS component of the project (RO1 DA022953) includes only a subsample (n=743) and 10-, 11-, 12-, and 13-year follow-up interviews. We now propose to (1) study the entire sample (originally 1829, now 1678); (2) conduct 3 additional annual interviews (14-, 15-, and 16-year follow-ups), at which time participants will be aged 26-34 years; (3) collect official records to cross-validate self-reported data (on STI status, arrests, incarceration history, and services received); (4) test the entire sample for HIV infection, chlamydia, and gonorrhea; and (5) administer a new module on incarceration, release, and re-entry. Participants are re-interviewed whether they are re-incarcerated or back in the community. Using data collected in prior phases and the additional interviews, we will examine patterns of drug use, drug use disorder, HIV/AIDS risk and infection from adolescence (ages 10-17 years) to emerging adulthood (ages 18-24 years) and young adulthood (age 25 and older). Our Specific Aims focus on how incarceration, release, and re-entry (e.g., age[s] incarcerated, number of incarcerations, length of incarcerations, amount of time spent in the community between incarcerations) affect the following: (1) drug use behaviors (including the number and types of substances used, frequency of use, and route of administration) and drug use disorders (onset, persistence, desistance, and recurrence); (2) HIV/AIDS sex risk behaviors (including unprotected anal or vaginal receptive sex and trading sex for drugs) and injection-risk behaviors; (3) prevalence and incidence of HIV infection and other STIs; (4) the relationship between patterns of drug use and disorder and HIV/AIDS risk behaviors, especially how risk and protective factors predict, moderate, and mediate these relationships. This study responds to the initiatives of NIDA, NIAAA, and other NIH institutes to reduce health disparities in HIV/AIDS in minority populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial/ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately from the HIV/AIDS epidemic and are disproportionately incarcerated. To address health disparities in HIV/AIDS, we must study correctional populations, which increased from nearly 1.8 million in 1997 to over 2.2 million by mid-year 2006. The proposed study will guide public health policy by investigating how incarceration affects the development of substance use and disorder and HIV/AIDS; identifying risk and protective factors that are potentially malleable; identifying points of intervention during key developmental periods; and extending current conceptual models to include incarceration, release, and reentry.","Drug Abuse,

"Drug Policy, Incarceration, Community Re-entry, and Race Disparities in HIV/AIDS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a revision of an application submitted last year in response to PAR-07-379, ""Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Disparities."" We will analyze the interconnections between coercive mobility (the massive migration between the criminal justice [CJ] system and the community) produced by US drug policies and race disparities in HIV-related sexual risk among a sample of drug offenders in Connecticut (CT). Further, we will examine whether the association between coercive mobility (CM) and HIV-related sexual risk is affected by the degree of social disorganization in the communities in which these offenders reside. We also will study the feasibility of recruiting and following sexual partners of these individuals to better understand the impacts of CM on partners' HIV-related risk. We hypothesize that CM produces race disparities in HIV risk in a number of distinct ways: 1) Blacks are more likely than Whites to be incarcerated, so HIV-related sexual risk associated with CM can produce race disparities in HIV risk even if the effects of CM are the same for both Blacks and Whites; 2) Blacks are more likely than Whites to reside in communities experiencing the disorganizing impacts of CM, so to the extent that social disorganization exacerbates the effects of CM, it will affect the HIV risks of Blacks to a greater degree than Whites; 3) The sexual partners of Blacks are more likely to come from these same socially disorganized communities, furthering the negative impacts of CM for both returning inmates and their partners, and contributing to race disparities in HIV risk among women; and 4) Blacks are more likely to be penalized by drug policies in ways that increase their movement between prison/jail and the community and their vulnerability to its associated harms. We also hypothesize that we will be able to recruit and retain the sexual partners of study participants and conduct exploratory analyses of the impact of CM on their HIV-related sexual risk. An active Community Advisory Board including policymakers and program administrators will assist us in identifying structural interventions to reduce race disparities in HIV based on study findings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will examine the interconnections among drug policies in the US, coercive mobility (massive migration in and out of the criminal justice system), and race disparities in HIV-related sexual risk. It will suggest potential structural interventions for addressing the movement between prison/jail and the community, including drug policy reforms, with the potential to reduce race disparities in HIV/AIDS.

"Prescription drugs misuse and risky sexual behaviors among YMSM in Philadelphia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-medical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD), i.e. opioids, tranquilizers, or stimulants, is a serious and growing public health problem in the U.S. Most data on NMUPD among young adults is limited to the heterosexual college population while significant knowledge gaps exist regarding NMUPD among young men who have sex with men (YMSM). Given the well-established intersection of drug use and risky sexual behaviors and high rates of HIV infections in YMSM, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between these drugs and physical, sexual and psychological health of YMSM. YMSM have unique concerns for health risks, such as depression, suicide, bullying, victimization, homelessness, and homophobia, but little is known of their intersection with NMUPD. Many YMSM experience normative pressures that encourage risky behaviors. At the same time, some forms of social support and resilience may buffer against negative effects of stressors. Significant gaps exist in our understanding of how these factors relate to problematic patterns of NMUPD, and whether they modify engagement in risky sexual behaviors. The objective of this study is to contribute directly to our understanding of the social factors that influence NMUPD and risky sexual behaviors among YMSM. The long-term goal of the study is to guide public health practitioners towards developing strategies that will prevent negative effects of NMUPD on YMSM, including reducing disparities in rates of HIV infection among YMSM. The study will investigate the central hypothesis of a deleterious relationship between NMUPD and physical, sexual, and psychological health of YMSM. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1: Determine patterns of NMUPD and risky sexual behavior among YMSM in Philadelphia; Aim 2: Determine the risk and protective factors contributing to NMUPD and risky sexual behavior among YMSM; Aim 3: Explore the social contexts of NMPUD. Aims 1 and 2 will be addressed by recruiting 190 YMSM ages 18-29 in Philadelphia who have recently misused prescription drugs. Aim 3 will be addressed by selecting a subsample of 25 YMSM for a qualitative study. This approach is innovative because it utilizes a conceptual framework that combines a minority stress model and theories of social norms, social support, and resilience; it focuses on a critical cohort of under-researched, hard-to-reach population; and it employs two research methodologies. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance and expand our understanding of the effects of an emerging phenomena (i.e., prescription drug misuse) on adverse consequences of sexual activity. It will also contribute to a better understanding of the role of social determinants on dug use and risky sexual behavior.

"Social networks and HIV risk among rural drug users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is in response to PA-06-478, ""Research on Rural Mental Health and Drug Abuse Disorders"". One of the research areas highlighted by this PA is the examination of rural HIV transmission using social network analysis. The overall goal of the study is to examine the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors for HIV and other blood borne infections (BBIs) such as hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) among rural Appalachian drug users using social network analysis and multilevel modeling. HIV continues to be a major public health problem in the United States, especially among drug users. However, little is known about HIV in rural areas in which there are marked health disparities. Therefore, given that studies among urban drug users have found that social network indicators are robust predictors of HIV risk, both social network and individual characteristics will be measured for their association with HIV risk among rural drug users. The specific aims are: 1) To determine the prevalence and incidence of HIV, HCV and HBV among rural injection and non- injection drug users; 2) To examine HIV and other BBI risk among rural injection and non-injection drug users; and 3) To examine longitudinal changes in rural HIV, HCV and HBV risk at 6-months, 12-months and 18- months post-baseline. To meet these aims, a sample 500 rural injection and non-injection drug users will be recruited using respondent driven sampling (RDS). In addition to biologic testing for HIV, HCV and HBV, rural participants will be given an interviewer-administered questionnaire pertaining to their social networks (drug, sexual and support networks), sociodemographics, drug use, HIV risk behaviors, psychiatric diagnoses, intravention and norms. Since individuals will be nested within networks, data will be analyzed using multilevel random effects regression that allows for the simultaneous examination of social network and individual-level risk. Consistent with the priorities of the NIDA AIDS Research Program, this proposal will explore the social network structure in a rural drug using population in order to better understand how network factors may affect HIV risk in rural areas using an innovative multilevel approach. Results from the proposed study will inform the design and implementation of HIV interventions in rural areas and help to determine the appropriate population for which to target such activities in order to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV and other BBIs.       Although HIV remains a significant public health problem in the United States, especially among drug users, little is known about HIV risk in rural areas such as Appalachia. It has been shown in urban populations that relationships among drug users, also known as social networks, are important predictors of HIV risk. Therefore, this study seeks to characterize rural HIV risk by measuring both social network and individual behaviors in order to inform prevention activities in health resource-deprived rural areas.

"Text Messaging Adherence Assessment & Intervention Tool for Rural HIV+ Drug Users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a new application under PAS-10-098, Technology-based Adherence Interventions for Substance Abusing Populations with HIV (R34). New methods to promote HIV treatment adherence are needed for drug users, ethnic minorities, and women, who reside outside major metropolitan areas who have worse health outcomes. Familiar technological devices such as mobile phones could overcome some of the health disparities seen among rural HIV+ patients. In this project, investigators will develop and test the feasibility and promise of a text messaging system that uses Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) methods to detect nonadherence and drug use episodes, then immediately intervenes to improve HIV treatment adherence (both medication adherence and treatment engagement) in drug users living with HIV/AIDS. Using formative research with the targeted patients and partnership with a technology developer, we will develop the application and administrative system, Treatment Extension by Text (Text). Text will assess routine adherence, allow users to report critical events, and respond to randomly timed queries about adherence, drug use, and drug craving. When the Text EMA application detects threats to adherence, it will deliver a personalized, tailored intervention text message chosen by the participant. These customized messages will remind the user to take medications on time and reduce drug use. Investigators will pilot test the new adherence tool against treatment as usual over a three month period in a small pilot randomized trial to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and promise of Text. This R34 is a Stage 1b/2a project in the Stage Model of Behavioral Therapy Development in that it will develop novel interventions and methods, and generate preliminary estimates of effect sizes that will determine whether a larger, more expensive clinical trial with a longer follow-up period and evaluation of cost-effectiveness is warranted. By using technology to assess and detect episodes of nonadherence, drug use, and drug craving in real time, the project will deliver an intervention ""on the fly"" in time to help the person resume medication adherence before health damages occur. If successful, Text has the possibility of rapid scale-up for further trials across the rural U.S. to follow.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop and pilot test a text messaging system for mobile phones to assess HIV treatment adherence, quickly detect problems as they occur, and send personalized intervention messages to help rural and non-urban drug using patients achieve HIV medication adherence and interrupt drug use. This intervention could be scaled up quickly as a novel, sustainable approach to maintaining treatment adherence.

"Navigator Enhanced Case Management for Jail Inmates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year, there are over 600 unduplicated HIV-infected persons incarcerated in the San Francisco jail and almost two-thirds released with HIV-focused discharge planning were reincarcerated within 1 year. More than half of HIV-infected jail inmates are diagnosed with mental health conditions severe enough to require medication and a similar proportion report substance abuse disorders at the time of detention. While some community-based services exist, there remains a critical need exists to improve linkages to care and adherence to care plans for HIV-infected adults as they move between community and jai. An effective service delivery model used in similar high-needs populations exists, but has not been tested with HIV-infected drug users leaving jails - Navigator case management. Base on harm reduction, motivational interviewing and general social work principles, this model uses assertive community treatment and a highly proactive approach to facilitate adherence to a comprehensive care plan designed to address a client's multiple needs. Case managers work with paraprofessional peer navigators to help clients make better use of available resources, more effectively communicate with providers, sustain care over time and successfully connect with multiple service provider sectors. In this study, we propose to tailor this approach to meet the needs of HIV-infected individuals with substance abuse and mental health issues, pilot test the intervention and assessment procedures and then conduct a randomized study in which 360 HIV-infected men and women leaving jail. Specifically, participants will receive either Navigator case management delivered by the non-profit San Francisco Pre-Trial Diversion project or the standard of care currently provided to transitioning inmates, 90- days of as-needed case management provided by the San Francisco Department of Public Health's Forensic AIDS Project. We will test the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing sexual and drug-related HIV transmission risk, increasing HIV medication adherence, reducing drug dependence and reducing reincarceration. Finally, we will characterize both the Navigator and Forensic AIDS Project intervention processes and conduct exploratory analyses of the mediators of HIV transmission risk and risk reduction and HIV-related adherence among HIV+ individuals leaving jail. Our study is highly innovative because no interventions exist that are proven effective with this population - HIV-infected individuals with drug use and mental health issues. This study will also contribute to the field of HIV prevention by incorporating risk reduction counseling alongside more traditional case management support services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-infected adults incarcerated in the United States criminal justice system are predominantly active drug users and disproportionately people of color. The complex interplay of poverty, race, lack of education and sanctions--rather than treatment--for addictions reinforces returns to the criminal justice system and pervasive health disparities for HIV-infected individuals. Underlying behaviors that lead to repeated incarceration closely correlate with behaviors that are associated with HIV transmission and increased morbidity and mortality from HIV. In drug addicted adults, recidivism is driven by drug relapse and illegal activities associated with drug use, failure to engage and remain in mental health treatment or failure to break free from social instability in the form of homelessness and joblessness. This study proposes to assess whether a method of case management proven effective for similar populations can ensuring services to successfully and permanently break the cycle of incarceration, drug abuse and HIV transmission risk behavior among HIV-infected individuals leaving jail.

"Natural History of HIV Infection In Injection Drug Users     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs) represent a marginalized population with substantial disparities in health care access and outcomes. With improved survival due to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV has transformed into a chronic disease. In addition to HIV disease, IDUs also suffer from a syndemic of other chronic diseases including substance abuse, mental health disorders, and non-AIDS comorbidities. Proposed is a continuation of the ALIVE cohort study, among the largest, longest-running and productive IDU cohorts worldwide, and which has followed disadvantaged, primarily African American IDUs in Baltimore, MD since 1988. With advancing age and multimorbidity, the comprehensiveness of care will increasingly determine HIV-infected IDUs quality and quantity of life. We hypothesize that the key determinants of optimal HIV care (e.g., active drug use, provider relationships, social networks, neighborhood factors) may also determine effective comprehensive care for HIV-infected IDUs. While this cohort has and continues to be a platform for an array of studies all critical to addressing questions about the long-term course and consequences of HIV disease and its treatment among IDUs, this proposal emphasizes: 1) improved identification of HIV-infected IDUs most likely to respond optimally to ART. We will examine longitudinal trajectories of drug use and HIV RNA to define membership in optimal vs. sub-optimal response groups, and then quantitatively identify behavioral and clinical correlates and qualitatively examine barriers and coping mechanisms which underlie the ability to optimally respond. 2) To investigate the determinants and consequences of comprehensive care for HIV-infected IDUs from patient, clinical and societal perspectives. Comprehensive care for HIV-infected IDUs extends beyond HIV-focused aspects to include care for chronic comorbid diseases, substance abuse, and mental health conditions. We propose a framework that considers measures of effective comprehensive care from patient (perceived effectiveness), clinical (adherence to quality care indicators) and societal (service utilization) points of view. Building on prior investigation of individual-, provider-, and neighborhood-level factors associated with HAART effectiveness, we will identify determinants of quality comprehensive care. Extending our multi-level framework in this proposal, we will also evaluate the role of social networks (e.g. 'care-engaged' network members) on comprehensive care. Finally, we examine comprehensive care effectiveness in relation to patient-reported (quality-of-life), clinica (multimorbidity, physical performance) and societal (QALYs) outcomes.

"Brief intervention for drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV/HCV     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this study is to reduce risk behaviors and increase health and behavioral health service utilization among disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV and HCV. This project has potential to make a significant contribution to science by advancing knowledge about the health disparities, high-risk behaviors (injection drug use, sex risk), and service utilization of this high-risk, vulnerable, an understudied group of women during a time of emerging and significant public health risk in an Appalachian rural setting. This project will incorporate standardized screening (NIDA-modified ASSIST) to identify high-risk rural women drug users from jails, including injectors. Consenting women (N=350) will be asked to participate in a baseline interview, and will then be randomly assigned to one of two study groups: (1) HIV Education (HIV- Ed n=175) which includes the NIDA standard pre and post-test counseling, HIV and HCV rapid testing, and an information packet on existing community drug abuse and HIV/HCV resources; or (2) Motivational Interviewing- based HIV Risk Reduction (MI-HIV n=175) which, in addition to what is received in the HIV-Ed group, also includes an evidence-based brief intervention for high-risk women focused on an individualized plan for enhancing motivation to reduce risk behaviors and to use health and behavioral health services in the community. Specific aims include: (1) to compare the effectiveness of an evidence-based HIV risk reduction intervention (MI-HIV) to HIV Education (NIDA Standard) in reducing sex risk behaviors, injection practices, and drug use among a culturally unique sample of disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV and HCV; and (2) to examine MI-HIV Intervention engagement as a predictor of community health and behavioral health service utilization (including drug treatment and mental health) at follow-up among disadvantaged, drug- using rural women at high risk for HIV and HCV. This project is innovative because it 1) targets a high-risk and understudied group of women, 2) uses brief intervention to not only reduce risk behavior but also to enhance motivation for using community health and behavioral health resources, and 3) utilizes a real-world setting to identify high-risk women drug users. The long-term goal of this study is to increase access to health and behavioral health services in order to improve the quality of health of high-risk rural women.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall aim of this study is to reduce risk behaviors and increase health and behavioral health service utilization among disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high risk for HIV and HCV.

"Clinical and Social Implications of Cost Sharing for Cancer Drugs    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Yu-Ning Wong, a Medical Oncologist at Fox Chase Cancer Center is dedicated to a career in cancer health services research. Her goal is to develop a multidisciplinary research program to understand the impact of insurance design on cancer drug utilization and clinical outcomes. This Career Development Award will provide the means to take two important steps towards accomplishing this goal. First, it will allow for additional intensive mentored education and training in public policy research, health economics, and advanced statistical methods that will augment the candidate's previous rigorous training in epidemiology, biostatistics, and clinical medicine. Second, it will support the development of an original clinical research program using rigorous epidemiologic, econometric and survey methods to examine the impact of prescription drug insurance coverage on cancer outcomes. As new costly cancer drugs are introduced, patients with both public and private insurance are facing higher out- of-pocket costs. Cost sharing between insurers and patients (though co-payments and deductibles) has been traditionally used to control costs based on an expectation that unnecessary health care utilization will be reduced. However this expectation may result in worse socioeconomic disparities in care since some patients may be unable to afford highly effective cancer treatments. The candidate proposes three complementary studies to address the important, unanswered questions about the impact of cost sharing on cancer outcomes. Project A is a conjoint analysis-based survey to measure how patients make decisions among treatments of varying efficacy, toxicity and cost. Project B uses the results from Project A in a decision analysis model to measure the sensitivity of clinical outcomes to price and patient preferences. This will also allow us to determine if is possible to improve clinical outcomes by using low cost sharing to increase adherence to high value treatments. Project C is a natural experiment using insurance claims to measure the effect of insurance design and sociodemographic factors on the receipt of a new, expensive anti-nausea medication and subsequent outcomes. This research program will triangulate on the nexus of issues central to the understanding of cost sharing on cancer drug utilization and clinical outcomes and form the foundation for the candidate's transition to an independent investigator in cancer health services research. This project will have broad implications for the financing of high cost medical interventions because it will help policy makers, insurers and physicians understand how current models of cost sharing may contribute to socioeconomic disparities in cancer care. Our results may suggest consideration of a novel benefit design that encourages patients to make decisions based on relative value, rather than cost alone.

"Rural and Urban African American Cocaine Users' Perceived Need for Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to study the factors associated with rural/urban differences in perceived need for both drug abuse treatment and HIV testing because these are complementary services which could be integrated within formal drug abuse treatment programs or other locations to better meet the needs of African American cocaine users. We focus on perceived need among African American cocaine users because of their low rates of drug abuse treatment and HIV testing nationally as well as their demonstrated low perceived need for drug abuse treatment, high rates of risky sexual behaviors, and aversion to seeking HIV testing at local health departments in our prior research. Given that our prior natural history research did not include any urban areas, we do not know whether the low rates of drug abuse treatment and HIV testing among rural Arkansans are specific to rural residents (e.g., whether there is a disparity in access for rural African Americans) or whether urban African American cocaine users differ in other critical factors. To address these issues, we plan to conduct a community-based mixed methods study of African American cocaine users residing in rural and urban areas of Arkansas. Specifically, we propose a sequential mixed-method design, with qualitative key informant interviews conducted first (30 rural, 30 urban), followed by larger-scale, structured interviews (200 rural, 200 urban) using standardized instruments, pertinent measures from our prior rural health services and HIV research, and newly developed questions based on our initial qualitative work. Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS), a variant of snowball sampling, will be used to identify and recruit participants. The primary aims of the study are: 1) Using qualitative methods, to describe rural/urban differences in pathways to drug use and drug use cultures, perceptions of access to drug abuse treatment and HIV testing, awareness and perceptions of what constitutes drug abuse treatment and HIV testing, and preferences for formal or informal drug abuse treatment and the site or location of HIV testing; 2) Using quantitative and qualitative methods, to compare and contrast rural and urban cocaine users' perceived need for drug abuse treatment and HIV testing and key predisposing, enabling, health, and other factors which could impede or facilitate perceived need; and 3) Using quantitative methods, to investigate whether rural/urban differences in perceived need for drug abuse treatment and HIV testing are mediated by key predisposing, enabling, and health factors as well as treatment and testing awareness and preferences. The knowledge gained from this project will enable health policy makers, treatment program managers, and providers to make more informed decisions about how to encourage and facilitate the utilization of drug abuse treatment and HIV testing among African American cocaine users in the Southern U.S., an underserved and high risk population.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Of public health concern are the low rates of drug abuse treatment and high rates of HIV among African American cocaine users, especially in the Southern U.S. The knowledge gained from the proposed research would enable managers of public and behavioral health systems to make more informed decisions about how to target and tailor culturally sensitive messages aimed at increasing awareness of the benefits of drug abuse treatment and HIV testing. The proposed research would also provide new insight into whether HIV testing should be integrated within drug abuse treatment facilities to better meet the needs of rural as well as urban African American cocaine users.

"Research Training in the Prevention of Drug Abuse & AIDS in Communities of Color This revised application for a MIDARP program at Howard University describes the Research Training  Program in Drug Abuse and AIDS Prevention in Communities of Color which is designed to increase the  capacity of faculty and students at Howard to conduct rigorous and competitive research in the prevention of  drug abuse and HIV/AIDS in communities of color. The program will emphasize training in transdisciplinary  research on relationships between environmental stress, biological responses, risk behaviors and health  outcomes and will utilize collaborations with senior investigators in research intensive universities to mentor  Howard faculty investigators. The MIDARP will also work closely with existing programs that link Howard  faculty and students to research training opportunities to (1) increase knowledge and interest in drug abuse  and AIDS prevention research among faculty and students in these programs and (2) utilize the resources of  these programs to expand the range of training opportunities available to MIDARP investigators and  students. Howard students will be introduced to drug abuse and AIDS prevention research and career  development by augmenting existing drug abuse courses in the College of Arts and Sciences and the  curriculum for medical, basic science, nursing, and pharmacy students to include information on drug abuse  and AIDS prevention research.. We will also fund a pre-doctoral dissertation stipend and recruit students to  serve as research assistants in the MIDARP pilot studies. The unique strengths of the program include the  opportunity to (1) integrate education regarding drug abuse and AIDS prevention research into existing  research training programs for faculty and students;(2) train individuals in diverse disciplines such as the  health professions and sciences (i.e., medicine, basic sciences, pharmacy, nursing) who are less likely to  pursue research careers in drug abuse and AIDS prevention research; and (3) support transdisciplinary  research in drug use and AIDS prevention based on strong existing University research programs in  genetics, physiology, and psychobiology. A transdisciplinary approach will be reflected in the MIDARP  leadership that includes a Director who is a behavioral scientist specializing in research on environmental  stress, drug use, and AIDS risk in communities of color and a Deputy Director who is an immunogeneticist  with expertise in microbiology, and founding Director of the Human Genome Project at Howard University.

"Familias Unidas Stage III Study: Preventing Substance Abuse in Hispanic Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study's overarching goal is to reduce the ethnic disparities in illicit drug use, cigarette use, and HIV between Hispanic and non-Hispanic youth. This goal will be accomplished by four aims: AIM 1 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Practice (i.e., standard prevention services), in preventing illicit drug use; AIM 2 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Control, in preventing cigarette use; AIM 3 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Control, in preventing unprotected sexual behavior; and AIM 4 is to assess the extent to which family functioning mediates the effects of the intervention on illicit drug use, cigarette use, and unprotected sexual behavior. Twenty four middle schools with a total sample of 744 Hispanic adolescents from a wide geographic area of Miami-Dade County will be randomized using a block design to one of two conditions: Familias Unidas or Community Practice. The Familias Unidas intervention has been evaluated and found to be efficacious in two separate randomized controlled trials. In the first study (Pantin et al., 2003), Familias Unidas was shown to be efficacious relative to a no intervention control condition in increasing family functioning and reducing behavior problems (Prado et al., 2006), risk factors for youth illicit drug use and unprotected sex. In the second randomized controlled trial (Prado et al., in press), Familias Unidas was found to be efficacious, relative to two attention control conditions, in preventing cigarette use and illicit drug use. Familias Unidas was also found to be efficacious relative to both of the control conditions in preventing/reducing unprotected sexual behavior at last sexual intercourse. Finally, family functioning was found to mediate the effects of intervention condition on the outcomes. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) will be used to test: (H1) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing illicit drug use over time; (H2) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing cigarette use over time; and (H3) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing unprotected sexual behavior over time. Additionally HLM will be used to determine whether (H1a) the effect of Familias Unidas on illicit drug use will be partially mediated by family functioning; (H2a) the effect of Familias Unidas on cigarette use will be partially mediated by family functioning and (H3a) the effect of Familias Unidas on unprotected sexual behavior will be partially mediated by family functioning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of the proposed study is to reduce illicit drug use, cigarette use, and unsafe sexual behavior health disparities in Hispanic populations. The knowledge expected to be gained from this study will aid in the development of effective interventions to reduce drug use, cigarette use, unprotected sexual behavior, and HIV in Hispanic adolescents.

"African American Female Drug Users: HIV, Health Disparities, & Criminality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this study is to understand how drug use and criminality are related to health disparities, particularly HIV, and service utilization among African American drug using and non-drug using women across criminal justice status. While drug use is similar across racial groups in the US, African Americans are disproportionately more likely to experience severe health consequences and criminal involvement as a result of drug misuse. Adequate health care may not be received by African American female offenders because they experience the burden of their race, class, gender, and criminal offender status. There is limited scientific data to help understand the linkages between health disparities such as HIV, untreated drug abuse, barriers to service utilization, and status as a criminal offender among African American females. This study is significant because of its potential to identify differences in health disparities and service utilization among African American drug using and non-drug using women in selected levels of criminal justice status (intensive correctional supervision-prison (n=200), moderate correctional supervision-jail (n=200), community supervision-probation (n=200), and no criminal justice involvement (n=200)). All 800 African American females will be followed longitudinally for three 6-month intervals to examine health status and the use of health services across time. The specific aims are: (1) To describe the prevalence of health problems among African American women across criminal justice status and drug use status; (2) To determine the cultural, predisposing, historical health, and potential enabling factors that are predictors of health problems among African American drug using and non-drug using women across criminal justice status over 18 months; (3) To describe the prevalence of untreated health problems, the patterns of health services utilization, and the cultural barriers to service utilization among African American women across criminal justice status and drug use status; and (4) To examine the factors that predict the likelihood of using health services among African American drug using and non-drug using women across criminal justice status over 18 months. The significance of this study includes the potential to provide criminal justice systems-level data for health planning and health policy for prevention, intervention, and treatment of African American female drug users.       This study is significant to the public health field because of its potential to understand the severity of health disparities among African American women across criminal justice status and drug use status and to predict health status and the use of health services over time. This knowledge of African American females can be used as a foundation for future criminal justice systems-level interventions to increase the use of preventative health care and subsequently reduce the need for expensive medical services, as well as to decrease HIV risk behaviors including drug use, unprotected sex, and recidivism.

"Factors for enhanced neurotoxicity in methamphetamine abuse in HIV infection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted in response to PAR-09-011 Diversity-promoting Institutions Drug Abuse Research Program (DIDARP) requested by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). This proposed research program is timely since it focuses on two ofthe major health disparity issues in Hawaii, namely, methamphetamine abuse and HIV infection. Recent surveys indicate that Native Hawaiians or other Pacific islanders have the highest rate of methamphetamine use among persons aged 12 or older in the United States. Although HIV/AIDS infection rate is relatively low in Hawaii compared to other major metropolis, the rates are increasing among Hawaiians. This DIDARP will include two primary and one pilot research projects that will focus on mechanisms and factors that might enhance neurotoxicity associated with methamphetamine of HIV. We aim to enhance the capacity for drug abuse research at UH by creating this small translational research team. This group will take advantage and build on the expertise of the few but outstanding existing clinical drug abuse and HIV researchers and basic scientists. We aim to enable UH to develop a strong clinical and translational drug abuse research program. To complement these projects, we additionally propose training and career development activities that wil offer exciting opportunities for DIDARP investigators and others at UH through the Administrative and Training Core. The Faculty in the Core will provide guidance and mentorship for these junior faculty and graduate students, through infrastructure support, educational courses, seminars, and a dedicated DIDARP website, We have obtained institutional support for two additional graduate students for the program. We also have recruited 4 distinguished External Advisory Committee members with expertise related to the proposed research; each has enthusiastically agreed to provide their advice and letter of support for the development of this DIDARP at UH. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (See instructions); The current proposal attempts to strengthen drug abuse and HIV research capacity by developing translational research teams at the University of Hawaii, and to train junior investigators and students in drug abuse and HIV research.

"Collaborative Research on Drug Abuse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This P01 develops and applies state-of-the-art methods to analyze existing but under-utilized drug abuse databases in collaboration with their owners. We address contemporary, theoretical, and applied issues in drug abuse research to understand intersections between substance abuse and AIDS risk behaviors as well as minority and gender-based health disparities. We work with dozens of investigators from drug & social policy, epidemiology, health sciences, medicine, nursing, psychiatry, psychology, public health, and social work who own exciting substance abuse data to develop models that test current theories, especially on epidemiology, prevention, intervention, and treatment of drug abuse, using modern multivariate methods to control for measurement errors, biases, and other confounds. The Models and Methods Project develops psychometric and statistical analytic techniques that hold special promise for improving the quality of drug abuse and AIDS research. The At-Risk Project studies substance abuse related data sets on vulnerable populations (substance abusers, homeless people, individuals who are HIV positive or who have AIDS, victims of domestic abuse, runaways, gang members, and others at high risk for AIDS or drug abuse) with methods to control sampling, measurement, distributional and other biases. The Community Project studies drug abuse etiology, adult consequences, HIV risk, intergenerational processes, general deviance, and related issues in large community-based samples, and develops and tests explanatory theories using models that permit separation of common from specific effects, control for artifacts, etc. The Core Project oversees and integrates all components, hosts visiting scholars, provides computer facilities, and sponsors a mentoring program for disadvantaged students. The substantive part of the Models Project and the At-Risk and Community Projects will be developing and testing integrative theories that can be applied across different populations. The findings from their studies will lead to greater understanding of precursors and concomitants of substance abuse and HIV/AIDS risk and transmission. In turn, these findings will guide development of effective interventions to reduce negative health outcomes and treatment disparities in community, ethnic, and vulnerable populations, and provide guidance on how these may be alleviated.     ",Collaborative Research on Drug Abuse,8539138,P01DA001070,[''],NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P01,2012,153998,0.06373110537308126
"Drug Abuse, Incarceration & Health Disparities in HIV/AIDS: A Longitudinal Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to address how disproportionate confinement of racial/ethnic minorities-especially African Americans-affects health disparities in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. African Americans comprise only 13% of the general population, but about 40% of incarcerated youth and adults and 50% of new cases of HIV/AIDS. Yet, large multisite national longitudinal studies of HIV/AIDS focus on high- risk samples such as men who have sex with men (MACS), women infected with HIV and other ""at-risk"" females (WIHS), and infected women and their infants (WITS). These studies do not include adolescents, do not sample correctional populations, and do not examine the effect of incarceration on HIV/AIDS. Most studies of incarcerated populations are cross-sectional and provide limited information on the effects of incarceration. To continue to address this key omission in the literature, we propose to extend the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a longitudinal study of 1829 juvenile justice youth, enrolled at age 10-18 years (1172 males, 657 females; 1005 African Americans, 296 non-Hispanic whites, 524 Hispanics, and 4 ""other"" race/ethnicity). Currently, the HIV/AIDS component of the project (RO1 DA022953) includes only a subsample (n=743) and 10-, 11-, 12-, and 13-year follow-up interviews. We now propose to (1) study the entire sample (originally 1829, now 1678); (2) conduct 3 additional annual interviews (14-, 15-, and 16-year follow-ups), at which time participants will be aged 26-34 years; (3) collect official records to cross-validate self-reported data (on STI status, arrests, incarceration history, and services received); (4) test the entire sample for HIV infection, chlamydia, and gonorrhea; and (5) administer a new module on incarceration, release, and re-entry. Participants are re-interviewed whether they are re-incarcerated or back in the community. Using data collected in prior phases and the additional interviews, we will examine patterns of drug use, drug use disorder, HIV/AIDS risk and infection from adolescence (ages 10-17 years) to emerging adulthood (ages 18-24 years) and young adulthood (age 25 and older). Our Specific Aims focus on how incarceration, release, and re-entry (e.g., age[s] incarcerated, number of incarcerations, length of incarcerations, amount of time spent in the community between incarcerations) affect the following: (1) drug use behaviors (including the number and types of substances used, frequency of use, and route of administration) and drug use disorders (onset, persistence, desistance, and recurrence); (2) HIV/AIDS sex risk behaviors (including unprotected anal or vaginal receptive sex and trading sex for drugs) and injection-risk behaviors; (3) prevalence and incidence of HIV infection and other STIs; (4) the relationship between patterns of drug use and disorder and HIV/AIDS risk behaviors, especially how risk and protective factors predict, moderate, and mediate these relationships. This study responds to the initiatives of NIDA, NIAAA, and other NIH institutes to reduce health disparities in HIV/AIDS in minority populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial/ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately from the HIV/AIDS epidemic and are disproportionately incarcerated. To address health disparities in HIV/AIDS, we must study correctional populations, which increased from nearly 1.8 million in 1997 to over 2.2 million by mid-year 2006. The proposed study will guide public health policy by investigating how incarceration affects the development of substance use and disorder and HIV/AIDS; identifying risk and protective factors that are potentially malleable; identifying points of intervention during key developmental periods; and extending current conceptual models to include incarceration, release, and reentry.","Drug Abuse,

"Drug Policy, Incarceration, Community Re-entry, and Race Disparities in HIV/AIDS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a revision of an application submitted last year in response to PAR-07-379, ""Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Disparities."" We will analyze the interconnections between coercive mobility (the massive migration between the criminal justice [CJ] system and the community) produced by US drug policies and race disparities in HIV-related sexual risk among a sample of drug offenders in Connecticut (CT). Further, we will examine whether the association between coercive mobility (CM) and HIV-related sexual risk is affected by the degree of social disorganization in the communities in which these offenders reside. We also will study the feasibility of recruiting and following sexual partners of these individuals to better understand the impacts of CM on partners' HIV-related risk. We hypothesize that CM produces race disparities in HIV risk in a number of distinct ways: 1) Blacks are more likely than Whites to be incarcerated, so HIV-related sexual risk associated with CM can produce race disparities in HIV risk even if the effects of CM are the same for both Blacks and Whites; 2) Blacks are more likely than Whites to reside in communities experiencing the disorganizing impacts of CM, so to the extent that social disorganization exacerbates the effects of CM, it will affect the HIV risks of Blacks to a greater degree than Whites; 3) The sexual partners of Blacks are more likely to come from these same socially disorganized communities, furthering the negative impacts of CM for both returning inmates and their partners, and contributing to race disparities in HIV risk among women; and 4) Blacks are more likely to be penalized by drug policies in ways that increase their movement between prison/jail and the community and their vulnerability to its associated harms. We also hypothesize that we will be able to recruit and retain the sexual partners of study participants and conduct exploratory analyses of the impact of CM on their HIV-related sexual risk.

"Substance Use and Risky Sex in Highly Vulnerable Populations The proposed project will help me develop the skills and expertise necessary to establish an independent research career focused on the role of substance use in sexual risk-taking behavior and associated adverse reproductive outcomes, especially sexually transmitted infections (STIs). To achieve this goal, I will supplement my graduate training as a developmental psychologist and post-doctoral training in epidemiology with training in sexual risk behavior in vulnerable populations, health disparities associated with race, and career development in longitudinal research methodology. Complementary to these training activities, I propose: 1) secondary data analyses of sexual risk behavior and outcomes using data from an ongoing longitudinal study of the offspring of teenage mothers and a study of women with and without borderline personality disorder (BPD); 2) collection of new data on the offspring of teenage mothers during a 16-year assessment and; 3) a new pilot study of common STIs in this sample (offspring of teenage mothers). The proposed research will form the basis for an ROI application in the third year of the award period. My short term goals are to (1) increase knowledge about risk for STIs, including behavioral dysregulation that may underlie risky sex and risk factors associated with risky sex and associated outcomes, (2) learn new methods of measuring risk behavior and adverse reproductive outcomes, including clinical tests for STIs and event-level assessments, (3) learn more about health disparities associated with race, and (4) develop the research skills that will enable me to become an independent investigator and obtain NIH funding to support my research, specifically longitudinal data analyses. My long-term career goal is to understand the ecological setting for drug use and sexual risk behaviors in vulnerable populations, and how drug use may contribute to significantly higher rates of unintended pregnancies and STIs in African-American youth. The proposed career development training will take place at the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. This department provides an outstanding environment for interdisciplinary training by highly collaborative faculty who are leading experts in their chosen fields. RELEVANCE (See Instructions): The proposed research will help identify behavioral risk factors for sexually transmitted infections that are implicated in higher rates of HIV, especially among African-Americans. The results can be used to develop prevention programs aimed at reducing drug use and sexually transmitted infections among vulnerable adolescents and within psychiatric populations.

"Drug Use Among Hispanic Emerging Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among Hispanic adolescents, cultural factors such as acculturation, perceived discrimination, and acculturative stress are risk factors for drug use. Previous studies suggest that the effects of acculturation on drug use may be mediated by family functioning; when adolescents acculturate more rapidly than their parents, the parent- child acculturation discrepancy can lead to breakdowns in family communication and cohesion and increases in family conflict, which in turn can lead to risky behaviors such as drug use among the adolescents. Although there is considerable information about the role of family acculturation patterns in drug use among Hispanic adolescents, we do not know how family acculturation patterns affect adolescents as they transition into the next stage of life, emerging adulthood. Emerging adulthood, a provisional stage in which young adults try out adult roles but may not become firmly entrenched in them, is characterized by identity exploration, residential instability, self-focus, a subjective feeling of being between adolescence and true adulthood, and increased opportunities. In general, individuals who navigate this transition smoothly emerge with a more developed sense of identity, successful interpersonal relationships, new life roles, and minimal levels of substance use. However, the high level of independence and low level of social constraints that occur during emerging adulthood also make this a high-risk period for drug use and other problem behaviors. Understanding how factors in adolescence affect drug use in early adulthood can lead to better intervention efforts for adolescents. More research is needed to determine how cultural factors influence the transition to emerging adulthood among Hispanics and to identify the risk factors for escalation of drug use during this pivotal transition. This continuation application proposes to follow an established cohort of Hispanic adolescents (12th graders in the 2008-2009 school year) for an additional 4 years to identify the predictors of their drug use trajectories during the transition to emerging adulthood. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are the following: (1) Conduct an additional 4 annual surveys of the participants; (2) Construct individual growth curves to describe their use of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs; (3) Identify the predictors of the growth curve parameters, including cultural factors, peer factors, substance use during high school, psychological factors, and demographic factors; (4) Evaluate emerging adulthood variables as potential mediators of these influences, including identity exploration, experimentation / possibilities, instability (residential mobility, role transitions), self-focus, and subjective experience of being in-between adolescence and adulthood; and (5) Make recommendations for the development of improved health education messages to prevent drug use among acculturating Hispanics during the transition to emerging adulthood. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application addresses the public health goals of preventing and reducing substance use among young adults. It also aims to reduce health disparities by identifying risk and protective factors that are specific to Hispanics.

"Modifiable Disparities in Treatment for Rheumatoid Arthritis  Project Summary. Disparities exist in all aspects of health care and have profound effects on health and the utilization of health services, including medications. Reducing disparities requires a detailed understanding of these causes. While disparities in many chronic conditions have been explored, little work has focused on rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most common systemic rheumatic disease which is associated with increased mortality, disability and nearly 20 billion dollars in annual medical care costs in the US. RA drug treatment can substantially reduce pain and disability, and recommendations include disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for all patients. Several community-based studies document that only 30-60% of patients with RA receive DMARDs and that older age, black race and lower socioeconomic status all associate with under-use of DMARDs. Without a better understanding of these disparities, interventions are substantially hindered. The first aim of this research will examine geographic, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in RA treatment in nationally representative samples. We will use large representative national surveys with linked health care claims and/or geocoded Census information to gain a clearer picture of regional disparities in DMARD use, to determine whether both individual level and neighborhood level socioeconomic factors as well as and race and ethnicity play a role, and to identify how access to care affects prescribing. This information will allow us to assess how much of the variation in DMARD use can be explained by modifiable factors. The second aim will determine whether positive and negative changes in drug insurance status relate to changes in DMARD use for RA. Research supports the contention that gains and losses in insurance affect the use of all aspects of health services. We will analyze the new Medicare Part D drug coverage as well as information from younger patients enrolled in a longitudinal cohort of RA patients with over twenty years of data to assess how drug insurance affects access to DMARDs for RA. The third aim will identify ecologic and health system factors associated with disparities in the use of DMARDs for RA. Economically vulnerable neighborhoods, such as those with low rates of English as a primary language or low home ownership rates, and greater distance to rheumatologists and hospitals may all negatively impact disparities in RA care. We will work with linked utilization and geocoded data for enrollees with RA from several statewide health care insurance plans. In the final aim, we will survey patients to determine the attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge that contribute to disparities in DMARD use for RA. Neither the prior aims nor previous studies have incorporated information about patient's attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge into models of RA treatment disparities. We will purposefully sample patients with RA who do and do not receive DMARDs to determine whether they have been offered DMARDs in the past, their understanding of risks and benefits from these agents, and the usual sources of information they consult for making treatment decisions.  Project Narrative. The data collected in these four aims will answer key questions about disparities in RA care. As well, by focusing on potentially modifiable risk factors, the information collected will point directly toward strategies for reducing disparities in DMARD use.",Modifiable Disparities in Treatment for Rheumatoid Arthritis,8298604,R01AR056215,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Antirheumatic Drugs ', ' Anti-Rheumatic Drugs ', ' Anti-Rheumatic Agents ', ' Antirheumatic Agents ', ' Inflammatory Arthritis ', ' Atrophic Arthritis ', ' Rheumatoid Arthritis ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Attitude ', ' Belief ', ' Black race ', ' Blue Cross ', ' Blue Shield ', ' Censuses ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Data Sources ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' immunosuppressive ', ' Immunosuppressants ', ' Immunosuppressive Agents ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Infant ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Language ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Ownership ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', "" Physician's Role "", ' Play ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Research Support ', ' Rheumatic Diseases ', ' Musculoskeletal Pain Disorder ', ' Rheumatism ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Drug Insurance ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Ecological Systems ', ' Ecologic Systems ', ' Ecosystem ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Inequality ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs ', ' DMARDs ', ' DMARD ', ' Disease-Modifying Second-Line Drugs ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Consult ', ' cohort ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' beneficiary ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' modifiable risk ', ' patient population ', ' rheumatologist ', ' ']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2012,583444,0.023357130072414658
"Targeting HIV Risk Behaviors in Juvenile Drug Court-Involved Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overriding purpose of this study is to develop and test an intervention for reducing substance use and risky sexual behaviors among youth involved in juvenile drug court. Juvenile drug court provides an excellent setting in which to pursue the key study objectives by providing access to a well identified high risk population. Second, in addition to frequent judicial oversight, juvenile drug courts include several features that can enhance intervention effectiveness, sustainability, and potential for adoption. In addition, the fact that all juvenile drug courts have community-based treatment components and that such courts have been disseminated nationwide suggests the possibility of eventual widespread adoption if the proposed intervention is effective. The proposed intervention integrates evidence-based protocols for contingency management (CM) for substance abusing youth and family engagement strategies, with an evidence-informed family systems intervention for sexual risk originally developed to address substance use and sexual risk behaviors in HIV+ youth. These three interventions will be integrated into an efficient intervention that, if effective, can be amenable to adoption by juvenile drug courts. Following protocol development and beta testing, 160 drug court youth and their families will be randomized to the experimental intervention condition (HIV Risk Reduction or ""HRR"") versus Drug Court with Community Services (DC) conditions. Key outcomes will be assessed through 12-months post-baseline using a multi-method approach that will include assessment of substance use, risky sexual behaviors, criminal behavior, and participation in HIV counseling and testing services. Specific aims include: 1: Adapt existing intervention and training protocols into a single, efficient HRR intervention, beta test this HHR protocol with four youth in juvenile drug court and their families, and revise treatment and research protocols accordingly; 2: Conduct a randomized trial with 160 youth in juvenile drug court and their families to examine youth-level intervention effects (i.e., on substance use, sexual risk behavior, HIV counseling and testing, delinquent behavior) in comparison to DC through 12- months post referral and assess intervention fidelity. 3. If results suggest a positive HRR treatment effect, revise the intervention and training protocols in preparation for an effectiveness study and extended follow-up study. Importantly, the proposed study will (1) consider the multiple levels of influence on juvenile drug use, criminal justice involvement, and HIV risk behaviors, (2) integrate a drug abuse and HIV prevention intervention for youth in the criminal justice system with drug-related offenses, (3) address health disparities by targeting a primarily minority population of youth, and (4) increase referrals to HIV testing and counseling of drug court-involved youth. This study is designed to reduce HIV risk by addressing the potent interaction of drug use and risky sexual behaviors in drug court youth with evidence-based treatment components to maximize the likelihood of reversing these youths' adverse behavioral trajectories.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study is designed to gain knowledge about effective interventions for reducing HIV risk in a high risk population. Reducing HIV risk by effectively targeting substance use and risky sexual behaviors and by locating even a small number of HIV-positive youth could favorably impact society at multiple levels (individual, family, peer, community, fiscal).

"Community Vulnerability and Responses to Drug-User-Related HIV/AIDS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing continuation application for the Community Vulnerability and Responses to Drug-User- Related HIV/AIDS study of why large US metropolitan areas vary over time in their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS among drug users and in their responses-i.e., in policies and programs that may affect the epidemic. Drug use and HIV epidemics change over time. In the last funding period, we showed that HIV prevalence in the 96 largest US metropolitan areas declined among injection drug users (IDUs) from 1992 to 2002, and that the population prevalence of IDUs declined in these areas from 1992 to 2000, but then began to rise again. We also showed that metropolitan areas varied in these trajectories, and that a variety of social and policy forces shaped IDU prevalence, racial disparities in IDU prevalence, HIV prevalence among IDUs, racial disparities in AIDS prevalence among IDUs, drug abuse treatment coverage, and syringe exchange access and coverage. Ominously, our recent analyses indicate that the prevalence of IDUs among youth (aged 15 - 29) has begun to rise. Further, as others have shown, HIV has spread widely among NIDUs (non-injecting users of heroin, cocaine, crack, amphetamines or methamphetamine) in some metropolitan areas. These changes are occurring against the backdrop of an economy that has recently shifted from slow to rapid decline, a shift that will lead to great difficulty in maintaining, let alone expanding, services for drug users. Therefore, the Specific Aims of this proposed continuation are: 1. To describe trends, in the 96 largest US metropolitan areas from 1992 - 2012, in (a) critical epidemiologic outcomes (population prevalence of IDUs and NIDUs, and particularly their prevalence among youth; and, among IDUs, HIV prevalence, late-diagnosis HIV cases, and AIDS incidence and mortality) as well as in (b) the implementation of evidence-based drug- related interventions (drug abuse treatment, syringe exchange, HIV counseling and testing) and (c) non- evidence-based drug-related interventions (incarceration and arrests of drug users). 2. To understand how macro-social contexts (e.g., economic changes, social integration, racial residential segregation) and epidemiologic need affect interventions; how interventions and macro-social contexts together affect epidemiologic contexts; how some interventions (e.g., arrests, incarceration) affect others (e.g., syringe exchange coverage); and how some epidemiologic outcomes (e.g., prevalence of young IDUs) affect others (e.g., HIV prevalence). 3. To develop an integrated theory, using agent based modeling, of how these processes interact and thus what the impacts of various intervention mixes are likely to be in given social contexts. 4. To disseminate estimates, results and theoretical understandings to public health agencies and continue to advise them on how they might respond.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will estimate changes in injection and non-injection drug use, in HIV, AIDS and AIDS mortality rates among injection drug users, and in drug- and HIV-related interventions among drug users, in 96 large metropolitan areas over a 21-year period (1992 - 2012). We will investigate how these epidemics and interventions affect one another, and how macro-contextual factors like economic and social conditions shape them both. We will identify metropolitan areas in which serious drug use, HIV or AIDS epidemics are emerging, and offer state and local health departments and drug agencies the best information available on policies and programs that might reduce these epidemics. Our findings will also help national public health agencies, including the CDC and SAMHSA, and other researchers, plan a mixture of evidence-based programs and policies to reduce the forces that lead to high-risk drug use and the associated HIV and AIDS epidemics.

"Economic Evaluation of Drug Abuse Treatment and HIV Prevention Services for Pregn DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Economic evaluation of drug abuse treatment and HIV prevention services for pregnant women is critical to identify the most efficient and equitable use of scarce resources. Economic and policy research on the efficiency of drug abuse treatment and HIV prevention services among vulnerable populations such as women, adolescents and members of minority groups is necessary to improve drug abuse and HIV/AIDS services for these vulnerable and underserved populations. While work in this area continues to grow, there is still a dearth of rigorous economic evaluations of such programs, especially those that adhere to quality standards as recommended by the U.S. Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. The overall objective of this study is to conduct the first economic evaluation of an innovative behavioral approach integrating Motivational Enhancement Therapy with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET-CBT) as compared to standard Brief Advice (BA) within prenatal care to decrease use of a full range of substances (e.g., marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines, alcohol, nicotine), to reduce HIV risk behavior and to achieve better infant health outcomes (e.g. longer gestations, greater birth weight, reduced medical consequences such as admission and length of stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)). The specific aims of this study are: (1) to conduct cost analyses of the MET-CBT and BA intervention arms; (2) to conduct incremental cost-effectiveness analyses of the two interventions (MET-CBT and BA), vis-`-vis each other, in terms of substance use, infant health outcomes and HIV risk reduction; and (3) to conduct incremental cost-utility analyses determining the net cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) saved respectively by each intervention arm (MET-CBT and BA), vis-`-vis each other, in terms of substance use and HIV risk reduction. The proposed research is responsive to PA-07-122 in that it proposes to conduct research related to cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses, services costs, methodological research, and the cross-cutting themes of HIV/AIDS and health disparities. The proposed research is grounded in sound microeconomic principles and standardized techniques as reported in the U.S. Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine, and proposes rigorous conceptual and methodological research to improve the evidence base on the unit costs and cost-effectiveness of substance abuse treatment and HIV prevention services. It builds on a NIDA-funded randomized controlled trial (R01-DA019135) of an innovate behavioral approach, which offers a new paradigm of treatment services, integrating MET-CBT within prenatal care compared to standard BA, and offering promise to improve access to and strengthen substance use treatment and HIV prevention services targeted at drug using pregnant women who are highly susceptible to HIV/AIDS.        PROJECT NARRATIVE Drug abuse and high risk HIV behavior during pregnancy are major public health problems in the United States due to their impact on individual users, their offspring, and surrounding communities. Drug abuse and HIV prevention programs targeting pregnant women have the potential to be cost-effective due to the resultant fewer low-birth-weight babies and perinatal deaths, fewer physical, cognitive and behavioral problems during infancy and childhood, and the significant health benefits that can accrue to the mother. The overall objective of this study is to conduct the first economic evaluation of an innovative behavioral approach integrating Motivational Enhancement Therapy with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MET-CBT) as compared to standard Brief Advice (BA) within prenatal care to decrease use of a full range of substances (e.g., marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines, alcohol, nicotine), to reduce HIV risk behavior and to achieve better infant health outcomes (e.g. longer gestations, greater birth weight, reduced medical consequences such as admission and length of stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)).",Economic Evaluation of Drug Abuse Treatment and HIV Prevention Services for Pregn,8787848,R01DA025555,[''],NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2012,663385,0.012176497278779718
"Rural and Urban African American Cocaine Users' Perceived Need for Care    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We seek to study the factors associated with rural/urban differences in perceived need for both drug abuse treatment and HIV testing because these are complementary services which could be integrated within formal drug abuse treatment programs or other locations to better meet the needs of African American cocaine users. We focus on perceived need among African American cocaine users because of their low rates of drug abuse treatment and HIV testing nationally as well as their demonstrated low perceived need for drug abuse treatment, high rates of risky sexual behaviors, and aversion to seeking HIV testing at local health departments in our prior research. Given that our prior natural history research did not include any urban areas, we do not know whether the low rates of drug abuse treatment and HIV testing among rural Arkansans are specific to rural residents (e.g., whether there is a disparity in access for rural African Americans) or whether urban African American cocaine users differ in other critical factors. To address these issues, we plan to conduct a community-based mixed methods study of African American cocaine users residing in rural and urban areas of Arkansas. Specifically, we propose a sequential mixed-method design, with qualitative key informant interviews conducted first (30 rural, 30 urban), followed by larger-scale, structured interviews (200 rural, 200 urban) using standardized instruments, pertinent measures from our prior rural health services and HIV research, and newly developed questions based on our initial qualitative work. Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS), a variant of snowball sampling, will be used to identify and recruit participants. The primary aims of the study are: 1) Using qualitative methods, to describe rural/urban differences in pathways to drug use and drug use cultures, perceptions of access to drug abuse treatment and HIV testing, awareness and perceptions of what constitutes drug abuse treatment and HIV testing, and preferences for formal or informal drug abuse treatment and the site or location of HIV testing; 2) Using quantitative and qualitative methods, to compare and contrast rural and urban cocaine users' perceived need for drug abuse treatment and HIV testing and key predisposing, enabling, health, and other factors which could impede or facilitate perceived need; and 3) Using quantitative methods, to investigate whether rural/urban differences in perceived need for drug abuse treatment and HIV testing are mediated by key predisposing, enabling, and health factors as well as treatment and testing awareness and preferences. The knowledge gained from this project will enable health policy makers, treatment program managers, and providers to make more informed decisions about how to encourage and facilitate the utilization of drug abuse treatment and HIV testing among African American cocaine users in the Southern U.S., an underserved and high risk population.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Of public health concern are the low rates of drug abuse treatment and high rates of HIV among African American cocaine users, especially in the Southern U.S. The knowledge gained from the proposed research would enable managers of public and behavioral health systems to make more informed decisions about how to target and tailor culturally sensitive messages aimed at increasing awareness of the benefits of drug abuse treatment and HIV testing. The proposed research would also provide new insight into whether HIV testing should be integrated within drug abuse treatment facilities to better meet the needs of rural as well as urban African American cocaine users.

"Developmental Pathways to Substance Use Across European & Asian American Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As one of the fastest growing ethnic minority groups in the United States, alcohol and drug use in American Americans has increasingly been recognized as a public health problem. Emerging research has documented biological, psychosocial, and cultural factors that are associated with alcohol use in Asian American youth adults (Hendershot et al., 2005). However, existing studies have neither adopted a developmental perspective to study the emergence of alcohol use and problems in Asian American during late adolescence, nor have they tested whether prior findings can be generalized to predict drug use and problems. Concurrently, evidence from a separate line of research has suggested that effects of parenting are often different across Asian and European American youth. Numerous studies, for example, have suggested that authoritarian parenting style has beneficial effects in Asian American youth, but detrimental effects in European American youth on outcomes such as academic performance and socio-emotional competence. Subsequent research has indicated that parental constructs such as emotional support and psychological control may also have differential effects across Asian and European American youth (e.g., Chao & Tseng, 2002). Despite these findings, no published study has documented differential effects of parenting on alcohol and drug use across Asian and European American youth. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to examine moderation effects by ethnicity on the association between parenting and alcohol and drug use outcomes in a longitudinal sample of Asian and European American youth. Specifically, the proposed study will test whether parental emotional support, psychological control and monitoring have differential effects on alcohol and drug use outcomes across Asian and European American youth. Data will be drawn from 97 Asian American and 255 European American youth who participated in the Developmental Pathway Project. Structural equation modeling and factor analysis techniques will be used to test (1) whether parental emotional support, psychological control, and monitoring in 7th grade will differentially predict alcohol and drug use outcomes in 9th and 12th grade across Asian and European American youth; (2) whether developmental pathways from parenting to alcohol and drug use outcomes (via school achievement and peer substance use in 8th grade) are different across Asian and European American youth; and (3) whether the hypothesized moderation effects by ethnicity can be attributed to different interpretation of parenting, as suggested by prior research (e.g., Chao & Aque, 2009). Results from the proposed study can be used to guide the development of culturally sensitive prevention and intervention programs for alcohol and drug use in Asian American youth.       The proposed project addresses a strategic goal of the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) on the prevention of alcohol and drug use through understanding risk and protective factors in adolescence, a developmental stage during which substance use increases over time. This project also addresses NIDA's cross-cutting priorities of decreasing health disparity related to drug addiction and training new investigators from a diverse (including minority) background.

"HIV - Emergence of Drug Resistance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is to renew a project focused on using mathematical models to understand and predict the emergence of drug resistance to antiretrovirals (ARVs) for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). As the usage rate of ARVs in resource-poor regions is increasing, high levels of drug resistance potentially could emerge and have a devastating impact on public health worldwide, derailing global plans to provide this treatment to many millions of HIV-infected individuals. Our proposed projects will extend the work of the current award, which showed the value of using mathematical models to understand the temporal dynamics of drug-resistant strains of HIV in the United States (US), and for predicting the magnitude of resistance in this setting. In the renewal our work will be extended by combining mathematical modeling with statistical analysis of datasets collected by collaborating groups in the US, Europe and Africa. We will have access to data on drug resistance and important related variables from large scale epidemiological and treatment studies conducted in these three continents. In resource-poor settings, such as Africa, drugs will be limited and thus demand will often greatly exceed supply. We will investigate the problems of allocating ARVs in Africa by using operation research (OR) techniques. We have three Specific Aims. Aim 1: to understand the emergence, explain the present, and predict the evolution of, complex epidemics of drug-resistant strains of HIV in the US and Europe. Aim 2: to predict the evolution of epidemics of drug-resistant strains, as a result of first- line regimens and prophylactic use of ARVs, in Africa. Aim 3: to evaluate the consequences of allocation of scarce HIV healthcare resources in Africa. To achieve this aim we will use models to evaluate the epidemiological and ethical consequences of gender-inequities in access to treatment, assess the epidemiological and ethical impact of treatment priority criteria, and determine healthcare resource allocation strategies that ensure sustainability. Our studies in the renewal will link transmission modeling, OR techniques and statistical analyses; our analyses will take advantage of the extraordinary data sets provided by our collaborators in the US, Europe and Africa.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The emergence and control of drug-resistant strains of HIV is now a global problem. The epidemiology of this problem is complex, and the future of the HIV epidemic is unknown. Our projects focus on using mathematical models to understand, explain, and predict, the evolution of complex epidemics composed of drug-resistant strains of HIV in the US, Europe and Africa. The rollout of antiretrovirals in Africa is just beginning; however demand for drugs greatly exceeds supply. We will, by using mathematical models, evaluate the epidemiological and ethical consequences of allocation of the scarce supply of antiretrovirals in Africa. Our studies are based upon both mathematical modeling and data analyses. Our analyses will take advantage of the extraordinary data sets provided by our collaborators in the US, Europe and Africa. Our results will have direct relevance for health policy makers.

"Prescription drugs misuse and risky sexual behaviors among YMSM in Philadelphia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-medical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD), i.e. opioids, tranquilizers, or stimulants, is a serious and growing public health problem in the U.S. Most data on NMUPD among young adults is limited to the heterosexual college population while significant knowledge gaps exist regarding NMUPD among young men who have sex with men (YMSM). Given the well-established intersection of drug use and risky sexual behaviors and high rates of HIV infections in YMSM, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between these drugs and physical, sexual and psychological health of YMSM. YMSM have unique concerns for health risks, such as depression, suicide, bullying, victimization, homelessness, and homophobia, but little is known of their intersection with NMUPD. Many YMSM experience normative pressures that encourage risky behaviors. At the same time, some forms of social support and resilience may buffer against negative effects of stressors. Significant gaps exist in our understanding of how these factors relate to problematic patterns of NMUPD, and whether they modify engagement in risky sexual behaviors. The objective of this study is to contribute directly to our understanding of the social factors that influence NMUPD and risky sexual behaviors among YMSM. The long-term goal of the study is to guide public health practitioners towards developing strategies that will prevent negative effects of NMUPD on YMSM, including reducing disparities in rates of HIV infection among YMSM. The study will investigate the central hypothesis of a deleterious relationship between NMUPD and physical, sexual, and psychological health of YMSM. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1: Determine patterns of NMUPD and risky sexual behavior among YMSM in Philadelphia; Aim 2: Determine the risk and protective factors contributing to NMUPD and risky sexual behavior among YMSM; Aim 3: Explore the social contexts of NMPUD. Aims 1 and 2 will be addressed by recruiting 190 YMSM ages 18-29 in Philadelphia who have recently misused prescription drugs. Aim 3 will be addressed by selecting a subsample of 25 YMSM for a qualitative study. This approach is innovative because it utilizes a conceptual framework that combines a minority stress model and theories of social norms, social support, and resilience; it focuses on a critical cohort of under-researched, hard-to-reach population; and it employs two research methodologies. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance and expand our understanding of the effects of an emerging phenomena (i.e., prescription drug misuse) on adverse consequences of sexual activity. It will also contribute to a better understanding of the role of social determinants on dug use and risky sexual behavior. Such knowledge may inform the development of evidence-based strategies that will prevent adverse health and psychological effects of NMUPD on YMSM and their communities in Philadelphia and elsewhere in the U.S.         The proposed research is relevant to the part of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) mission that pertains to implementation of a research agenda designed to advance knowledge related to understanding sexual minorities health and health disparities. The proposed research is relevant to the part of National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) mission pertaining to studies that address past and current risk and protective factors, including unique dimensions associated with drug use and abuse and other HIV risk behaviors among vulnerable youth, such as YMSM.",Prescription drugs misuse and risky sexual behaviors among YMSM in Philadelphia,8959646,R36DA034543,[''],NIDA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R36,2013,5291,0.04582569203240005
"Drug Use Among Hispanic Emerging Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among Hispanic adolescents, cultural factors such as acculturation, perceived discrimination, and acculturative stress are risk factors for drug use. Previous studies suggest that the effects of acculturation on drug use may be mediated by family functioning; when adolescents acculturate more rapidly than their parents, the parent- child acculturation discrepancy can lead to breakdowns in family communication and cohesion and increases in family conflict, which in turn can lead to risky behaviors such as drug use among the adolescents. Although there is considerable information about the role of family acculturation patterns in drug use among Hispanic adolescents, we do not know how family acculturation patterns affect adolescents as they transition into the next stage of life, emerging adulthood. Emerging adulthood, a provisional stage in which young adults try out adult roles but may not become firmly entrenched in them, is characterized by identity exploration, residential instability, self-focus, a subjective feeling of being between adolescence and true adulthood, and increased opportunities. In general, individuals who navigate this transition smoothly emerge with a more developed sense of identity, successful interpersonal relationships, new life roles, and minimal levels of substance use. However, the high level of independence and low level of social constraints that occur during emerging adulthood also make this a high-risk period for drug use and other problem behaviors. Understanding how factors in adolescence affect drug use in early adulthood can lead to better intervention efforts for adolescents. More research is needed to determine how cultural factors influence the transition to emerging adulthood among Hispanics and to identify the risk factors for escalation of drug use during this pivotal transition. This continuation application proposes to follow an established cohort of Hispanic adolescents (12th graders in the 2008-2009 school year) for an additional 4 years to identify the predictors of their drug use trajectories during the transition to emerging adulthood. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are the following: (1) Conduct an additional 4 annual surveys of the participants; (2) Construct individual growth curves to describe their use of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs; (3) Identify the predictors of the growth curve parameters, including cultural factors, peer factors, substance use during high school, psychological factors, and demographic factors; (4) Evaluate emerging adulthood variables as potential mediators of these influences, including identity exploration, experimentation / possibilities, instability (residential mobility, role transitions), self-focus, and subjective experience of being in-between adolescence and adulthood; and (5) Make recommendations for the development of improved health education messages to prevent drug use among acculturating Hispanics during the transition to emerging adulthood.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application addresses the public health goals of preventing and reducing substance use among young adults. It also aims to reduce health disparities by identifying risk and protective factors that are specific to Hispanics.

"Substance Use and Risky Sex in Highly Vulnerable Populations The proposed project will help me develop the skills and expertise necessary to establish an independent research career focused on the role of substance use in sexual risk-taking behavior and associated adverse reproductive outcomes, especially sexually transmitted infections (STIs). To achieve this goal, I will supplement my graduate training as a developmental psychologist and post-doctoral training in epidemiology with training in sexual risk behavior in vulnerable populations, health disparities associated with race, and career development in longitudinal research methodology. Complementary to these training activities, I propose: 1) secondary data analyses of sexual risk behavior and outcomes using data from an ongoing longitudinal study of the offspring of teenage mothers and a study of women with and without borderline personality disorder (BPD); 2) collection of new data on the offspring of teenage mothers during a 16-year assessment and; 3) a new pilot study of common STIs in this sample (offspring of teenage mothers). The proposed research will form the basis for an ROI application in the third year of the award period. My short term goals are to (1) increase knowledge about risk for STIs, including behavioral dysregulation that may underlie risky sex and risk factors associated with risky sex and associated outcomes, (2) learn new methods of measuring risk behavior and adverse reproductive outcomes, including clinical tests for STIs and event-level assessments, (3) learn more about health disparities associated with race, and (4) develop the research skills that will enable me to become an independent investigator and obtain NIH funding to support my research, specifically longitudinal data analyses. My long-term career goal is to understand the ecological setting for drug use and sexual risk behaviors in vulnerable populations, and how drug use may contribute to significantly higher rates of unintended pregnancies and STIs in African-American youth. The proposed career development training will take place at the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. This department provides an outstanding environment for interdisciplinary training by highly collaborative faculty who are leading experts in their chosen fields. RELEVANCE (See Instructions): The proposed research will help identify behavioral risk factors for sexually transmitted infections that are implicated in higher rates of HIV, especially among African-Americans. The results can be used to develop prevention programs aimed at reducing drug use and sexually transmitted infections among vulnerable adolescents and within psychiatric populations.

"Yale Drug Abuse, Addiction, and HIV Research Scholars (Yale-DAHRS)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a critical need to develop a diverse pool of highly trained clinician scholars to foster the development of biomedical, behavioral and clinical research related to drug abuse, addiction, and HIV prevention and treatment in general medical settings. Patients who abuse substances are more likely to be seen in general medical settings such as emergency departments (ED), general medical primary care clinics and inpatient wards, HIV and adolescent health clinics, and women's health centers. These patients often present with a complex array of acute consequences and complications (e.g. intoxication, overdose, withdrawal, trauma and infectious diseases) of substance use as well as chronic conditions such as HIV disease, hepatitis, pulmonary and cardiovascular disease. Objectives: The Yale-Drug Abuse, Addiction, and HIV Research Scholars (DAHRS) program provides a comprehensive three year post-doctorate, interdisciplinary, Mentored Career Development Program to improve drug abuse, addiction, and HIV medical outcomes integrating prevention and treatment in general medical settings including ED, primary care, HIV, adolescent, and women's health clinics. Specifically, Yale-DAHRS will: [Aim 1] Develop clinician scientists with the knowledge, skills, and ability to become independent investigators, generating findings of practical value with significant impact to improve health outcomes of patients with and at risk for drug abuse, addiction, and HIV; [Aim 2] Develop future leaders by providing Scholars with leadership tools and skills and creating individualized programs to ensure success in leading multidisciplinary research teams in studying drug abuse, addiction and HIV, and implementation and integration of research findings into general medical settings; and [Aim 3] Enhance the diversity of drug abuse, addiction, and HIV researchers. Addressing women and minority faculty under representation will enhance the diversity of investigators and research topics, broaden perspectives in setting research priorities, increase clinical trial participation, and expand knowledge. Working synergistically with Yale's established training programs in drug abuse, HIV and clinical investigation, Yale- DAHRS will capitalize on existing academic infrastructure and expertise to ensure success. Unique, features include: (1) An interdisciplinary, diverse faculty of independent researchers in illicit and prescription drug abuse and addiction, tobacco, alcohol, HIV, and medical complexities such as pain and hepatitis C; (2) Synergy with well established, high quality post-doctoral training programs at Yale; (3) The use of clinical informatics for data collection, data management, diagnostic tool development, and information dissemination; and (4) The integration of such diverse fields as public health, informatics, clinical epidemiology, systems engineering and demography with the traditional clinical sciences of internal medicine, emergency medicine, HIV medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry, and psychology; (5) Established clinical research laboratories, including the Yale-New Haven Hospital, a tertiary care center for southern New England and a community hospital for the Greater New Haven Area, serving an ethnically, racially, culturally, and economically diverse population, a Veterans Affairs Medical Center and community treatment centers such as the APT Foundation and Federally Qualified Health Centers; (6) Synergies with established research centers and institutes such as the Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS and the Veterans Aging Cohort on HIV. Career Development Plan: Yale-DAHRS is a three year research training program that will prepare a total of six clinician investigators for careers focusing on drug abuse, addiction, and HIV in general medical settings during its first funding cycle. Scholars will earn the Master in Health Sciences degree, combining rigorous training in research methodology, statistics and design with seminars in topics related to drug abuse, addiction, and HIV content, leadership, grant writing and responsible conduct of research. Candidates will complete published mentored research project(s) and prepare an application for the next career step; i.e. NIH R21, R03, R15, R34 mechanism. The collaboration of the multidisciplinary faculty and the combined robust strengths of two principal investigators from Emergency and Internal Medicine, both with extensive experience mentoring and as independent funded investigators will drive the Yale-DAHRS program. Potential Research Projects: Multiple research projects are ""shovel ready"" for Scholar training and can be completed within our allotted time frame, such as secondary data analysis using national large datasets e.g. VA Aging Cohort (HIV); risk factors, prevention and treatment of prescription drug abuse, office-based treatment of opioid dependence with buprenorphine, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, creation of cost effective evaluation models for patients with drug abuse, addiction and HIV including prescription drug abuse; investigation of gender and racial/ethnic disparities in identification and treatment interventions and outcomes; evaluation of screening, and treatment initiation in special populations (i.e. adolescent-elderly, veterans, incarcerated, HIV); comparison of models of screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) delivery by providers and other innovative technologies; effectiveness and implementation of SBIRT science in general medicine practice with acute and chronic medical complexities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Drug abuse, addiction, and HIV are significant public health issues, as they affect the health and well-being of a large portion of the population; have substantial negative health outcomes on individuals; and are extremely costly to the health care system. An investment in research to improve substance abuse and medical health outcomes is greatly needed. The proposed Yale-Drug Abuse, Addiction, and HIV Research Scholars (DAHRS) program focusing on general medical settings with patients throughout the life cycle will provide a three year post-doctoral, interdisciplinary, Mentored Career Development Program training six clinician-scientists for independent research careers in the field of drug abuse, addiction, and HIV through integration of prevention and treatment in general medical settings.            ","Yale Drug Abuse, Addiction, and HIV Research Scholars (Yale-DAHRS)",8510031,K12DA033312,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency

"The Development of a Video-Enhanced Drug Prevention Program for Rural Native Hawa    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research has indicated that Native Hawaiian youth have significantly higher rates of drug use than their non-Hawaiian counterparts (e.g., Wong, Klingle, & Price, 2004; Mayeda, Hishinuma, Nishimura, Garcia- Santiago, & Mark, 2006), and that these differences are particularly pronounced in rural settings (Lai & Saka, 2005). Despite these findings, there have been very few drug prevention programs developed and evaluated specifically for these youth (Edwards, Giroux, & Okamoto, in press; Rehuher, Hiramatsu, & Helm, 2008). Therefore, the purpose of this exploratory research proposal is to develop and pilot test curricular components of a video-based, culturally-grounded drug prevention program for rural Native Hawaiian youth. This will be accomplished through three specific aims. AIM 1 is to create 3-5 video vignettes focused on relevant drug related problem situations of rural Hawaiian youth. The vignettes will focus on common and difficult drug offer situations for these youth, as well as the range of responses to each situation, established from prior NIDA- funded research (5 K01 DA019884). AIM 2 is to develop the accompanying drug prevention curricular components to compliment the video vignettes developed in Aim 1. AIM 3 is to pilot test the resulting curricular components for program feasibility and measurement, using a combination of focus group interviews with stakeholders (e.g., Hawaiian youth, youth-serving practitioners) and selected classroom implementation within four middle schools. Comparison of the intervention components against four attentional-control schools will be conducted, in order to estimate effect sizes for a future large-scale, randomized controlled trial (to be implemented as part of a future R01 grant).       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Because Hawaiians or part-Hawaiians represent the largest Pacific Islander population in the U.S. (Harris & Jones, 2005) and have been shown to have higher rates of alcohol consumption and smoking compared with other ethnic groups (Office of Minority Health, 2009), research focused on drug prevention of these individuals is important to improve public health both in Hawai'i and on the Mainland U.S. This study actively engages rural communities in the development of the curricular components of a drug prevention intervention for Hawaiian youth, promoting the overall utility and effectiveness of those components. Further, the findings from this study will point to the core content of prevention interventions for Hawaiian youth in rural communities, which may be applicable to other ethnic youth populations in Hawai'i and the Pacific Rim, as well as Native youth populations on the Mainland U.S.         ",The Development of a Video-Enhanced Drug Prevention Program for Rural Native Hawa,8434894,R34DA031306,"['etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Island ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rural Health ', ' Schools ', ' Smoking ', ' Testing ', ' Videotape ', ' Accountability ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' Rural Community ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Measurement ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Hawaiian ', ' Hawaiian population ', ' programs ', ' Test Result ', ' Outcome Study ', ' middle school ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Indigenous ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' American Indian and Alaska Native ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' minority health ', ' Population ', ' Drug Prevention Program ', ' native youth ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIDA,HAWAII PACIFIC UNIVERSITY,R34,2013,150254,0.10748684686714759
"Interdisciplinary Research Training Institute on Hispanic Drug Abuse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Interdisciplinary Research Training Institute (IRTI) on Hispanic Drug Abuse seeks to promote the career development of pre-doctoral, postdoctoral and early career clinically-focused scientists interested in conducting research as it affects the Hispanic population.

"Randomized Trial of IFCBT-HIVPI to Prevent HIV Among Non-Injection Drug Users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a second revision of a competitive renewal R01 proposal of the NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study in response to NIDA PAS-07-115 (Non-injection Dug Abuse and HIV/AIDS). The primary study aim is to evaluate the ability of Integrated Family and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy-HIV Prevention Intervention (IFCBT-HIVPI) to prevent HIV among adult non-injection and injection drug users. Over a 12 week intervention interval, the IFCBT-HIVPI model coordinates the delivery of cognitive- behavioral components during 12 group sessions with a couples and family systems component during 4 couples/family sessions to address HIV risk and protective factors across multiple ecological systems. IFCBT-HIVPI main effects on primary (HIV sexual risk behaviors and HIV drug taking risk behaviors) and secondary (HIV, Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis incidences and legal involvement, academic achievement, and employment) outcome domains will be evaluated. We also seek to elucidate the degree to which the development of attitudinal and behavior change skills targeted by IFCBT-HIVPI (e.g., rational beliefs, problem solving skill, adaptive couples' communication) result in post-intervention reductions of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and HIV risk behaviors. The possibility of effect-modification is also considered with a focus on route of drug administration status (i.e., non-injector/injector), neuropsychological (e.g., executive function), and demographic (i.e., African American/white) factors. The proposed study will randomly assign 360 HIV-negative non-injection and injection drug users recruited from the original NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study sample to experimental (IFCBT-HIVPI) and comparison (Brief Psychoeducation Curriculum on HIV Prevention; BPEC-HIV) conditions. The composition of the original NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study sample provides the basis to stratify the randomized trial sample across gender and two race/ethnicity (i.e., African American and white) groups by route of drug administration status. An assessment battery comprised of a standardized interview on HIV risk behavior, neuropsychological tests, tools to assess attitudes and behavior change skills targeted by IFCBT-HIVPI, drug and STI urine testing, and serologic tests of HIV will be administered before, during, and after the intervention interval across 18-month post-intervention follow-up. Additional preliminary analyses will be conducted on the randomized trial data to: (1) derive session-by-session measures on mechanisms of change targeted by IFCBT-HIVPI via videotape coding methods; (2) characterize mechanisms of change trajectories that may then be evaluated as plausible intervention moderators if present; and (3) estimate intervention cost-effectiveness. The lack of research on science-based prevention interventions for HIV continues to be a serious gap in the literature with recent HIV trends highlighting significant health disparities, particularly among African American non-injection drug users. If successful, the proposed project should help to identify specific attitudinal and behavior change skills targeted by cognitive- behavioral and couples/family systems interventions that foster subsequent reductions in HIV, STIs and HIV risk behaviors among adult drug users at heightened disease risk.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent estimates suggest that a majority of the 40,000 new cases of HIV reported annually in the US are attributable largely to sexual risk behavior associated with non-injection drug use. Additionally, African American drug users exhibit substantial HIV health disparities with African American females being 21 times more likely to contract HIV than white females. The proposed project is designed to address critical gaps in the HIV prevention science field by evaluating the ability of an intervention coordinating cognitive-behavioral and couples/family systems components to prevent HIV among adult drug users at heightened disease risk.

"Brief intervention for drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV/HCV     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this study is to reduce risk behaviors and increase health and behavioral health service utilization among disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV and HCV. This project has potential to make a significant contribution to science by advancing knowledge about the health disparities, high-risk behaviors (injection drug use, sex risk), and service utilization of this high-risk, vulnerable, an understudied group of women during a time of emerging and significant public health risk in an Appalachian rural setting. This project will incorporate standardized screening (NIDA-modified ASSIST) to identify high-risk rural women drug users from jails, including injectors. Consenting women (N=350) will be asked to participate in a baseline interview, and will then be randomly assigned to one of two study groups: (1) HIV Education (HIV- Ed n=175) which includes the NIDA standard pre and post-test counseling, HIV and HCV rapid testing, and an information packet on existing community drug abuse and HIV/HCV resources; or (2) Motivational Interviewing- based HIV Risk Reduction (MI-HIV n=175) which, in addition to what is received in the HIV-Ed group, also includes an evidence-based brief intervention for high-risk women focused on an individualized plan for enhancing motivation to reduce risk behaviors and to use health and behavioral health services in the community. Specific aims include: (1) to compare the effectiveness of an evidence-based HIV risk reduction intervention (MI-HIV) to HIV Education (NIDA Standard) in reducing sex risk behaviors, injection practices, and drug use among a culturally unique sample of disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV and HCV; and (2) to examine MI-HIV Intervention engagement as a predictor of community health and behavioral health service utilization (including drug treatment and mental health) at follow-up among disadvantaged, drug- using rural women at high risk for HIV and HCV. This project is innovative because it 1) targets a high-risk and understudied group of women, 2) uses brief intervention to not only reduce risk behavior but also to enhance motivation for using community health and behavioral health resources, and 3) utilizes a real-world setting to identify high-risk women drug users. The long-term goal of this study is to increase access to health and behavioral health services in order to improve the quality of health of high-risk rural women.          The overall aim of this study is to reduce risk behaviors and increase health and behavioral health service utilization among disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high risk for HIV and HCV. This project has potential to make a significant contribution to science by providing knowledge about the health, risk behaviors, and service utilization of a vulnerable and understudied group of women during a time of emerging and significant public health risk in a rural Appalachian setting. Successful completion of the aims of this project will advance the delivery of a low-cost, potentially high impact intervention with implications for a number of other real world settings (such as criminal justice venues) where other disadvantaged high-risk drug users can be identified and targeted for intervention.

"National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse (NHSN) Annual Conference Abstract  This R13 meetings grant application seeks support for five yearly three-day stand alone conferences to be held at selected locations beginning in the fall of 2009. This proposal reflects a collaborative initiative between Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center and the National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse (NHSN), based at the University of Miami. The annual scientific conferences help to accomplish the NHSN mission of fostering both interdisciplinary and translational research, by promoting dialogue between biologic, social, behavioral, and cultural scientists and disseminating findings back to the field. Previous conferences, supported through a NIDA-funded contract, have been an effective platform for developing the aims of the NHSN, with particular emphasis on mentoring and training Hispanic graduate students and early career scientists.    The aims of the conferences will be: A) to advance science in the area of drug abuse research and its co-morbid conditions, particularly as it impacts on the Hispanic population. It will promote bidirectional translational research ranging from bench to community and a trans-disciplinary cross-fertilization of ideas among scientists from all fields of drug abuse helping to establish future research priorities. B) To foster the development of Hispanic researchers, with emphasis in areas related to drug abuse research by facilitating the development of integrated and continuous collaborative and mentoring networks. Funding is requested to support participation for 50 trainees/early career scientists and 20 research scientists presenting in the scientific panels. An average of 150 participants, representing the field from the national and international scientific communities, are expected at each yearly conference, including members of the global research community whose interests encompass a multifaceted approach to understanding the factors underlying health disparities as they pertain to drug use and abuse ranging from epidemiology to environmental health, psychology, sociology, health policy, neuroscience and other biomedical sciences, and epigenetics.    The first conference proposed ""Integrating Population, Laboratory, and Clinical Sciences in Minority Health"" will be hosted by the University of Miami, from December 1-3, 2009. The format of the conference aims to provide ample opportunity for discussion, networking, and collaboration discussions as well as development of new ideas related to training and mentoring of the next generation of researchers in the field of drug abuse.

"Contextualizing & responding to HIV risk behaviors among Black drug offenders     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Formerly incarcerated Black drug offenders are at an elevated risk for HIV infection. Despite substantial research expressing the need for HIV prevention services for ex-offenders post-release, this population has limited access to quality programming and services related to HIV risk reduction. This K01 application seeks to inform and adapt an HIV risk reduction intervention to address the needs of formerly incarcerated Black drug offenders who are being released from prisons in the New York City metropolitan area. This application supports the Principal Investigator's interest in becoming an independent behavioral scientist specializing in HIV prevention intervention development and adaptation. The proposed mentorship and training program will focus on the following key areas: mixed methods research; adaptation science; and intervention implementation. The proposed study will occur in three phases implemented over the course of five years. The formative phase will consist of survey administration on HIV literacy, needs and barriers to practicing protective behaviors, and HIV testing from 120 recently released Black drug offenders. Also during this phase, in-depth interviews with a subsample of 24 participants (12 male and 12 female participants) will also be conducted to gather more comprehensive information exploring needs and barriers to practicing HIV protective behaviors. The intervention development and adaptation phase, will consist of analyzing data from the survey research and in-depth interviews to tailor it for use with recently released Black drug offenders. In phase 3, the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted intervention will be pilot tested using a randomized clinical trial with 64 participants who are randomized to the adapted intervention or an Enhanced Referral Intervention arm. Building on the Information-Motivation and Behavioral Skills Model, this study will address the following specific aims: 1) To examine individual-level, environmental and contextual factors that affect HIV risk-related behaviors (i.e. illicit drug use and risky sexual behavior) among formerly incarcerated Black male and female drug offenders; 2) To adapt Project START, an HIV risk reduction intervention for formerly incarcerated men, using data gathered from Aim 1, to increase access to HIV testing and address drivers of HIV vulnerability among recently released Black male and female drug offenders; and 3) To pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted Project START using a randomized clinical trial with 64 participants (32 men, 32 women). The proposed study will utilize a mixed-methods approach to investigate drivers of HIV risk among recently released Black drug offenders. By providing more contextual information on risk behaviors, future evidence-based approaches can be developed and rapidly deployed, advancing HIV prevention science, and providing essential support for a vulnerable population that consistently experiences barriers in accessing HIV prevention services.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K01 application seeks to inform and adapt an HIV risk reduction intervention to address the needs of formerly incarcerated Black drug offenders who are being released from prisons in the New York City metropolitan area. The proposed mentorship and training program will focus on the following key areas: mixed methods research; adaptation science; and intervention implementation. A mixed methods approach will be used to conceptualize HIV risk related behaviors among this population, resulting in the development of a novel approach to better understanding and ultimately addressing racial disparities in HIV prevalence.                    ",Contextualizing & responding to HIV risk behaviors among Black drug offenders,8603594,K01DA036411,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Housing ', ' Interview ', ' literacy ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Study models ', ' Motivation ', ' New York City ', ' jail inmate ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' Prisoner ', ' Prisons ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Illicit Drugs ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Drug user ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' criminal offender ', ' offender ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' Institution ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Prevention education ', ' neglect ', ' protective behavior ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Guide prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' arm ', ' drug offender ', ' ']",NIDA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2013,142075,0.0825246084870777
"Developmental Pathways to Substance Use Across European & Asian American Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As one of the fastest growing ethnic minority groups in the United States, alcohol and drug use in American Americans has increasingly been recognized as a public health problem. Emerging research has documented biological, psychosocial, and cultural factors that are associated with alcohol use in Asian American youth adults (Hendershot et al., 2005). However, existing studies have neither adopted a developmental perspective to study the emergence of alcohol use and problems in Asian American during late adolescence, nor have they tested whether prior findings can be generalized to predict drug use and problems. Concurrently, evidence from a separate line of research has suggested that effects of parenting are often different across Asian and European American youth. Numerous studies, for example, have suggested that authoritarian parenting style has beneficial effects in Asian American youth, but detrimental effects in European American youth on outcomes such as academic performance and socio-emotional competence. Subsequent research has indicated that parental constructs such as emotional support and psychological control may also have differential effects across Asian and European American youth (e.g., Chao & Tseng, 2002). Despite these findings, no published study has documented differential effects of parenting on alcohol and drug use across Asian and European American youth. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to examine moderation effects by ethnicity on the association between parenting and alcohol and drug use outcomes in a longitudinal sample of Asian and European American youth. Specifically, the proposed study will test whether parental emotional support, psychological control and monitoring have differential effects on alcohol and drug use outcomes across Asian and European American youth. Data will be drawn from 97 Asian American and 255 European American youth who participated in the Developmental Pathway Project. Structural equation modeling and factor analysis techniques will be used to test (1) whether parental emotional support, psychological control, and monitoring in 7th grade will differentially predict alcohol and drug use outcomes in 9th and 12th grade across Asian and European American youth; (2) whether developmental pathways from parenting to alcohol and drug use outcomes (via school achievement and peer substance use in 8th grade) are different across Asian and European American youth; and (3) whether the hypothesized moderation effects by ethnicity can be attributed to different interpretation of parenting, as suggested by prior research (e.g., Chao & Aque, 2009). Results from the proposed study can be used to guide the development of culturally sensitive prevention and intervention programs for alcohol and drug use in Asian American youth. The proposed project addresses a strategic goal of the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) on the prevention of alcohol and drug use through understanding risk and protective factors in adolescence, a developmental stage during which substance use increases over time. This project also addresses NIDA's cross-cutting priorities of decreasing health disparity related to drug addiction and training new investigators from a diverse (including minority) background. The ultimate goal of this project is to limit substance use initiation and problematic use through the development of culturally sensitive prevention and intervention programs for Asian American youth.",Developmental Pathways to Substance Use Across European & Asian American Youth,8516912,F31AA020700,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Asian Americans ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Influentials ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Competence ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Genetic ', ' Staging ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Techniques ', ' psychosocial ', ' Equation ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' intervention program ', ' Structure ', ' alcohol metabolism ', ' Ethanol Metabolism ', ' skills ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' intimacy ', ' intimate behavior ', ' 7th grade ', ' seventh grade ', ' 8th grade ', ' eighth grade ', ' high school freshman ', ' 9th grade ', ' ninth grade ', ' high school senior ', ' 12th grade ', ' twelfth grade ', ' youth alcohol consumption ', ' underage alcohol use ', ' underage alcohol consumption ', ' under age alcohol use ', ' under age alcohol consumption ', ' teenager alcohol use ', ' teenage drinking ', ' teenage alcohol use ', ' teen drinking ', ' drinking during adolescence ', ' alcohol use during adolescence ', ' alcohol intake among adolescents ', ' alcohol during adolescence ', ' adolescent drinking ', ' adolescent alcohol use ', ' adolescent alcohol consumption ', ' Youth Drinking ', ' underage drinking ', ' Reporting ', ' parent monitoring ', ' parental monitoring ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Data ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' South Asian ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' adolescent smoking ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' early adolescence ', ' reduce adolescent alcohol ', ' alcohol use prevention ', ' deter alcohol use ', ' ']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2013,38560,0.04928523229381242
"Randomized Trial of IFCBT-HIVPI to Prevent HIV Among Non-Injection Drug Users    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a second revision of a competitive renewal R01 proposal of the NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study in response to NIDA PAS-07-115 (Non-injection Dug Abuse and HIV/AIDS). The primary study aim is to evaluate the ability of Integrated Family and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy-HIV Prevention Intervention (IFCBT-HIVPI) to prevent HIV among adult non-injection and injection drug users. Over a 12 week intervention interval, the IFCBT-HIVPI model coordinates the delivery of cognitive- behavioral components during 12 group sessions with a couples and family systems component during 4 couples/family sessions to address HIV risk and protective factors across multiple ecological systems. IFCBT-HIVPI main effects on primary (HIV sexual risk behaviors and HIV drug taking risk behaviors) and secondary (HIV, Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis incidences and legal involvement, academic achievement, and employment) outcome domains will be evaluated. We also seek to elucidate the degree to which the development of attitudinal and behavior change skills targeted by IFCBT-HIVPI (e.g., rational beliefs, problem solving skill, adaptive couples' communication) result in post-intervention reductions of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and HIV risk behaviors. The possibility of effect-modification is also considered with a focus on route of drug administration status (i.e., non-injector/injector), neuropsychological (e.g., executive function), and demographic (i.e., African American/white) factors. The proposed study will randomly assign 360 HIV-negative non-injection and injection drug users recruited from the original NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study sample to experimental (IFCBT-HIVPI) and comparison (Brief Psychoeducation Curriculum on HIV Prevention; BPEC-HIV) conditions. The composition of the original NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study sample provides the basis to stratify the randomized trial sample across gender and two race/ethnicity (i.e., African American and white) groups by route of drug administration status. An assessment battery comprised of a standardized interview on HIV risk behavior, neuropsychological tests, tools to assess attitudes and behavior change skills targeted by IFCBT-HIVPI, drug and STI urine testing, and serologic tests of HIV will be administered before, during, and after the intervention interval across 18-month post-intervention follow-up. Additional preliminary analyses will be conducted on the randomized trial data to: (1) derive session-by-session measures on mechanisms of change targeted by IFCBT-HIVPI via videotape coding methods; (2) characterize mechanisms of change trajectories that may then be evaluated as plausible intervention moderators if present; and (3) estimate intervention cost-effectiveness. The lack of research on science-based prevention interventions for HIV continues to be a serious gap in the literature with recent HIV trends highlighting significant health disparities, particularly among African American non-injection drug users. If successful, the proposed project should help to identify specific attitudinal and behavior change skills targeted by cognitive- behavioral and couples/family systems interventions that foster subsequent reductions in HIV, STIs and HIV risk behaviors among adult drug users at heightened disease risk.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent estimates suggest that a majority of the 40,000 new cases of HIV reported annually in the US are attributable largely to sexual risk behavior associated with non-injection drug use. Additionally, African American drug users exhibit substantial HIV health disparities with African American females being 21 times more likely to contract HIV than white females. The proposed project is designed to address critical gaps in the HIV prevention science field by evaluating the ability of an intervention coordinating cognitive-behavioral and couples/family systems components to prevent HIV among adult drug users at heightened disease risk.

"Natural History of HIV Infection In Injection Drug Users     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs) represent a marginalized population with substantial disparities in health care access and outcomes. With improved survival due to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV has transformed into a chronic disease. In addition to HIV disease, IDUs also suffer from a syndemic of other chronic diseases including substance abuse, mental health disorders, and non-AIDS comorbidities. Proposed is a continuation of the ALIVE cohort study, among the largest, longest-running and productive IDU cohorts worldwide, and which has followed disadvantaged, primarily African American IDUs in Baltimore, MD since 1988. With advancing age and multimorbidity, the comprehensiveness of care will increasingly determine HIV-infected IDUs quality and quantity of life. We hypothesize that the key determinants of optimal HIV care (e.g., active drug use, provider relationships, social networks, neighborhood factors) may also determine effective comprehensive care for HIV-infected IDUs. While this cohort has and continues to be a platform for an array of studies all critical to addressing questions about the long-term course and consequences of HIV disease and its treatment among IDUs, this proposal emphasizes: 1) improved identification of HIV-infected IDUs most likely to respond optimally to ART. We will examine longitudinal trajectories of drug use and HIV RNA to define membership in optimal vs. sub-optimal response groups, and then quantitatively identify behavioral and clinical correlates and qualitatively examine barriers and coping mechanisms which underlie the ability to optimally respond. 2) To investigate the determinants and consequences of comprehensive care for HIV-infected IDUs from patient, clinical and societal perspectives. Comprehensive care for HIV-infected IDUs extends beyond HIV-focused aspects to include care for chronic comorbid diseases, substance abuse, and mental health conditions. We propose a framework that considers measures of effective comprehensive care from patient (perceived effectiveness), clinical (adherence to quality care indicators) and societal (service utilization) points of view. Building on prior investigation of individual-, provider-, and neighborhood-level factors associated with HAART effectiveness, we will identify determinants of quality comprehensive care. Extending our multi-level framework in this proposal, we will also evaluate the role of social networks (e.g. 'care-engaged' network members) on comprehensive care. Finally, we examine comprehensive care effectiveness in relation to patient-reported (quality-of-life), clinica (multimorbidity, physical performance) and societal (QALYs) outcomes. To achieve these aims, we continue biannual visits with interview, exam, and biospecimen collection supplemented by medical record review and registry linkage. The ALIVE study remains well-positioned to address the emerging issues confronting the healthy aging of HIV-infected IDUs, namely optimizing long-term ART and enhancing comprehensiveness of care.          This proposal addresses the primary issues confronting the healthy aging of HIV-infected injection drug users, namely optimizing long-term antiretroviral therapy and enhancing the comprehensiveness of care, not just for HIV disease, but also for substance abuse, mental health conditions, and chronic diseases. Nested in the long- standing ALIVE cohort study, the proposed aims will improve understanding of effective comprehensive care from patient, clinical and societal perspectives, and will inform strategies to optimize care and improve outcomes for persons aging with HIV infection.

"Familias Unidas Stage III Study: Preventing Substance Abuse in Hispanic Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study's overarching goal is to reduce the ethnic disparities in illicit drug use, cigarette use, and HIV between Hispanic and non-Hispanic youth. This goal will be accomplished by four aims: AIM 1 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Practice (i.e., standard prevention services), in preventing illicit drug use; AIM 2 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Control, in preventing cigarette use; AIM 3 is to evaluate the effectiveness of Familias Unidas, relative to Community Control, in preventing unprotected sexual behavior; and AIM 4 is to assess the extent to which family functioning mediates the effects of the intervention on illicit drug use, cigarette use, and unprotected sexual behavior. Twenty four middle schools with a total sample of 744 Hispanic adolescents from a wide geographic area of Miami-Dade County will be randomized using a block design to one of two conditions: Familias Unidas or Community Practice. The Familias Unidas intervention has been evaluated and found to be efficacious in two separate randomized controlled trials. In the first study (Pantin et al., 2003), Familias Unidas was shown to be efficacious relative to a no intervention control condition in increasing family functioning and reducing behavior problems (Prado et al., 2006), risk factors for youth illicit drug use and unprotected sex. In the second randomized controlled trial (Prado et al., in press), Familias Unidas was found to be efficacious, relative to two attention control conditions, in preventing cigarette use and illicit drug use. Familias Unidas was also found to be efficacious relative to both of the control conditions in preventing/reducing unprotected sexual behavior at last sexual intercourse. Finally, family functioning was found to mediate the effects of intervention condition on the outcomes. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) will be used to test: (H1) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing illicit drug use over time; (H2) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing cigarette use over time; and (H3) Familias Unidas will be more effective than Community Practice in reducing unprotected sexual behavior over time. Additionally HLM will be used to determine whether (H1a) the effect of Familias Unidas on illicit drug use will be partially mediated by family functioning; (H2a) the effect of Familias Unidas on cigarette use will be partially mediated by family functioning and (H3a) the effect of Familias Unidas on unprotected sexual behavior will be partially mediated by family functioning.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of the proposed study is to reduce illicit drug use, cigarette use, and unsafe sexual behavior health disparities in Hispanic populations. The knowledge expected to be gained from this study will aid in the development of effective interventions to reduce drug use, cigarette use, unprotected sexual behavior, and HIV in Hispanic adolescents.

"The Logics for HIV Risk among Street-Based Heroin Injectors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a theoretically and ethnographically informed model of ""HIV risk environment"" for public health intervention by identifying the key structural forces, institutional processes, and socio-cultural constraints that shape HIV behaviors among inner-city street-based drug users. We will examine the social processes that drive the logics for HIV transmission behaviors among street-based injection drug users (IDUs) in two cities, Philadelphia and San Francisco, that span a strategic range of the demographic, economic, political, and cultural factors affecting inner-city poverty in the United States. Building on long-term, continuous participant-observation ethnographic fieldwork in the shooting encampments of ethnically and generationally bounded social networks of heroin injectors and crack smokers in San Francisco as well as pilot research in Philadelphia at open-air drug markets and shooting galleries, we will document patterns of: 1) law enforcement and criminal justice; 2) poverty and income generating opportunities (including legal and illegal labor markets and public subsidies); 3) illegal drug markets and polydrug availability; 4) racialized ethnic boundaries and conflicts; 5) gender/sexuality boundaries that delimit social networks; 6) oppositional sub-cultural identities that trap IDUs into counterproductive relationships with the services that are meant to help or contain them; 7) violence and insecurity; 8) access to clinical care, public health prevention messages, and social services; 9) access to ecological and basic survival needs infrastructures including transportation systems, food, and shelter from inclement weather. An experienced ethnographic team in both cities will collect data on individual-level HIV risk behaviors at fieldsites that we have successfully maintained on the parent grant for more than 12 years in San Francisco and recently established in Philadelphia (core N of each network=15-20 at any given time, peripheral N=10-15 in each fieldsite; 2 sites in Philadephia and 2 in San Francisco). The project will administer a set of procedures for cross-methodological collaboration with epidemiologists who are the Principal Investigators on long-term, large quantitative data sets documenting street-based drug users in both cities. This will enable us to examine the representativity of our ethnographic data on individual street-based drug users and to explore the generalizability of our analysis of the larger social structural processes that promote or constrain risky injection and sexual practices. It will also bring one of the largest and oldest NIDA-funded data sets on IDUs in San Francisco, an exceptionally high-tech, wealthy, culturally diverse, and liberal city into an illustrative contrast and dialogue with another large NIDA-supported quantitative data set of street-based drug users in the city of Philadelphia, one of the nation's poorest deindustrialized metropolises, with a declining population of largely native-born white, Latino (primarily Puerto Rican) and African American ethnic groups.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Untangling the complex web of factors that render inner city poverty environments exceptionally risky for HIV infection and addiction will help public health outreach workers and clinicians develop more innovative structural and targeted interventions to reach larger numbers of low income high-risk populations with more effective and convincing messages. Upstream interventions that alter neighborhood-level risk environments can cost-effectively encourage drug users to change their behaviors for pragmatic reasons without necessarily requiring a conscious or willful choice. Our findings will also identify strategic institutions and programs that often operate at cross purposes or fail to coordinate with public health HIV risk reduction priorities (including law enforcement, criminal justice, employment training, public housing, food kitchens, shelters, schools, and churches) but which represent productive sites for multi-service HIV prevention interventions.

"Drug Abuse, Incarceration & Health Disparities in HIV/AIDS: A Longitudinal Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to address how disproportionate confinement of racial/ethnic minorities-especially African Americans-affects health disparities in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. African Americans comprise only 13% of the general population, but about 40% of incarcerated youth and adults and 50% of new cases of HIV/AIDS. Yet, large multisite national longitudinal studies of HIV/AIDS focus on high- risk samples such as men who have sex with men (MACS), women infected with HIV and other ""at-risk"" females (WIHS), and infected women and their infants (WITS). These studies do not include adolescents, do not sample correctional populations, and do not examine the effect of incarceration on HIV/AIDS. Most studies of incarcerated populations are cross-sectional and provide limited information on the effects of incarceration. To continue to address this key omission in the literature, we propose to extend the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a longitudinal study of 1829 juvenile justice youth, enrolled at age 10-18 years (1172 males, 657 females; 1005 African Americans, 296 non-Hispanic whites, 524 Hispanics, and 4 ""other"" race/ethnicity). Currently, the HIV/AIDS component of the project (RO1 DA022953) includes only a subsample (n=743) and 10-, 11-, 12-, and 13-year follow-up interviews. We now propose to (1) study the entire sample (originally 1829, now 1678); (2) conduct 3 additional annual interviews (14-, 15-, and 16-year follow-ups), at which time participants will be aged 26-34 years; (3) collect official records to cross-validate self-reported data (on STI status, arrests, incarceration history, and services received); (4) test the entire sample for HIV infection, chlamydia, and gonorrhea; and (5) administer a new module on incarceration, release, and re-entry. Participants are re-interviewed whether they are re-incarcerated or back in the community. Using data collected in prior phases and the additional interviews, we will examine patterns of drug use, drug use disorder, HIV/AIDS risk and infection from adolescence (ages 10-17 years) to emerging adulthood (ages 18-24 years) and young adulthood (age 25 and older). Our Specific Aims focus on how incarceration, release, and re-entry (e.g., age[s] incarcerated, number of incarcerations, length of incarcerations, amount of time spent in the community between incarcerations) affect the following: (1) drug use behaviors (including the number and types of substances used, frequency of use, and route of administration) and drug use disorders (onset, persistence, desistance, and recurrence); (2) HIV/AIDS sex risk behaviors (including unprotected anal or vaginal receptive sex and trading sex for drugs) and injection-risk behaviors; (3) prevalence and incidence of HIV infection and other STIs; (4) the relationship between patterns of drug use and disorder and HIV/AIDS risk behaviors, especially how risk and protective factors predict, moderate, and mediate these relationships. This study responds to the initiatives of NIDA, NIAAA, and other NIH institutes to reduce health disparities in HIV/AIDS in minority populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial/ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately from the HIV/AIDS epidemic and are disproportionately incarcerated. To address health disparities in HIV/AIDS, we must study correctional populations, which increased from nearly 1.8 million in 1997 to over 2.2 million by mid-year 2006. The proposed study will guide public health policy by investigating how incarceration affects the development of substance use and disorder and HIV/AIDS; identifying risk and protective factors that are potentially malleable; identifying points of intervention during key developmental periods; and extending current conceptual models to include incarceration, release, and reentry.","Drug Abuse,

"Community Vulnerability and Responses to Drug-User-Related HIV/AIDS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing continuation application for the Community Vulnerability and Responses to Drug-User- Related HIV/AIDS study of why large US metropolitan areas vary over time in their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS among drug users and in their responses-i.e., in policies and programs that may affect the epidemic. Drug use and HIV epidemics change over time. In the last funding period, we showed that HIV prevalence in the 96 largest US metropolitan areas declined among injection drug users (IDUs) from 1992 to 2002, and that the population prevalence of IDUs declined in these areas from 1992 to 2000, but then began to rise again. We also showed that metropolitan areas varied in these trajectories, and that a variety of social and policy forces shaped IDU prevalence, racial disparities in IDU prevalence, HIV prevalence among IDUs, racial disparities in AIDS prevalence among IDUs, drug abuse treatment coverage, and syringe exchange access and coverage. Ominously, our recent analyses indicate that the prevalence of IDUs among youth (aged 15 - 29) has begun to rise. Further, as others have shown, HIV has spread widely among NIDUs (non-injecting users of heroin, cocaine, crack, amphetamines or methamphetamine) in some metropolitan areas. These changes are occurring against the backdrop of an economy that has recently shifted from slow to rapid decline, a shift that will lead to great difficulty in maintaining, let alone expanding, services for drug users. Therefore, the Specific Aims of this proposed continuation are: 1. To describe trends, in the 96 largest US metropolitan areas from 1992 - 2012, in (a) critical epidemiologic outcomes (population prevalence of IDUs and NIDUs, and particularly their prevalence among youth; and, among IDUs, HIV prevalence, late-diagnosis HIV cases, and AIDS incidence and mortality) as well as in (b) the implementation of evidence-based drug- related interventions (drug abuse treatment, syringe exchange, HIV counseling and testing) and (c) non- evidence-based drug-related interventions (incarceration and arrests of drug users). 2. To understand how macro-social contexts (e.g., economic changes, social integration, racial residential segregation) and epidemiologic need affect interventions; how interventions and macro-social contexts together affect epidemiologic contexts; how some interventions (e.g., arrests, incarceration) affect others (e.g., syringe exchange coverage); and how some epidemiologic outcomes (e.g., prevalence of young IDUs) affect others (e.g., HIV prevalence). 3. To develop an integrated theory, using agent based modeling, of how these processes interact and thus what the impacts of various intervention mixes are likely to be in given social contexts. 4. To disseminate estimates, results and theoretical understandings to public health agencies and continue to advise them on how they might respond.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will estimate changes in injection and non-injection drug use, in HIV, AIDS and AIDS mortality rates among injection drug users, and in drug- and HIV-related interventions among drug users, in 96 large metropolitan areas over a 21-year period (1992 - 2012). We will investigate how these epidemics and interventions affect one another, and how macro-contextual factors like economic and social conditions shape them both.

"Stress and Drug Use Vulnerability in the African American Community     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The impacts that drug addictions have on health disparities that adversely affect African Americans are grossly understudied. While there is strong evidence linking drug abuse to poor health and problem behaviors in the African American community, the progression of drug abuse is inconsistent (i.e., relatively late initiation and heavy use in the 30s) with national norms and remains unclear. Exposure to chronic stress and the subsequent activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been connected to drug addictions and poor health outcomes. This association is of particular importance since residents in these communities are exposed to many of the risk factors associated with the onset of drug abuse: familial risk, deprived social environment, unemployment, substandard education, low-to-no socioeconomic status, and enduring exposure to experiences of racism and discrimination. Repeated exposure to environmental stressors will lead to 'wear-and-tear' on the body's regulatory system and have profound implications on HPA functioning and the subsequent risk of developing an addiction. This study will pursue three primary aims: (1) Investigate HPA reactivity to acute stress as a predictor of current drug use severity. (2) Investigate trajectories of HPA regulation (level and circadian rhythm) as a predicto of drug use vulnerability across time. (3) Investigate delay discounting as a moderator between trajectories of HPA regulation and drug use vulnerability across time. This study will enroll 350 African American adults (ages 18-21) who reside in the southeastern U.S. and utilize a prospective longitudinal research design that consists of a laboratory assessment involving the Trier Social Stress Test, three in-home assessments that include clinical interviews and behavioral tasks, and six internet assessments that track drug use and related risk factors across a 2-year period. Primary independent variables include environmental stressors, stress-related biomarkers (i.e., salivary cortical, salivary DHEA, heart rate variability, and galvanic skn resistance), and delay discounting. Primary dependent variables include drug use, severity of drug use disorders, and drug use consequences. This study is highly innovative for three primary reasons: (1) A longitudinal research design will be used for the first time to investigate trajectories of HPA regulation as a predictor of drug use vulnerability; (2) The use of multiple indicators of the stress regulatory system, clinical interviews, and a novel behavioral task provides a more nuanced understanding of the research aims; and (3) This study focuses on an understudied population that suffers from drug-related health disparities, but are rarely included in cutting edge laboratory research. It is envisioned that this approach will uncover latent-curve trajectories of stress deregulation as a predictor of drug use vulnerability in this population. Findings from this study will identify causal mechanisms of drug addictions that will advance theory, research, prevention, and treatments aimed at addressing this growing public health problem.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of drug abuse in the African American community is often characterized by oversimplified models that are rooted in research studies that rarely include African Americans. This study will identify mechanisms that influence drug use vulnerability in at-risk African American adults who reside in the southeastern U.S. Such research is needed to develop socially and culturally informed prevention and treatment programs aimed at reducing drug-related health disparities that continue to plague African Americans.            ",Stress and Drug Use Vulnerability in

"Couple HIV prevention for drug-involved male offenders: An Effectiveness Trial     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study responds to PA-09-236 entitled ""HIV/AIDS, Drug Use, and Vulnerable Populations."" This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will rigorously evaluate the implementation, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a couple-based integrated HIV/STI and drug abuse prevention intervention (Connect II) with drug-involved male offenders charged with misdemeanors and their primary female sexual partners, implemented by frontline providers in Criminal Court, Community Court or Probation (CCP) sites in the Bronx, NY, compared to CCP standard treatment of care services (TAU). The primary outcomes are biologically confirmed sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and self-reported condom use. This study will yield important data on implementation factors associated with effectiveness of the proposed intervention in real world resource-constrained criminal justice settings. The proposed CCP study sites are located in the South Bronx, the poorest Congressional District in the U.S. with 96% of residents identifying as Black or Latino. The South Bronx has an HIV prevalence rate of 2.6%. Research has found that 12% of men on probation in New York City are HIV positive. Though the criminal justice system is recognized as the epicenter of the epidemic in the U.S., few, if any, HIV prevention interventions have been developed for the huge number of male offenders under community supervision who represent 90% of the corrections population. No HIV/STI prevention services are currently provided at the proposed CCP sites. The proposed intervention is designed to address this critical gap in services. Connect II was found to be efficacious among drug-involved couples in reducing risky drug and sexual behaviors and drug use. In the proposed study we aim to advance the knowledge of implementation science by testing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Connect II delivered by frontline providers in the real world settings of CCP sites with 240 drug-involved male offenders and their female partners (N=480 participants). Eligible couples will be randomly assigned to either (1) a 4-session Connect II delivered to both partners together + TAU delivered to male participant alone, or (2) a TAU control condition delivered to the male participant. Repeated assessments will occur at baseline and 3, 6, and 12-months post intervention. The study will be conducted by Dr. Nabila El-Bassel, Dr. Louisa Gilbert, and an investigative team from Columbia University in collaboration with Michael Rempel from the Center for Court Innovation and the New York City Department of Probation. If found to be effective, Connect II may be scaled up in community criminal justice settings nationwide to curb the spread of HIV/STIs and to reduce HIV disparities in heavily impacted communities like the South Bronx.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This study addresses the significant public health threat of HIV and other STIs among drug- involved male offenders under community supervision and their female partners. This study will evaluate the implementation, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a brief couple-based HIV and drug abuse prevention intervention for drug-involved male offenders and their female partners delivered by frontline providers in Criminal/Community Court and Probation sites in the South Bronx, the poorest congressional district in the U.S. If found to be effective, the proposed brief intervention may be scaled up to community criminal justice sites nationwide to curb the spread of HIV/STIs and reduce HIV disparities.                    ",Couple HIV prevention for drug-involved male offenders: An Effectiveness Trial,8517073,R01DA033168,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Charge ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Couples ', ' Drug Utilization ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Institutes ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' New York City ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Latino ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' court ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' Consult ', ' Services ', ' professor ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' recidivism ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' probation ', ' criminal offender ', ' offender ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' prevent drug use ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' post intervention ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' efficacy research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' probationer ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' demographics ', ' implementation science ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' ']",NIDA,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2013,648645,0.06416710644856985
"Drug and HIV Risk Among Latino Immigrant Day Laborers in Baltimore     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latino immigrant day laborers (LIDLs) are at heightened risk for drug abuse and dependence as a result of their unique social, situational and contextual circumstances. Low rates of access and utilization of drug treatment and health services and the high mobility of this primarily single and undocumented male population is of great  public health relevance due to their potential to act as a ""bridge for infection"" in the spred of HIV and other blood borne pathogens within the Latino community. Yet data regarding the characteristics of this hard-to-reach population and their involvement in drug and sexual risk behavior is sparse. Even less is known about the experiences of LIDLs that settle in ""new settlement destinations"" or areas without a prior presence of a Latino community. For LIDLs who migrate to new settlement cities, exposure to risk factors may be even higher due to lack of family and conventional sex partners. The emphasis of this study is on how the context of a new immigrant settlement as well as individual and migration factors impact the drug use patterns of three groups of LIDLs: premigration drug initiators (current drug users who initiated use before migration), postmigration drug initiators (current drug users who initiated use in the U.S.) and non-drug users (no drug use in the last year). Comparing patterns of use between these three groups will identify distinct risk and protective factors that have implications for use as interventional components. Baltimore is an optimal context to examine drug initiation and use among LIDLs as Latinos represent the fastest growing ethnic group in the city and have experienced nearly doubling of HIV/AIDS incidence in the last decade. Using social ecology theory, this social epidemiological study will identify, recruit and interview 75 LIDLs. Respondents will be recruited from identified day labor sites in Baltimore. Using an ethnographic methodological approach, an adaptive sampling methodology will be implemented with elements of field intensive outreach, Rapid Assessment for Response and Evaluation, and targeted snowball sampling. Data will be collected from three groups of LIDLs: premigration drug initiators (n=25); postmigration drug initiators (n=25); and, non-drug users (n=25) (no drug use in the last year). Findings regarding the diffusion of HIV-related risks as well as drug practices may challenge traditional modes of treatment and shift clinical practice paradigms by indicating important points for prevention and intervention with this understudied population. To further understand these drug use patterns and adverse health behaviors, this study will: 1.Characterize qualitatively the drug use (initiation, patterns and practices) and drug and sexual risk behaviors among male LIDLs in Baltimore; 2. Identify and provide a detailed qualitative description of risk and protective factors associated with individual characteristics (background characteristics, perceived discrimination, acculturative stress) and migration factors among male LIDLs in Baltimore; 3. Document the unique contextual factors within a new immigrant settlement community that contribute to the emergence of adverse health related drug and sexual risk behavior.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health significance of this proposed research lies in the target population - the potential of Latino immigrant day laborers to act as a ""bridge for infection"" in the spread of HIV and other blood-borne pathogens within the Latino community, including non-drug using populations.

"Comparative Effectiveness Research Diffusion and Mental Health Care Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) compares benefits and risks of different treatments. However, little is known about the impact of large-scale CER implementation as conceived in the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) on equity in health care across racial/ethnic groups. Identifying the influence of FDA risk warnings on disparities in psychotropic drug use provides a platform to understand how CER will influence disparities in certain situations. Disparity methods have typically not taken into account specific recommendations and warnings on effectiveness and safety. With the advent of the ACA and continued concern over persistent disparities, it is imperative that disparities research continues to evolve to incorporate lessons learned from CER.  We capitalize upon time trends in warnings and advisories to understand disparities in diffusion with the intention of identifying policies tht might avert the negative equity consequences of incorporating CER into routine practice. Specifically, we 1) Track changes in antidepressant use among youth and antipsychotic drug use among youth and adults by racial/ethnic group as they are influenced by CER-generated risk warnings and advisories; 2) Assess whether specific information in FDA warnings influenced disparity trends in a) treatments recommended by CER-generated evidence (e.g., fluoxetine use and metabolic screening for antipsychotic users); and b) psychotropic drug use that is potentially harmful (e.g., olanzapine use); and 3) Identify how provider characteristics an HMO enrollment act as mechanisms that underlie the differential diffusion of CER via health risk warnings.  We implement the Institute of Medicine (IOM) definition of healthcare disparities in order to capture trends in disparities over time, overlaying timelines of warnings and recommendations related to antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs. We adapt IOM methods by decomposing disparities in overall drug use into disparities in specific categories of use mentioned by FDA warnings as carrying particular risk or benefit. If we find racial/ethnic disparities in diffusion of risk warnings and advisories, this suggests policymakers should focus on improving uptake of CER among minorities. If we identify that certain providers and HMO membership influences disparities in diffusion, this will lead to recommendations for policymakers of actionable policies to avert the negative equity consequences of incorporating CER into routine practice.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this proposed project, we intend to examine whether specific information in FDA warnings influenced disparity trends in psychotropic drug use and mental health care and to identify how provider characteristics and HMO enrollment act as mechanisms that underlie the differential diffusion of CER via health risk warnings. Identifying the influence of FDA risk warnings on trends in psychotropic drug use and related health care provides a platform to understand how CER will influence disparities and will help us to assess whether information regarding the risks and benefits of medications are being equitably disseminated. Our examination of how an increased reliance on CER will likely influence disparities in treatment after health care reform will provide policymakers with actionable information that might avert the negative equity consequences of incorporating CER into routine practice.            ",Comparative Effectiveness Research Diffusion and Mental Health Care Disparities,8578898,R01HS021486,[''],AHRQ,CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE,R01,2013,228715,0.13187221068872973
"Phase 2 Study of Hemin for Treatment and Prevention of Porphyria Attacks  PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY Hemin for injection (Panhematin"", Lundbeck) was the first drug approved under the Orphan Drug Act. Its approval in 1971 for the amelioration of acute attacks of acute intermittent porphyria was based on published reports of biochemical efficacy and evident benefit in numerous individual cases and case series rather than adequately powered, randomized, controlled studies. Therefore its efficacy has remained in question especially in an era of evidence-based medicine. Moreover, the narrow approved indications (only women with cyclic attacks), a requirement for an initial trial of glucose loading, a wide dose range of 1-4 mg/kg, and a method for reconstitution of the lyophilized product with sterile water have impaired its clinical usefullness. It is increasingly recognized that additional clinical studies are needed to address these longstanding issues and considerable disparities between product labeling and current expert recommendations. A Phase 2 study to be conducted by at least 5 centers in the Porphyrias Consortium (supported by NIDDK and part of the NIH Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network - RDCRN) aims to improve the evidence base for this treatment for acute porphyric attacks. This randomized, blinded placebo-controlled study will compare treatment with Panhematin"" 4 mg/kg daily plus glucose for 4 days to treatment with glucose alone in 30-40 patients with acute attacks of porphyria. The consortium investigators have experience in conducting controlled studies in porphyrias, including studies in patients with acute attacks. The RDCRN supports development of study materials, web-based data entry, data warehousing, and monitoring at multiple study sites, and has established a data and safety monitoring board. The manufacturer has committed drug for the study. The American Porphyria Foundation, a longstanding and effective patient support group that is also part of the Consortium, will assist with patient recruitment. Infrastructure at all sites will include facilities of NIH-funded Clinical and Translational Science Awards. An investigator IND application (IND#13,929) has been approved. An analgous study is being developed to assess the use of Panhematin"" for prevention of porphyric attacks, since there is even less evidence for this use of the drug.

"Navigator Enhanced Case Management for Jail Inmates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year, there are over 600 unduplicated HIV-infected persons incarcerated in the San Francisco jail and almost two-thirds released with HIV-focused discharge planning were reincarcerated within 1 year. More than half of HIV-infected jail inmates are diagnosed with mental health conditions severe enough to require medication and a similar proportion report substance abuse disorders at the time of detention. While some community-based services exist, there remains a critical need exists to improve linkages to care and adherence to care plans for HIV-infected adults as they move between community and jai. An effective service delivery model used in similar high-needs populations exists, but has not been tested with HIV-infected drug users leaving jails - Navigator case management. Base on harm reduction, motivational interviewing and general social work principles, this model uses assertive community treatment and a highly proactive approach to facilitate adherence to a comprehensive care plan designed to address a client's multiple needs. Case managers work with paraprofessional peer navigators to help clients make better use of available resources, more effectively communicate with providers, sustain care over time and successfully connect with multiple service provider sectors. In this study, we propose to tailor this approach to meet the needs of HIV-infected individuals with substance abuse and mental health issues, pilot test the intervention and assessment procedures and then conduct a randomized study in which 360 HIV-infected men and women leaving jail. Specifically, participants will receive either Navigator case management delivered by the non-profit San Francisco Pre-Trial Diversion project or the standard of care currently provided to transitioning inmates, 90- days of as-needed case management provided by the San Francisco Department of Public Health's Forensic AIDS Project. We will test the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing sexual and drug-related HIV transmission risk, increasing HIV medication adherence, reducing drug dependence and reducing reincarceration. Finally, we will characterize both the Navigator and Forensic AIDS Project intervention processes and conduct exploratory analyses of the mediators of HIV transmission risk and risk reduction and HIV-related adherence among HIV+ individuals leaving jail. Our study is highly innovative because no interventions exist that are proven effective with this population - HIV-infected individuals with drug use and mental health issues. This study will also contribute to the field of HIV prevention by incorporating risk reduction counseling alongside more traditional case management support services.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-infected adults incarcerated in the United States criminal justice system are predominantly active drug users and disproportionately people of color. The complex interplay of poverty, race, lack of education and sanctions--rather than treatment--for addictions reinforces returns to the criminal justice system and pervasive health disparities for HIV-infected individuals. Underlying behaviors that lead to repeated incarceration closely correlate with behaviors that are associated with HIV transmission and increased morbidity and mortality from HIV. In drug addicted adults, recidivism is driven by drug relapse and illegal activities associated with drug use, failure to engage and remain in mental health treatment or failure to break free from social instability in the form of homelessness and joblessness. This study proposes to assess whether a method of case management proven effective for similar populations can ensuring services to successfully and permanently break the cycle of incarceration, drug abuse and HIV transmission risk behavior among HIV-infected individuals leaving jail.

"Factors for enhanced neurotoxicity in methamphetamine abuse in HIV infection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted in response to PAR-09-011 Diversity-promoting Institutions Drug Abuse Research Program (DIDARP) requested by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). This proposed research program is timely since it focuses on two ofthe major health disparity issues in Hawaii, namely, methamphetamine abuse and HIV infection. Recent surveys indicate that Native Hawaiians or other Pacific islanders have the highest rate of methamphetamine use among persons aged 12 or older in the United States. Although HIV/AIDS infection rate is relatively low in Hawaii compared to other major metropolis, the rates are increasing among Hawaiians. This DIDARP will include two primary and one pilot research projects that will focus on mechanisms and factors that might enhance neurotoxicity associated with methamphetamine of HIV. We aim to enhance the capacity for drug abuse research at UH by creating this small translational research team. This group will take advantage and build on the expertise of the few but outstanding existing clinical drug abuse and HIV researchers and basic scientists. We aim to enable UH to develop a strong clinical and translational drug abuse research program. To complement these projects, we additionally propose training and career development activities that wil offer exciting opportunities for DIDARP investigators and others at UH through the Administrative and Training Core. The Faculty in the Core will provide guidance and mentorship for these junior faculty and graduate students, through infrastructure support, educational courses, seminars, and a dedicated DIDARP website, We have obtained institutional support for two additional graduate students for the program. We also have recruited 4 distinguished External Advisory Committee members with expertise related to the proposed research; each has enthusiastically agreed to provide their advice and letter of support for the development of this DIDARP at UH.

"Social Networks and HIV Risk Behaviors of Special Populations of Drug Users     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this resubmitted K02 application is to further develop Dr. Carrie Oser's productive independent research career and to augment her research focus on HIV, substance abuse treatment, crime, and health disparities by gaining new training on social networks and HIV intervention development. The K02 builds upon her focus on special populations, including both rural drug users and African American drug users. The proposed training goals will provide new instruction in social networks, HIV intervention development, and the responsible conduct of research. The specific aims are: (1) to identify HIV and HCV risk and longitudinal changes in risk in the social networks of 503 rural out-of-treatment drug using women, as compared to men; and (2) to examine the effect of social networks, including structure (e.g., size, density), function (e.g., emotional and instrument support), and content (e.g., attitudes towards physicians), on HIV and HCV risk behaviors and health services utilization among African American drug using women, as compared to men, across criminal justice status. This significant and innovative study will have strong public healt impacts and will support NIDA's Health Disparities Initiative because of its potential to contribut to our understanding of the cultural and social network correlates of health disparities among both rural and African American drug users. In addition, this study improves upon the methodological limitations of previous research findings by examining various social networks (e.g., egocentric, dyadic, and sociocentric) and using longitudinal data in multilevel models. This proposed project will allow for a practical application of the substantive knowledge and analytical skills acquired from the K02 training activities and will ultimately culminate in the development of forthcoming investigator initiated NIDA grant applications. Specifically, these findings will be used as a foundation for future HIV social networks based intervention to increase special populations' use of preventative health care and subsequently reduce the need for expensive medical services, as well as to decrease HIV risk behaviors including drug use, unprotected sex, and recidivism.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is significant to the public health field because of its potential to understand the individual, cultural, and social network factors associated with HI and HCV risk behaviors among two special populations - rural drug users and African American drug users. These findings will be used as a foundation for developing social network based HIV interventions to increase special populations' use of preventative health care and subsequently reduce the need for expensive medical services, as well as to decrease HIV risk behaviors including drug use, unprotected sex, and recidivism.                ",Social Networks and HIV Risk Behaviors of Special Populations of Drug Users,8599228,K02DA035116,"['Accounting ', ' Attitude ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Data Collection ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Kentucky ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Roxicodone ', ' Oxycontin ', ' Oxycodone SR ', ' Oxycodeinon ', ' Morphinan-6-one, 4,5-epoxy-14-hydroxy-3-methoxy-17-methyl-, (5alpha)- ', ' Dihydrohydroxycodeinone ', ' Oxycodone ', ' Physicians ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Prisons ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Training Activity ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Social Network ', ' career ', ' density ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' HCV ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' Training ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Spirituality ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Rural ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Drug user ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' SNAP ', ' S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Special Population ', ' named group ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' recidivism ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' probation ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Emotional ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' K02 Award ', ' Independent Scientist Award ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' Instruction ', ' willingness ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' application in practice ', ' practical application ', ' Network-based ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' injection drug use ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,K02,2013,115827,0.1196814521075345
"Brief intervention for drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV/HCV     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this study is to reduce risk behaviors and increase health and behavioral health service utilization among disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV and HCV. This project has potential to make a significant contribution to science by advancing knowledge about the health disparities, high-risk behaviors (injection drug use, sex risk), and service utilization of this high-risk, vulnerable, an understudied group of women during a time of emerging and significant public health risk in an Appalachian rural setting. This project will incorporate standardized screening (NIDA-modified ASSIST) to identify high-risk rural women drug users from jails, including injectors. Consenting women (N=350) will be asked to participate in a baseline interview, and will then be randomly assigned to one of two study groups: (1) HIV Education (HIV- Ed n=175) which includes the NIDA standard pre and post-test counseling, HIV and HCV rapid testing, and an information packet on existing community drug abuse and HIV/HCV resources; or (2) Motivational Interviewing- based HIV Risk Reduction (MI-HIV n=175) which, in addition to what is received in the HIV-Ed group, also includes an evidence-based brief intervention for high-risk women focused on an individualized plan for enhancing motivation to reduce risk behaviors and to use health and behavioral health services in the community. Specific aims include: (1) to compare the effectiveness of an evidence-based HIV risk reduction intervention (MI-HIV) to HIV Education (NIDA Standard) in reducing sex risk behaviors, injection practices, and drug use among a culturally unique sample of disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV and HCV; and (2) to examine MI-HIV Intervention engagement as a predictor of community health and behavioral health service utilization (including drug treatment and mental health) at follow-up among disadvantaged, drug- using rural women at high risk for HIV and HCV. This project is innovative because it 1) targets a high-risk and understudied group of women, 2) uses brief intervention to not only reduce risk behavior but also to enhance motivation for using community health and behavioral health resources, and 3) utilizes a real-world setting to identify high-risk women drug users. The long-term goal of this study is to increase access to health and behavioral health services in order to improve the quality of health of high-risk rural women.          The overall aim of this study is to reduce risk behaviors and increase health and behavioral health service utilization among disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high risk for HIV and HCV. This project has potential to make a significant contribution to science by providing knowledge about the health, risk behaviors, and service utilization of a vulnerable and understudied group of women during a time of emerging and significant public health risk in a rural Appalachian setting. Successful completion of the aims of this project will advance the delivery of a low-cost, potentially high impact intervention with implications for a number of other real world settings (such as criminal justice venues) where other disadvantaged high-risk drug users can be identified and targeted for intervention.

"Couple HIV prevention for drug-involved male offenders: An Effectiveness Trial     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study responds to PA-09-236 entitled ""HIV/AIDS, Drug Use, and Vulnerable Populations."" This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will rigorously evaluate the implementation, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a couple-based integrated HIV/STI and drug abuse prevention intervention (Connect II) with drug-involved male offenders charged with misdemeanors and their primary female sexual partners, implemented by frontline providers in Criminal Court, Community Court or Probation (CCP) sites in the Bronx, NY, compared to CCP standard treatment of care services (TAU). The primary outcomes are biologically confirmed sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and self-reported condom use. This study will yield important data on implementation factors associated with effectiveness of the proposed intervention in real world resource-constrained criminal justice settings. The proposed CCP study sites are located in the South Bronx, the poorest Congressional District in the U.S. with 96% of residents identifying as Black or Latino. The South Bronx has an HIV prevalence rate of 2.6%. Research has found that 12% of men on probation in New York City are HIV positive. Though the criminal justice system is recognized as the epicenter of the epidemic in the U.S., few, if any, HIV prevention interventions have been developed for the huge number of male offenders under community supervision who represent 90% of the corrections population. No HIV/STI prevention services are currently provided at the proposed CCP sites. The proposed intervention is designed to address this critical gap in services. Connect II was found to be efficacious among drug-involved couples in reducing risky drug and sexual behaviors and drug use. In the proposed study we aim to advance the knowledge of implementation science by testing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Connect II delivered by frontline providers in the real world settings of CCP sites with 240 drug-involved male offenders and their female partners (N=480 participants). Eligible couples will be randomly assigned to either (1) a 4-session Connect II delivered to both partners together + TAU delivered to male participant alone, or (2) a TAU control condition delivered to the male participant. Repeated assessments will occur at baseline and 3, 6, and 12-months post intervention. The study will be conducted by Dr. Nabila El-Bassel, Dr. Louisa Gilbert, and an investigative team from Columbia University in collaboration with Michael Rempel from the Center for Court Innovation and the New York City Department of Probation. If found to be effective, Connect II may be scaled up in community criminal justice settings nationwide to curb the spread of HIV/STIs and to reduce HIV disparities in heavily impacted communities like the South Bronx.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This study addresses the significant public health threat of HIV and other STIs among drug- involved male offenders under community supervision and their female partners.

"Drug Abuse, Incarceration & Health Disparities in HIV/AIDS: A Longitudinal Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to address how disproportionate confinement of racial/ethnic minorities-especially African Americans-affects health disparities in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. African Americans comprise only 13% of the general population, but about 40% of incarcerated youth and adults and 50% of new cases of HIV/AIDS. Yet, large multisite national longitudinal studies of HIV/AIDS focus on high- risk samples such as men who have sex with men (MACS), women infected with HIV and other ""at-risk"" females (WIHS), and infected women and their infants (WITS). These studies do not include adolescents, do not sample correctional populations, and do not examine the effect of incarceration on HIV/AIDS. Most studies of incarcerated populations are cross-sectional and provide limited information on the effects of incarceration. To continue to address this key omission in the literature, we propose to extend the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a longitudinal study of 1829 juvenile justice youth, enrolled at age 10-18 years (1172 males, 657 females; 1005 African Americans, 296 non-Hispanic whites, 524 Hispanics, and 4 ""other"" race/ethnicity). Currently, the HIV/AIDS component of the project (RO1 DA022953) includes only a subsample (n=743) and 10-, 11-, 12-, and 13-year follow-up interviews. We now propose to (1) study the entire sample (originally 1829, now 1678); (2) conduct 3 additional annual interviews (14-, 15-, and 16-year follow-ups), at which time participants will be aged 26-34 years; (3) collect official records to cross-validate self-reported data (on STI status, arrests, incarceration history, and services received); (4) test the entire sample for HIV infection, chlamydia, and gonorrhea; and (5) administer a new module on incarceration, release, and re-entry. Participants are re-interviewed whether they are re-incarcerated or back in the community. Using data collected in prior phases and the additional interviews, we will examine patterns of drug use, drug use disorder, HIV/AIDS risk and infection from adolescence (ages 10-17 years) to emerging adulthood (ages 18-24 years) and young adulthood (age 25 and older). Our Specific Aims focus on how incarceration, release, and re-entry (e.g., age[s] incarcerated, number of incarcerations, length of incarcerations, amount of time spent in the community between incarcerations) affect the following: (1) drug use behaviors (including the number and types of substances used, frequency of use, and route of administration) and drug use disorders (onset, persistence, desistance, and recurrence); (2) HIV/AIDS sex risk behaviors (including unprotected anal or vaginal receptive sex and trading sex for drugs) and injection-risk behaviors; (3) prevalence and incidence of HIV infection and other STIs; (4) the relationship between patterns of drug use and disorder and HIV/AIDS risk behaviors, especially how risk and protective factors predict, moderate, and mediate these relationships. This study responds to the initiatives of NIDA, NIAAA, and other NIH institutes to reduce health disparities in HIV/AIDS in minority populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial/ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately from the HIV/AIDS epidemic and are disproportionately incarcerated. To address health disparities in HIV/AIDS, we must study correctional populations, which increased from nearly 1.8 million in 1997 to over 2.2 million by mid-year 2006. The proposed study will guide public health policy by investigating how incarceration affects the development of substance use and disorder and HIV/AIDS; identifying risk and protective factors that are potentially malleable; identifying points of intervention during key developmental periods; and extending current conceptual models to include incarceration, release, and reentry.","Drug Abuse,

"Stress and Drug Use Vulnerability in the African American Community     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The impacts that drug addictions have on health disparities that adversely affect African Americans are grossly understudied. While there is strong evidence linking drug abuse to poor health and problem behaviors in the African American community, the progression of drug abuse is inconsistent (i.e., relatively late initiation and heavy use in the 30s) with national norms and remains unclear. Exposure to chronic stress and the subsequent activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been connected to drug addictions and poor health outcomes. This association is of particular importance since residents in these communities are exposed to many of the risk factors associated with the onset of drug abuse: familial risk, deprived social environment, unemployment, substandard education, low-to-no socioeconomic status, and enduring exposure to experiences of racism and discrimination. Repeated exposure to environmental stressors will lead to 'wear-and-tear' on the body's regulatory system and have profound implications on HPA functioning and the subsequent risk of developing an addiction. This study will pursue three primary aims: (1) Investigate HPA reactivity to acute stress as a predictor of current drug use severity. (2) Investigate trajectories of HPA regulation (level and circadian rhythm) as a predicto of drug use vulnerability across time. (3) Investigate delay discounting as a moderator between trajectories of HPA regulation and drug use vulnerability across time. This study will enroll 350 African American adults (ages 18-21) who reside in the southeastern U.S. and utilize a prospective longitudinal research design that consists of a laboratory assessment involving the Trier Social Stress Test, three in-home assessments that include clinical interviews and behavioral tasks, and six internet assessments that track drug use and related risk factors across a 2-year period. Primary independent variables include environmental stressors, stress-related biomarkers (i.e., salivary cortical, salivary DHEA, heart rate variability, and galvanic skn resistance), and delay discounting. Primary dependent variables include drug use, severity of drug use disorders, and drug use consequences. This study is highly innovative for three primary reasons: (1) A longitudinal research design will be used for the first time to investigate trajectories of HPA regulation as a predictor of drug use vulnerability; (2) The use of multiple indicators of the stress regulatory system, clinical interviews, and a novel behavioral task provides a more nuanced understanding of the research aims; and (3) This study focuses on an understudied population that suffers from drug-related health disparities, but are rarely included in cutting edge laboratory research. It is envisioned that this approach will uncover latent-curve trajectories of stress deregulation as a predictor of drug use vulnerability in this population. Findings from this study will identify causal mechanisms of drug addictions that will advance theory, research, prevention, and treatments aimed at addressing this growing public health problem.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of drug abuse in the African American community is often characterized by oversimplified models that are rooted in research studies that rarely include African Americans. This study will identify mechanisms that influence drug use vulnerability in at-risk African American adults who reside in the southeastern U.S. Such research is needed to develop socially and culturally informed prevention and treatment programs aimed at reducing drug-related health disparities that continue to plague African Americans.            ",Stress and Drug Use Vulnerability in

"African American Offenders: Drug Use, Mental Health and HIV Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The primary goal of this K08 award is to further develop a productive independent research career in drug abuse research. The training and career development plan will enhance Dr. Stevens-Watkins's research experience in primary data collection with prisoners focused on drug use, mental health, and HIV thus resulting in the clarification of the specific aims of an R01 submission in years 4 and 5. The proposed training objectives are: (1) to receive training in the epidemiology of drug abuse, mental health, and HIV as they relate to health disparities among African Americans; (2) to further develop expertise in research with special populations, biostatistics, and advanced quantitative analyses including non-linear, categorical models, and structural equation modeling; (3) to use the data collected in the proposed research plan as pilot data for an R01 research proposal. The specified training goals are aligned with the research aims and compliment the clinical experience of the candidate. Dr. Stevens-Watkins will be sponsored by her established mentors, Drs. Carl Leukefeld and Carrie Oser, both with expertise in drug abuse and HIV research. Of high significance, HIV has recently been termed a ""crisis"" in the African American community. The overall goal of the proposed research plan is to better understand the complex and dynamic relationship between drug use, mental health, and HIV risk among African American male prisoners nearing community re-entry. The specific aims are (1) to explore drug use, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and HIV risk behaviors among African American male inmates by conducting a thorough literature review and devising an analytical model using biostatics multivariate analytic techniques with available data; (2) to identify prevalence, incidence, and predictors of drug use disorders, anxiety, depressive disorders and HIV sexual risk behaviors among 205 incarcerated African American men; (3) to examine the knowledge, patterns, and perceived cultural and community barriers to utilizing individual and health resources and their relationship to substance abuse recovery and HIV risk behaviors among 205 African American men upon release from prison. Baseline data will be collected in prison and follow-up data collection will occur when participants have been released in the community after 3-months. The proposed research plan will offer HIV testing and counseling to an at-risk population that has historically been difficult to engage in research and HIV testing, subsequently significantly impacting public health by possibly preventing the spread of HIV. The candidate's immediate career goals include published manuscripts and R01 funding by the end of K08 funding, with an ultimate career goal of becoming an independent clinical drug abuse researcher. This proposal includes an outstanding mentoring team, as well as a feasible training and research plan utilizing resources offered by both Spalding University and the University of Kentucky.           The proposed project has significant public health implications for reducing the spread of HIV among the African American community by offering testing and by targeting men exiting prison, re-entering the community. The proposed project will generate an improved understanding of the complex relationship between drug use, mental health, and HIV risk among an at-risk group.

"Social Networks and HIV Risk Behaviors of Special Populations of Drug Users     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this resubmitted K02 application is to further develop Dr. Carrie Oser's productive independent research career and to augment her research focus on HIV, substance abuse treatment, crime, and health disparities by gaining new training on social networks and HIV intervention development. The K02 builds upon her focus on special populations, including both rural drug users and African American drug users. The proposed training goals will provide new instruction in social networks, HIV intervention development, and the responsible conduct of research. The specific aims are: (1) to identify HIV and HCV risk and longitudinal changes in risk in the social networks of 503 rural out-of-treatment drug using women, as compared to men; and (2) to examine the effect of social networks, including structure (e.g., size, density), function (e.g., emotional and instrument support), and content (e.g., attitudes towards physicians), on HIV and HCV risk behaviors and health services utilization among African American drug using women, as compared to men, across criminal justice status. This significant and innovative study will have strong public healt impacts and will support NIDA's Health Disparities Initiative because of its potential to contribut to our understanding of the cultural and social network correlates of health disparities among both rural and African American drug users. In addition, this study improves upon the methodological limitations of previous research findings by examining various social networks (e.g., egocentric, dyadic, and sociocentric) and using longitudinal data in multilevel models. This proposed project will allow for a practical application of the substantive knowledge and analytical skills acquired from the K02 training activities and will ultimately culminate in the development of forthcoming investigator initiated NIDA grant applications. Specifically, these findings will be used as a foundation for future HIV social networks based intervention to increase special populations' use of preventative health care and subsequently reduce the need for expensive medical services, as well as to decrease HIV risk behaviors including drug use, unprotected sex, and recidivism.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is significant to the public health field because of its potential to understand the individual, cultural, and social network factors associated with HI and HCV risk behaviors among two special populations - rural drug users and African American drug users.

"The Logics for HIV Risk among Street-Based Heroin Injectors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a theoretically and ethnographically informed model of ""HIV risk environment"" for public health intervention by identifying the key structural forces, institutional processes, and socio-cultural constraints that shape HIV behaviors among inner-city street-based drug users. We will examine the social processes that drive the logics for HIV transmission behaviors among street-based injection drug users (IDUs) in two cities, Philadelphia and San Francisco, that span a strategic range of the demographic, economic, political, and cultural factors affecting inner-city poverty in the United States. Building on long-term, continuous participant-observation ethnographic fieldwork in the shooting encampments of ethnically and generationally bounded social networks of heroin injectors and crack smokers in San Francisco as well as pilot research in Philadelphia at open-air drug markets and shooting galleries, we will document patterns of: 1) law enforcement and criminal justice; 2) poverty and income generating opportunities (including legal and illegal labor markets and public subsidies); 3) illegal drug markets and polydrug availability; 4) racialized ethnic boundaries and conflicts; 5) gender/sexuality boundaries that delimit social networks; 6) oppositional sub-cultural identities that trap IDUs into counterproductive relationships with the services that are meant to help or contain them; 7) violence and insecurity; 8) access to clinical care, public health prevention messages, and social services; 9) access to ecological and basic survival needs infrastructures including transportation systems, food, and shelter from inclement weather. An experienced ethnographic team in both cities will collect data on individual-level HIV risk behaviors at fieldsites that we have successfully maintained on the parent grant for more than 12 years in San Francisco and recently established in Philadelphia (core N of each network=15-20 at any given time, peripheral N=10-15 in each fieldsite; 2 sites in Philadephia and 2 in San Francisco). The project will administer a set of procedures for cross-methodological collaboration with epidemiologists who are the Principal Investigators on long-term, large quantitative data sets documenting street-based drug users in both cities. This will enable us to examine the representativity of our ethnographic data on individual street-based drug users and to explore the generalizability of our analysis of the larger social structural processes that promote or constrain risky injection and sexual practices. It will also bring one of the largest and oldest NIDA-funded data sets on IDUs in San Francisco, an exceptionally high-tech, wealthy, culturally diverse, and liberal city into an illustrative contrast and dialogue with another large NIDA-supported quantitative data set of street-based drug users in the city of Philadelphia, one of the nation's poorest deindustrialized metropolises, with a declining population of largely native-born white, Latino (primarily Puerto Rican) and African American ethnic groups.        Untangling the complex web of factors that render inner city poverty environments exceptionally risky for HIV infection and addiction will help public health outreach workers and clinicians develop more innovative structural and targeted interventions to reach larger numbers of low income high-risk populations with more effective and convincing messages. Upstream interventions that alter neighborhood-level risk environments can cost-effectively encourage drug users to change their behaviors for pragmatic reasons without necessarily requiring a conscious or willful choice. Our findings will also identify strategic institutions and programs that often operate at cross purposes or fail to coordinate with public health HIV risk reduction priorities (including law enforcement, criminal justice, employment training, public housing, food kitchens, shelters, schools, and churches) but which represent productive sites for multi-service HIV prevention interventions.

"Strengthening Hispanic Families via NIDA Prevention Science  This application requests 5 years of K01 support to accelerate the NIDA-focused interdisciplinary research career development of Dr. Ruben Parra-Cardona, a clinician-researcher who seeks to become an independent NIDA prevention researcher committed to underserved Hispanic adolescents and families. His current research evaluates a cultural adaptation of an evidence-based parenting intervention for at-risk Hispanic families with young children (ages 4-11), for which there is potential distal NIDA impact such as reduced risk of starting to smoke tobacco or to use other drugs. Complete evidence on distal benefits of early randomized trial interventions of this type cannot be seen unless the scale of research shifts upward, as in multi-site trials, and unless the measurements include bio-assays to confirm self-report drug use, with probes for potential gene- intervention interactions. Based on the proposed K01 career training objectives, the applicant will acquire the necessary skills to develop an interdisciplinary program of prevention research, informed by epidemiological and biomedical science. During 75% protected time for career development toward independent R01 project leadership, core learning objectives will be met (e.g., RCR, FCOI, grants management). In addition to its core, the training plan has 5 tracks: (1) enhanced mastery of small sample parenting intervention research; (2) enhanced mastery of research design and measurements for larger sample multi-site NIDA prevention research on youth developmental trajectories leading toward NIDA outcomes; (3) enhanced mastery of data analysis for interdependent observations from multiple sites; (4) new learning about integration of biological assays in NIDA family intervention and prevention research via collaborations with expert NIH toxicologists and genetics researchers; (5) mastery of electronic technology complements to current 'in person' intervention delivery and program impact assessment. The proposed award is crucial now that the applicant has become K01-eligible via permanent residency. His college has guaranteed protected time for this K01 career acceleration through structured mentoring program led by a NIDA K05 Senior Scientist, backed by a strong local team of federally funded co-mentors, as well as scientific advisors. Through the proposed K01 award, Dr. Parra-Cardona will gain mastery of the theory and research approaches now being refined by quantitative developmental scientists in new lines of NIDA prevention research.

"Drug Use Among Hispanic Emerging Adults    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among Hispanic adolescents, cultural factors such as acculturation, perceived discrimination, and acculturative stress are risk factors for drug use. Previous studies suggest that the effects of acculturation on drug use may be mediated by family functioning; when adolescents acculturate more rapidly than their parents, the parent- child acculturation discrepancy can lead to breakdowns in family communication and cohesion and increases in family conflict, which in turn can lead to risky behaviors such as drug use among the adolescents. Although there is considerable information about the role of family acculturation patterns in drug use among Hispanic adolescents, we do not know how family acculturation patterns affect adolescents as they transition into the next stage of life, emerging adulthood. Emerging adulthood, a provisional stage in which young adults try out adult roles but may not become firmly entrenched in them, is characterized by identity exploration, residential instability, self-focus, a subjective feeling of being between adolescence and true adulthood, and increased opportunities. In general, individuals who navigate this transition smoothly emerge with a more developed sense of identity, successful interpersonal relationships, new life roles, and minimal levels of substance use. However, the high level of independence and low level of social constraints that occur during emerging adulthood also make this a high-risk period for drug use and other problem behaviors. Understanding how factors in adolescence affect drug use in early adulthood can lead to better intervention efforts for adolescents. More research is needed to determine how cultural factors influence the transition to emerging adulthood among Hispanics and to identify the risk factors for escalation of drug use during this pivotal transition. This continuation application proposes to follow an established cohort of Hispanic adolescents (12th graders in the 2008-2009 school year) for an additional 4 years to identify the predictors of their drug use trajectories during the transition to emerging adulthood. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are the following: (1) Conduct an additional 4 annual surveys of the participants; (2) Construct individual growth curves to describe their use of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs; (3) Identify the predictors of the growth curve parameters, including cultural factors, peer factors, substance use during high school, psychological factors, and demographic factors; (4) Evaluate emerging adulthood variables as potential mediators of these influences, including identity exploration, experimentation / possibilities, instability (residential mobility, role transitions), self-focus, and subjective experience of being in-between adolescence and adulthood; and (5) Make recommendations for the development of improved health education messages to prevent drug use among acculturating Hispanics during the transition to emerging adulthood.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application addresses the public health goals of preventing and reducing substance use among young adults. It also aims to reduce health disparities by identifying risk and protective factors that are specific to Hispanics.

"Factors for enhanced neurotoxicity in methamphetamine abuse in HIV infection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted in response to PAR-09-011 Diversity-promoting Institutions Drug Abuse Research Program (DIDARP) requested by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). This proposed research program is timely since it focuses on two ofthe major health disparity issues in Hawaii, namely, methamphetamine abuse and HIV infection. Recent surveys indicate that Native Hawaiians or other Pacific islanders have the highest rate of methamphetamine use among persons aged 12 or older in the United States. Although HIV/AIDS infection rate is relatively low in Hawaii compared to other major metropolis, the rates are increasing among Hawaiians. This DIDARP will include two primary and one pilot research projects that will focus on mechanisms and factors that might enhance neurotoxicity associated with methamphetamine of HIV. We aim to enhance the capacity for drug abuse research at UH by creating this small translational research team. This group will take advantage and build on the expertise of the few but outstanding existing clinical drug abuse and HIV researchers and basic scientists. We aim to enable UH to develop a strong clinical and translational drug abuse research program. To complement these projects, we additionally propose training and career development activities that wil offer exciting opportunities for DIDARP investigators and others at UH through the Administrative and Training Core. The Faculty in the Core will provide guidance and mentorship for these junior faculty and graduate students, through infrastructure support, educational courses, seminars, and a dedicated DIDARP website, We have obtained institutional support for two additional graduate students for the program. We also have recruited 4 distinguished External Advisory Committee members with expertise related to the proposed research; each has enthusiastically agreed to provide their advice and letter of support for the development of this DIDARP at UH.

"Epidemiology, Prevention and Treatment of HCV in Young Adult Persons who Inject Drugs in non-urban New Mexico ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic in the U.S. is concentrated in people who inject drugs (PWID). Increasing reports of HCV including outbreaks of HCV in young adult PWID in non-urban locales have prompted concerns about an expanding epidemic. Several investigations suggest that that these spikes in HCV infection are linked to sharp increases in prescription opiate use that has been trending in the U.S, and which have resulted in young adults transitioning from prescription opiates to injection use, particularly heroin. Young adult PWID in non-urban areas may be at increased risk of infection, from the combination of high viral infectivity and high prevalence of HCV in injecting groups, together with a lack of knowledge regarding infection routes and effective prevention. New Mexico is one of the states leading recorded increases in HCV in young adults, ranking 2nd in the CDC's Emerging Infections Program (EIP), Hepatitis Surveillance Demonstration Sites project, in 2011 for the number and rate of HCV cases reported. Heroin, prescription opioids, and other drugs are also accounting for this state having one of the highest overdose rates in the country. Between October 2013 and March 2014, the New Mexico Department of Health recorded 211 cases of HCV among young adults in a pilot surveillance study, demonstrating the gravity of the problem. To address the need for prevention, care and treatment services against HCV in this population, we propose epidemiological and service uptake research in two regions of New Mexico where young adult PWID have been impacted by drug use and HCV. We will initiate a prospective cohort study of young adult non-urban PWID who will be recruited and followed in two health regions of New Mexico (the South West and North East) to: (1) gather epidemiologic data on risk behaviors, drug use patterns, injection networks, prevention needs, and health service utilization; (2) to refer young adult PWID to HCV care services, as well as other prevention and treatment opportunities including harm reduction and drug treatment, and assess rates of successful linkage, including the  cascade of care; (3) to examine factors that may contribute to non-treatment, poor adherence, and failure to achieve SVR among young adult PWID with chronic HCV infection; and (4) assess reinfection events among young adult PWID who are treated for HCV and achieve SVR. Our proposal, which we refer to in this application as New Mexico H-TIPS, will also include testing and referrals for HIV and HBV co-infections as well. A collaborative group of public health and clinical specialists linked with a strong prevention and clinical service infrastructure in New Mexico will ensure successful implementation of this research. Results from this proposed research will impact a diverse young population disproportionately at risk for HCV and reduce health disparities in a region highly impacted by drug use and HCV.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed three-year research plan seeks to assess the epidemiology of HCV infection in young adult people who inject drugs (PWID) in non-urban areas of New Mexico. The proposed New Mexico H-TIPS project will study factors that will inform effective and integrated care and prevention models for this high-risk population. We have significant expertise in working with the target population, including recruitment and retention and in identifying HCV infection, which together with a unique infrastructure for preventive and clinical services in New Mexico, including HCV and drug treatment make this proposal highly likely to succeed. This research will contribute significantly to further knowledge of  combination  HCV prevention, and how to impact population prevalence and incidence of HCV in New Mexico and elsewhere.            ","Epidemiology, Prevention and Treatment of HCV in Young Adult Persons who Inject Drugs in non-urban New Mexico",8843617,U18PS004568,[''],NCHHSTP,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,U18,2014,299973,0.0839915446261307
"Southern Ohio Prevents Hepatitis Project (StOPHeP) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to develop an integrated comprehensive approach for detection, prevention, linkage to care and treatment for hepatitis C (HCV) among young adults (18-30 years old) who have a history of injection drug use (people who inject drugs, PWID) and live in 21 non-urban southern Ohio counties. We will accomplish this by collaborating with addiction treatment providers, public health agencies, and syringe exchange programs in the target areas to identify, test, refer and link PWID to prevention and treatment services. The target area includes 21 suburban (large fringe metro, small metro) and rural (micropolitian, non-core) counties in southern Ohio, 18 of which are classified as Appalachian. To develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to address the high prevalence of HCV in southern Ohio, we will 1) identify and describe the demographic characteristics and risk behaviors and injection networks of young non-urban PWID, and test them for HCV, hepatitis B (HBV) and HIV; 2) use Peer Navigators to link young non-urban PWID to addiction treatment programs and to primary care, mental health and specialty treatment (infectious diseases, hepatology), including linkage to health insurance through the Affordable Care Act and expanded Ohio Medicaid; 3) use Peer Navigators to provide education on safe injection practices to prevent hepatitis and HIV; and link PWID to syringe exchange programs as available in target communities; 4) use a closed social networking site (SNS) to provide peer-facilitated support for the uninfected prevention group (Prevention Room) and for the linkage-to-care group for PWID with HBV, HCV and/or HIV infection (Treatment Room); available both online and via smartphone; and 5) perform follow-up assessment and re-testing of study participants for HCV within 12 months of study entry to determine rates of new HCV infection and reinfection after successful treatment. Since the majority of the target counties are in Appalachia, this proposal will address healthcare inequities that are endemic to this region, and will provide data on which to base future public health initiatives to reduce HCV among young non-urban PWID.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Injection drug use (IDU) among young adults in rural areas and the resultant epidemic of chronic hepatitis C has become a significant public health problem, but there are few data about the demographics and risk behaviors of rural IDUs to inform public health policies and practice. The use of Peer Navigators and social media will enable us to provide peer support for isolated individuals and ensure study retention and linkage to care. Moreover, linkage to prevention, drug treatment and medical care including infectious disease care for chronic viral infections  will provide data on the outcomes of these efforts in a rural setting.            ",Southern Ohio Prevents Hepatitis Project (StOPHeP),8842531,U18PS004566,[''],NCHHSTP,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,U18,2014,299859,0.07656359361115665
"Yale Drug Abuse, Addiction, and HIV Research Scholars (Yale-DAHRS)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a critical need to develop a diverse pool of highly trained clinician scholars to foster the development of biomedical, behavioral and clinical research related to drug abuse, addiction, and HIV prevention and treatment in general medical settings. Patients who abuse substances are more likely to be seen in general medical settings such as emergency departments (ED), general medical primary care clinics and inpatient wards, HIV and adolescent health clinics, and women's health centers. These patients often present with a complex array of acute consequences and complications (e.g. intoxication, overdose, withdrawal, trauma and infectious diseases) of substance use as well as chronic conditions such as HIV disease, hepatitis, pulmonary and cardiovascular disease. Objectives: The Yale-Drug Abuse, Addiction, and HIV Research Scholars (DAHRS) program provides a comprehensive three year post-doctorate, interdisciplinary, Mentored Career Development Program to improve drug abuse, addiction, and HIV medical outcomes integrating prevention and treatment in general medical settings including ED, primary care, HIV, adolescent, and women's health clinics. Specifically, Yale-DAHRS will: [Aim 1] Develop clinician scientists with the knowledge, skills, and ability to become independent investigators, generating findings of practical value with significant impact to improve health outcomes of patients with and at risk for drug abuse, addiction, and HIV; [Aim 2] Develop future leaders by providing Scholars with leadership tools and skills and creating individualized programs to ensure success in leading multidisciplinary research teams in studying drug abuse, addiction and HIV, and implementation and integration of research findings into general medical settings; and [Aim 3] Enhance the diversity of drug abuse, addiction, and HIV researchers. Addressing women and minority faculty under representation will enhance the diversity of investigators and research topics, broaden perspectives in setting research priorities, increase clinical trial participation, and expand knowledge. Working synergistically with Yale's established training programs in drug abuse, HIV and clinical investigation, Yale- DAHRS will capitalize on existing academic infrastructure and expertise to ensure success. Unique, features include: (1) An interdisciplinary, diverse faculty of independent researchers in illicit and prescription drug abuse and addiction, tobacco, alcohol, HIV, and medical complexities such as pain and hepatitis C; (2) Synergy with well established, high quality post-doctoral training programs at Yale; (3) The use of clinical informatics for data collection, data management, diagnostic tool development, and information dissemination; and (4) The integration of such diverse fields as public health, informatics, clinical epidemiology, systems engineering and demography with the traditional clinical sciences of internal medicine, emergency medicine, HIV medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry, and psychology; (5) Established clinical research laboratories, including the Yale-New Haven Hospital, a tertiary care center for southern New England and a community hospital for the Greater New Haven Area, serving an ethnically, racially, culturally, and economically diverse population, a Veterans Affairs Medical Center and community treatment centers such as the APT Foundation and Federally Qualified Health Centers; (6) Synergies with established research centers and institutes such as the Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS and the Veterans Aging Cohort on HIV. Career Development Plan: Yale-DAHRS is a three year research training program that will prepare a total of six clinician investigators for careers focusing on drug abuse, addiction, and HIV in general medical settings during its first funding cycle. Scholars will earn the Master in Health Sciences degree, combining rigorous training in research methodology, statistics and design with seminars in topics related to drug abuse, addiction, and HIV content, leadership, grant writing and responsible conduct of research. Candidates will complete published mentored research project(s) and prepare an application for the next career step; i.e. NIH R21, R03, R15, R34 mechanism. The collaboration of the multidisciplinary faculty and the combined robust strengths of two principal investigators from Emergency and Internal Medicine, both with extensive experience mentoring and as independent funded investigators will drive the Yale-DAHRS program. Potential Research Projects: Multiple research projects are ""shovel ready"" for Scholar training and can be completed within our allotted time frame, such as secondary data analysis using national large datasets e.g. VA Aging Cohort (HIV); risk factors, prevention and treatment of prescription drug abuse, office-based treatment of opioid dependence with buprenorphine, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, creation of cost effective evaluation models for patients with drug abuse, addiction and HIV including prescription drug abuse; investigation of gender and racial/ethnic disparities in identification and treatment interventions and outcomes; evaluation of screening, and treatment initiation in special populations (i.e. adolescent-elderly, veterans, incarcerated, HIV); comparison of models of screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) delivery by providers and other innovative technologies; effectiveness and implementation of SBIRT science in general medicine practice with acute and chronic medical complexities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Drug abuse, addiction, and HIV are significant public health issues, as they affect the health and well-being of a large portion of the population; have substantial negative health outcomes on individuals; and are extremely costly to the health care system. An investment in research to improve substance abuse and medical health outcomes is greatly needed. The proposed Yale-Drug Abuse, Addiction, and HIV Research Scholars (DAHRS) program focusing on general medical settings with patients throughout the life cycle will provide a three year post-doctoral, interdisciplinary, Mentored Career Development Program training six clinician-scientists for independent research careers in the field of drug abuse, addiction, and HIV through integration of prevention and treatment in general medical settings.            ","Yale Drug Abuse, Addiction, and HIV Research Scholars (Yale-DAHRS)",8650799,K12DA033312,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency

"Cohort Studies on HIV/AIDS and Substance Abuse in Miami ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Liver disease is a major cause of death in HIV infected persons in the United States. While advances in antiretroviral therapy have significantly reduced HIV-related mortality, co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), is widespread and accelerates progression of liver fibrosis to cirrhosis and liver carcinoma. In addition, substance abuse accelerates HIV disease, and may facilitate progression of liver fibrosis. The primary goal of this proposal is to continue to follow the existing Miami Adult Studies on HIV (MASH) cohort, its specimen repository and database, and expand it from the current 881 to 1,500 study participants. The purpose is to generate collaborative studies to investigate the impact of cocaine, by far the most prevalent drug of abuse in South Florida, on HIV infection, HIV/HCV co-infection, and on long-term morbidity with a focus on liver disease in this population with disparities in access to care. HIV and HCV un-infected cocaine users and non-users will also be recruited to allow determination of the impact of cocaine use alone, as well as the interaction of cocaine use with HIV, HCV, and HIV/HCV co-infection. As new and more effective treatments and access to care for HIV, HCV and drug abuse become available, maintaining a well- characterized cohort, specimen repository and database will create a strong resource platform for current and future collaborative research. Observing the uptake of new HCV treatments and potential new cocaine cessation programs in this at-risk population with health disparities will provide data on barriers and facilitators to effective treatments to prevent long-term morbidity and mortality. We have followed the MASH cohort of 881 participants for up to 12 years with excellent retention rates, and have created a specimen repository and a database. The MASH cohort in Miami is unique because it will be a mostly Hispanic cohort with a large number of African Americans, women, non-injector drug users, with predominantly heterosexual HIV- transmission etiology. We propose to (1) compare the progression of liver fibrosis over four years among cocaine users and non-users in HIV+/HCV-, HIV+/HCV+, HIV-/HCV+, and HIV-/HCV-, using a novel non- invasive diagnostic device, the Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE). We also propose to (2) compare the pattern over four years of biomarkers and identify genetic markers associated with the mechanisms of liver fibrosis among cocaine users and non-users. Understanding the role of cocaine use in the context of HIV and HIV/HCV co-infections and lack of lasting effects of treatments for cocaine use cessation are crucial in order to gain insights into the pathogenesis and disease outcomes, and to provide the basis for identifying antifibrotic therapies such as oxidative stress, which are amenable to intervention. These studies will be critical for program development, appropriate interventions, and for improving health in this population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the role of cocaine use in the context of HIV, HCV and HIV/HCV co-infections with focus on progression of liver fibrosis, is crucial in gaining insights into the disease pathogenesis, outcomes, and the role of co-morbidities and health disparities of this population. This research will provide evidence-based information for program development and evaluation, appropriate and effective interventions, and for improving health in this population.            ",Cohort Studies on HIV/AIDS and Substance Abuse in Miami,8985966,U01DA040381,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Animals ', ' Cause of Death ', ' 8-Azabicyclo(3.2.1)octane-2-carboxylic acid, 3-(benzoyloxy)-8-methyl-, methyl ester, (1R-(exo,exo))- ', ' Cocaine ', ' Cocaine Abuse ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non-A non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non A non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis nonA nonB ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' PT-NANBH ', ' Non-B Hepatitis Parenterally-Transmitted Non-A ', ' NANBH ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Immunity ', ' immunosuppression ', ' immune suppression ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' Immunosuppressions (Physiology) ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Natural immunosuppression ', ' In Vitro ', ' Laboratories ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' liver disorder ', ' hepatopathy ', ' hepatic disease ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' Liver diseases ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Health Consequences of Drug Use and IPV Trajectories for Young Latinas ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Few empirical studies have documented the life trajectories of gang-affiliated adolescent females and the long- term health consequences of adolescent drug use and partner violence victimization. The purpose of this study is to identify and determine how distinct drug use and intimate partner violence victimization trajectories that emerge in adolescence through young adulthood contribute to physical and mental health outcomes among Mexican American women within the context of a highly disadvantaged community. This group of women are particularly vulnerable given they have low rates of access and utilization of health care, are the most likely age group to be uninsured, and represent a nexus of risk, vulnerability and potentially high costs to communities given their reproductive and sexual health stage of life. This application proposes a 15 year follow up of a cohort of Mexican American adolescent females previously identified in a CDC funded study who were affiliated with male gang members during their adolescence and involved in high rates of drug use and victims of intimate partner violence. Building upon the research teams previous studies and using analytical tools from the theory of gender and power and social bonding theory, this application will implement a concurrent mixed methods nested design approach to provide a comprehensive understanding of the long-term consequences of drug use and IPV. The sample will consist of 300 young adult Mexican-American females. The specific aims for this study are: 1) determine the prevalence of physical (cardiovascular and metabolic risk markers and STI infection) and mental (depression, PTSD, anxiety/stress) health outcomes; 2) identify and characterize distinct drug use and IPV trajectories from adolescence through young adulthood; 3) determine whether sexual relationship power and family social bonds during distinct age-graded stages alter drug use and IPV trajectories and health outcomes; and 4) characterize qualitatively the culture and community context and their influence on drug use and IPV trajectories over the life course. This research will have an important positive impact by identifying women who are at the highest risk for developing harmful drug and IPV trajectories as they transition into young adulthood. In doing this, we will lay the foundation for identifying critical points of behavioral intervention during key age-graded periods as well as culturally and contextually appropriate values and strategies that will reduce health disparities among similar high-risk female populations that have gone underrepresented in existing research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This application seek a comprehensive understanding of the long term health consequences of drug use and intimate partner violence victimization physical and mental health outcomes among a vulnerable cohort of Mexican-American females recruited over 15 years ago who were affiliated with male gang members during their adolescence. The study will provide a unique opportunity to investigate detrimental life trajectories contributing t the prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic risk markers, infection, depression, PTSD, anxiety and stress within a marginalized and underserved community context. Findings will contribute to policy discourse that can lead to the development of innovative public health programs and campaigns that will reduce health disparities among minority women.

"The Development and Evaluation of the Ho'ouna Pono Drug Prevention Curriculum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research has indicated that Native Hawaiian youth have significantly higher rates of drug use than their non-Hawaiian counterparts (e.g., Wong, Klingle, & Price, 2004; Mayeda, Hishinuma, Nishimura, Garcia- Santiago, & Mark, 2006; Nishimura, Hishinuma, & Goebert, 2013), and that these differences are particularly pronounced in rural settings (Lai & Saka, 2005). Despite these findings, there have been very few drug prevention programs developed and evaluated specifically for these youth (Edwards, Giroux, & Okamoto, 2010; Rehuher, Hiramatsu, & Helm, 2008). Therefore, the purpose of this research proposal is to complete the development of a video-enhanced, culturally grounded, school-based drug prevention curriculum for rural Native Hawaiian youth (Ho'ouna Pono), and to evaluate the curriculum across all public middle/intermediate schools on Hawai'i Island. This will be accomplished through three specific aims. AIM 1 (Year 1) is to complete the Ho'ouna Pono drug prevention curriculum initially developed and validated in a NIDA-funded translational pilot/feasibility study (R34 DA031306). To date, five professionally filmed video vignettes depicting drug-related problem situations specific to rural Hawaiian youth and seven interactive classroom lessons have been created, implemented in randomly selected intervention schools, and preliminarily evaluated using a pre-test, post-test control group design. Aim 1 enhances and builds upon this work by producing two new video vignettes, re-editing a ""Behind the Scenes"" video, developing new classroom curricular components, and synthesizing the new content with the existing curriculum. AIM 2 (Years 2-3) is to evaluate the fully conceived curriculum across all middle/intermediate schools on Hawai'i Island (N = 15) using a dynamic wait- listed control group design (Brown, Wyman, Guo, & Peña, 2006). AIM 3 (Year 4) is to assess community, systemic, and curricular factors related to the implementation, adoption, and sustainability of the curriculum within public middle/intermediate schools on Hawaii Island. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Because Hawaiians or part-Hawaiians represent the largest Pacific Islander population in the U.S. (Harris & Jones, 2005) and have recently been shown to have significantly higher rates of drug use compared with other ethnic groups (Wu et al., 2013), research focused on drug prevention of these individuals is important to improve public health both in Hawai'i and on the Mainland U.S. This study actively engages rural communities in the full-scale development and evaluation of the Ho'ouna Pono drug prevention curriculum for Hawaiian youth, promoting the overall utility and effectiveness of the intervention. Further, the findings from this study will point to the core content of prevention interventions for Hawaiian youth in rural communities, which should be applicable to other ethnic youth populations in Hawaii and the Pacific Rim, as well as Native youth populations on the Mainland U.S.",The Development and Evaluation of the Ho'ouna Pono Drug Prevention Curriculum,9085947,R01DA037836,"['Adoption ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Hawaii ', ' Health ', ' Island ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Rural Health ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' Film ', ' Rural Community ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Hawaiian ', ' Hawaiian population ', ' Outcome Study ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Indigenous ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Drug Prevention Program ', ' native youth ', ' community based participatory research ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' health equity ', ' ']",NIDA,HAWAII PACIFIC UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,7236,0.11304276041447972
"Health disparity in pharmacogenomics: African American SNPs and drug metabolism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As pharmacogenomics moves from bench-top to bed-side, African Americans have been left out of the advances personalized medicine holds. To date, African Americans have been largely absent from the numerous pharmacogenetic studies that identify predictive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are being used clinically to improve care. As we move toward more comprehensive bioinformatics and high- throughput methods of evaluating the genome for functionally relevant SNPs that affect drug phenotypes, we are also producing a growing health disparity in the translation of these findings into the clinic for African Americans. Current genomic methods are trying to reach beyond genome-wide association in hopes of finding biological plausibility to genetic findings. This search has led to the use of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) as a tool in pharmacogenetic association studies. SNPs labeled as eQTLs have intrinsic biological plausibility since they are significantly associated with changes in gene expression. However, no liver eQTL studies have been conducted in African Americans. By using liver-specific eQTLs, we will discover SNPs that affect drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs), which will have wide-spread scientific and clinical impact; given that most drugs currently prescribed undergo some form of hepatic metabolism. Because of the increase genetic diversity found in African Americans, they may carry population specific SNPs can never be found by pharmacogenomics studies in populations of European-descent alone. Without African American focused pharmacogenomics studies we risk excluding African Americans from personalized medicine. We plan to use primary hepatocytes to conduct gene expression studies both before and after drug enzyme induction to identify genes that are differentially expressed. Drug enzyme induction is driven by increased gene transcription; therefore, by focusing on the genes that are differentially expressed after induction we can pin-point the drivers (i.e. genes) that regulate drug metabolizing enzymes. We will then look at SNPs within and in close proximity to these genes to determine if any are associated with differences in gene expression (dubbed DI-eQTLs). We will then look to see if these DI-eQTLs are associated with pharmacokinetic measures in the same set of cell cultures, affectedly preforming a pharmacokinetic and a pharmacogenetic study in the same individual. We hypothesize that drug enzyme induction will provide us with DI-eQTLs that are strongly associated to drug pharmacokinetics, a clinically relevant phenotype. To validate these findings we will query publically available data to look for an enrichment of our DI-eQTLs within the most strongly associated SNPs in pharmacogenomic GWAS data. The association between genotype, gene expression and drug pharmacokinetics in African Americans has never been conducted before and will provide an invaluable resource for pharmacogenomics and clinical pharmacology, as well as clinical translation in this understudied population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed studies will help identify genetic mutations that affect drug metabolism in African Americans, an under-studied population in pharmacogenomics. The discovery of these novel mutations will lead to better dosing of drugs that require the liver for metabolism and potentially less side-effects from these medications. By studying the genetic mutations that affect drug metabolism in African Americans we can more fully incorporate this population into personalized medicine.",Health disparity in pharmacogenomics: African American SNPs and drug metabolism,8890217,R01MD009217,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Age ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Beds ', ' Biology ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' Cells ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Enzyme Induction ', ' Enzymes ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' In Vitro ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' Medicine ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' Methods ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Pharmacogenetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Clinical Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Drug Side Effects ', ' Adverse drug effect ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Caring ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Hepatic ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' American ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Population Study ', ' drug metabolism ', ' drug clearance ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Genomics ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' liver metabolism ', ' Dose ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Pathway ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' Minority ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical care ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized medicine ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2015,399296,0.07890808701269215
"Brief intervention for drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV/HCV DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this study is to reduce risk behaviors and increase health and behavioral health service utilization among disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV and HCV. This project has potential to make a significant contribution to science by advancing knowledge about the health disparities, high-risk behaviors (injection drug use, sex risk), and service utilization of this high-risk, vulnerable, an understudied group of women during a time of emerging and significant public health risk in an Appalachian rural setting. This project will incorporate standardized screening (NIDA-modified ASSIST) to identify high-risk rural women drug users from jails, including injectors. Consenting women (N=350) will be asked to participate in a baseline interview, and will then be randomly assigned to one of two study groups: (1) HIV Education (HIV- Ed n=175) which includes the NIDA standard pre and post-test counseling, HIV and HCV rapid testing, and an information packet on existing community drug abuse and HIV/HCV resources; or (2) Motivational Interviewing- based HIV Risk Reduction (MI-HIV n=175) which, in addition to what is received in the HIV-Ed group, also includes an evidence-based brief intervention for high-risk women focused on an individualized plan for enhancing motivation to reduce risk behaviors and to use health and behavioral health services in the community. Specific aims include: (1) to compare the effectiveness of an evidence-based HIV risk reduction intervention (MI-HIV) to HIV Education (NIDA Standard) in reducing sex risk behaviors, injection practices, and drug use among a culturally unique sample of disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV and HCV; and (2) to examine MI-HIV Intervention engagement as a predictor of community health and behavioral health service utilization (including drug treatment and mental health) at follow-up among disadvantaged, drug- using rural women at high risk for HIV and HCV. This project is innovative because it 1) targets a high-risk and understudied group of women, 2) uses brief intervention to not only reduce risk behavior but also to enhance motivation for using community health and behavioral health resources, and 3) utilizes a real-world setting to identify high-risk women drug users. The long-term goal of this study is to increase access to health and behavioral health services in order to improve the quality of health of high-risk rural women. The overall aim of this study is to reduce risk behaviors and increase health and behavioral health service utilization among disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high risk for HIV and HCV. This project has potential to make a significant contribution to science by providing knowledge about the health, risk behaviors, and service utilization of a vulnerable and understudied group of women during a time of emerging and significant public health risk in a rural Appalachian setting. Successful completion of the aims of this project will advance the delivery of a low-cost, potentially high impact intervention with implications for a number of other real world settings (such as criminal justice venues) where other disadvantaged high-risk drug users can be identified and targeted for intervention.",Brief intervention for drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV/HCV,9045757,R01DA033866,"['Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' Counseling ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Injections ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Interview ', ' Kentucky ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Random Selection ', ' Random Allocation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Walkers ', ' Woman ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' HCV ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Rural ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Staging ', ' Drug user ', ' Opiates ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' treatment planning ', ' Participant ', ' high risk behavior ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' drug resource ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Jail ', ' Consent ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' comparison group ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' service utilization ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' prescription opiate ', ' screening ', ' injection drug use ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2015,66477,0.12069110669681299
"Stress and Drug Use Vulnerability in the African American Community DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The impacts that drug addictions have on health disparities that adversely affect African Americans are grossly understudied. While there is strong evidence linking drug abuse to poor health and problem behaviors in the African American community, the progression of drug abuse is inconsistent (i.e., relatively late initiation and heavy use in the 30s) with national norms and remains unclear. Exposure to chronic stress and the subsequent activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been connected to drug addictions and poor health outcomes. This association is of particular importance since residents in these communities are exposed to many of the risk factors associated with the onset of drug abuse: familial risk, deprived social environment, unemployment, substandard education, low-to-no socioeconomic status, and enduring exposure to experiences of racism and discrimination. Repeated exposure to environmental stressors will lead to 'wear-and-tear' on the body's regulatory system and have profound implications on HPA functioning and the subsequent risk of developing an addiction. This study will pursue three primary aims: (1) Investigate HPA reactivity to acute stress as a predictor of current drug use severity. (2) Investigate trajectories of HPA regulation (level and circadian rhythm) as a predicto of drug use vulnerability across time. (3) Investigate delay discounting as a moderator between trajectories of HPA regulation and drug use vulnerability across time. This study will enroll 350 African American adults (ages 18-21) who reside in the southeastern U.S. and utilize a prospective longitudinal research design that consists of a laboratory assessment involving the Trier Social Stress Test, three in-home assessments that include clinical interviews and behavioral tasks, and six internet assessments that track drug use and related risk factors across a 2-year period. Primary independent variables include environmental stressors, stress-related biomarkers (i.e., salivary cortical, salivary DHEA, heart rate variability, and galvanic skn resistance), and delay discounting. Primary dependent variables include drug use, severity of drug use disorders, and drug use consequences. This study is highly innovative for three primary reasons: (1) A longitudinal research design will be used for the first time to investigate trajectories of HPA regulation as a predictor of drug use vulnerability; (2) The use of multiple indicators of the stress regulatory system, clinical interviews, and a novel behavioral task provides a more nuanced understanding of the research aims; and (3) This study focuses on an understudied population that suffers from drug-related health disparities, but are rarely included in cutting edge laboratory research. It is envisioned that this approach will uncover latent-curve trajectories of stress deregulation as a predictor of drug use vulnerability in this population. Findings from this study will identify causal mechanisms of drug addictions that will advance theory, research, prevention, and treatments aimed at addressing this growing public health problem. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of drug abuse in the African American community is often characterized by oversimplified models that are rooted in research studies that rarely include African Americans. This study will identify mechanisms that influence drug use vulnerability in at-risk African American adults who reside in the southeastern U.S. Such research is needed to develop socially and culturally informed prevention and treatment programs aimed at reducing drug-related health disparities that continue to plague African Americans.",Stress and Drug Use Vulnerability in the African

"Contextualizing & responding to HIV risk behaviors among Black drug offenders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Formerly incarcerated Black drug offenders are at an elevated risk for HIV infection. Despite substantial research expressing the need for HIV prevention services for ex-offenders post-release, this population has limited access to quality programming and services related to HIV risk reduction. This K01 application seeks to inform and adapt an HIV risk reduction intervention to address the needs of formerly incarcerated Black drug offenders who are being released from prisons in the New York City metropolitan area. This application supports the Principal Investigator's interest in becoming an independent behavioral scientist specializing in HIV prevention intervention development and adaptation. The proposed mentorship and training program will focus on the following key areas: mixed methods research; adaptation science; and intervention implementation. The proposed study will occur in three phases implemented over the course of five years. The formative phase will consist of survey administration on HIV literacy, needs and barriers to practicing protective behaviors, and HIV testing from 120 recently released Black drug offenders. Also during this phase, in-depth interviews with a subsample of 24 participants (12 male and 12 female participants) will also be conducted to gather more comprehensive information exploring needs and barriers to practicing HIV protective behaviors. The intervention development and adaptation phase, will consist of analyzing data from the survey research and in-depth interviews to tailor it for use with recently released Black drug offenders. In phase 3, the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted intervention will be pilot tested using a randomized clinical trial with 64 participants who are randomized to the adapted intervention or an Enhanced Referral Intervention arm. Building on the Information-Motivation and Behavioral Skills Model, this study will address the following specific aims: 1) To examine individual-level, environmental and contextual factors that affect HIV risk-related behaviors (i.e. illicit drug use and risky sexual behavior) among formerly incarcerated Black male and female drug offenders; 2) To adapt Project START, an HIV risk reduction intervention for formerly incarcerated men, using data gathered from Aim 1, to increase access to HIV testing and address drivers of HIV vulnerability among recently released Black male and female drug offenders; and 3) To pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted Project START using a randomized clinical trial with 64 participants (32 men, 32 women). The proposed study will utilize a mixed-methods approach to investigate drivers of HIV risk among recently released Black drug offenders. By providing more contextual information on risk behaviors, future evidence-based approaches can be developed and rapidly deployed, advancing HIV prevention science, and providing essential support for a vulnerable population that consistently experiences barriers in accessing HIV prevention services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K01 application seeks to inform and adapt an HIV risk reduction intervention to address the needs of formerly incarcerated Black drug offenders who are being released from prisons in the New York City metropolitan area. The proposed mentorship and training program will focus on the following key areas: mixed methods research; adaptation science; and intervention implementation.

"Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  The Western States (WS) Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) promotes evidence-based drug abuse prevention and treatment services through continued participation in the CTN. The Node 1) designs and implements clinical trials of evidence-based treatments of addiction through rapid recruitment of diverse study participants in partnership with NIDA and the CTN, 2) generates peer-reviewed publications in collaboration with treatment providers and other nodes, and 3) uses the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Regional Research and Training Center includes talented faculty and staff from Oregon Health & Science Center and University of California, San Francisco as well as leaders of affiliated healthcare partners providing integrated primary care and substance use disorder treatment. The Node was created in 2010 as an amalgam of two CTN Nodes--California-Arizona and Oregon/Hawaii (a charter member of the CTN). The Node was highly successful, during the current award, participating in 10 CTN trials, co-leading two of these and leading one; reporting results of CTN main studies, ancillary, and research using the CTN platform in 100+ publications, and actively disseminating evidence- based practices in 200 presentations. Node investigators also sought and received awards for 10 studies that used the CTN as a platform for research. Eight WS Node healthcare programs recruited over 1,300 participants into CTN studies. In the coming grant period the Node expands to include three national and regional primary care and HIV primary care research networks: OCHIN, the HIV Research Network, and the Oregon Rural Practice-Based Research Network (ORPRN). The Node retains core addiction treatment centers experienced in CTN protocols and exploits their links with primary care: Adapt (Roseburg, OR), CODA (Portland, OR) HealthRIGHT 360 (San Francisco, CA), La Frontera (Tucson, AZ), NARA (Portland, OR), and Signal Behavioral Health Network (Denver, CO). The Node's research agenda proposes study concepts that evaluate three strategies to integrate and enhance addiction treatment within healthcare settings. Study 1 builds a patient registry for HCV infection and tests a multi-contact brief intervention for alcohol use. Study 2 extends the registry testing a candidate therapeutic HIV vaccine. Study 3, a test of reverse integration (primary care clinicians in addiction treatment settings), assesses naloxone distribution and education to reduce fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses and measures impact on return to use. Finally the WS Node continues to use the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Node has the potential to accelerate the advancement of integrated primary care and addiction in the coming years.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This renewal application to conduct research in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network has broad public health implications focused on developing and testing ways to better treat medical problems and addiction through integrated care. The project will conduct clinical trials of treatments for drug use disorders in the context of primary care addressing hepatitis C, HIV, and opioid overdose--topics of urgent national importance. This research can accelerate the advancement of providing integrated treatments for medical problems and addiction in the coming years.            ",Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse

"Mentoring researchers on drug abuse and HIV DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug users with and at-risk for HIV continue to have poor access to health care and poor treatment outcomes. In addition, opioid addiction involving prescription opioids has skyrocketed. In this proposal for a mid-career investigator award, Dr. Chinazo Cunningham proposes to address the opioid epidemic and its intersection with HIV infection by: 1) becoming an internationally recognized leader in the field of drug abuse and HIV, expanding her research to include advanced research methods (comparative effectiveness research [CER] methods and complex clinical trials methods); 2) developing a standardized and structured mentorship approach to mentor junior investigators to conduct patient-oriented research related to drug abuse and/or HIV infection; and 3) becoming an effective leader in academic medicine, ensuring that the institutional infrastructure facilitates junior investigators obtaining skills necessary to become independent investigators. To achieve these goals, Dr. Cunningham will participate in courses and national conferences, have directed readings, and regularly meet with national leaders in related fields. Dr. Cunningham will particularly focus on mentoring women and racial/ethnic minorities-two groups who are under-represented in senior positions in academic medicine and NIH-funded research. Dr. Cunningham will utilize her existing research program as a foundation for which she will provide mentoring and expand her research skills to include CER and complex clinical trials methods. The aims of her research are to: 1) test the efficacy of a 16-week abstinence-reinforcing contingency management intervention on HIV viral load suppression among opioid-dependent HIV-infected individuals, using a randomized controlled trial design; and 2) examine mechanisms of achieving viral load suppression with the abstinence-reinforcing contingency management intervention. Dr. Cunningham's future research will include the establishment of a comprehensive ""live"" database of all opioid users within a large urban medical center. This database will be used to examine health outcomes associated with types of opioid use and to develop and test interventions focused on opioid use. Dr. Cunningham's long-term career objective is to improve access to care and health outcomes among drug-abusing populations with or at-risk for HIV infection by developing interventions that can reduce their disparities in health care and health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application for a K24 mid-career investigator award seeks to provide support to Dr. Chinazo Cunningham to provide excellent mentorship, effective leadership, and expand her current research to include advanced research methods (comparative effectiveness research methods and complex clinical trials methods). Dr. Cunningham will mentor junior investigators in the areas of drug abuse and HIV, with an emphasis on providing mentorship to racial/ethnic minorities and women. Dr. Cunningham will use her existing research project as a foundation to provide much of her mentorship. In addition, expanding her research to include comparative effectiveness research and complex clinical trials focused on opioid use will allow her to conduct new research and provide additional mentorship that can ultimately improve health outcomes of drug users with and at-risk for HIV.",Mentoring researchers on drug abuse and HIV,8824505,K24DA036955,"['Award ', ' Behavior ', '

"Risk Factors for AIDS among Drug Users: Getting Close to Zero ﻿    DESCRIPTION: UNAIDS has announced a goal of Getting to Zero New HIV infections and Secretary Clinton has announced a goal of an AIDS free generation. Completely eliminating new HIV infections may not be possible in any large population of persons at high risk for HIV, but combined prevention, including treatment as prevention (TasP) may permit getting very close to zero new HIV infections. Psychoactive drug use generates many impediments getting close to zero. Drug use can lead to HIV infection through both sharing injection equipment and through drug use related unsafe sexual behavior. Drug use may also interfere with accessing and adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Psychoactive drug use is also strongly associated with higher rates of HIV infection among racial/ethnic minorities. In this research, we will examine whether combined prevention can get close to zero new HIV infections among injecting and non-injecting drug users in New York City, including whether getting close to zero can minimize racial/ethnic disparities.  If combined prevention does lead to getting close to zero new infections drug users in NYC. This will require a) an analytic description of combined prevention, b) a clear conceptualization of getting close to zero, and c) new metrics and methods for assessing being close to zero.  We will study getting close to zero new HIV infections for drug users in NYC through four specific aims: 1. Determine the extent to which combined prevention  is getting close to zero for injecting related transmission of HIV in NYC. Develop new metrics for measuring a CtZ situation for injecting-related transmission and how racial/ethnic disparities might be minimized. 2. Conduct mathematical modeling, using biomarkers for high injecting risk (HCV infection) and high sexual risk (HSV-2 infection) and behavioral data to analyze HIV infection among PWID in terms of: 1) the PWID population as a whole, 2) disparities among major racial/ethnic groups, 3) sustainability for maintaining a CTZ situation with combined prevention, and 4) injecting related vs. sexual transmission of HIV among PWID. 3. Determine the extent to which ""combined prevention"" is reducing drug related sexual (DRS) transmission of HIV among non-injecting drug users (NIDUs) and PWID in NYC. Develop new metrics for measuring the potential for continuing sexual transmission and assess coverage of Treatment as Prevention (TasP) among NIDUs. Monitor trends in HSV-2 infection as a continuing driver of drug use sexual transmission. 4. Utilize geospatial analysis to characterize ""hotspots"" for continuing transmission of HIV among drug users in NYC, including potential geographic overlap between injecting related and sexual transmission of HIV, and racial/ethnic and HIV service characteristics of hotspots.  We will accomplish these aims through interviews and HIV, HCV, and HSV-2 testing of 600 subjects per year and continuation of our long-standing collaborations with the NY City and State Health Departments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: UNAIDS has announced a goal of ""getting to zero"" new HIV infections and the US government has announced a parallel goal of achieving ""an AIDS free generation. We will study whether combined prevention leads to ""getting close to zero"" new HIV infections for injecting and non-injecting drug users in New York City. This will include developing bio-behavioral metrics for use in getting close to zero, mathematical modeling, and identifying geographic ""hotspots"" of persistent probability of HIV transmission.                     ",Risk Factors for AIDS among Drug Users: Getting Close to Zero,8846354,R01DA003574,"['Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Cities ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Equipment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non-A non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non A non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis nonA nonB ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' PT-NANBH ', ' Non-B Hepatitis Parenterally-Transmitted Non-A ', ' NANBH ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' human alphaherpesvirus 2 ', ' herpes simplex ii ', ' Human herpes simplex virus type 2 ', ' Human (alpha) herpes virus 2 ', ' Herpesvirus progenitalis ', ' Herpesvirus 2 (alpha), Human ', ' Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 ', ' Herpes Simplex Virus 2 ', ' HSV2 ', ' HSV-2 ', ' HHV-2 ', ' Human Herpesvirus 2 ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HIV Seroprevalence ', ' Housing ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Infection ', ' Injections ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Persons ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Probability ', ' Psychopharmaceuticals ', ' Psychoactive Drugs ', ' Psychoactive Compound ', ' Psychoactive Agents ', ' Psychotropic Drugs ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Social Marketing ', ' Syringes ', ' Testing ', ' Vaccines ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' HCV ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Collaborations ', ' Drug user ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' c new ', ' condoms ', ' Prevention program ', ' Shares syringes ', ' Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Modeling ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematical model ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' ']",NIDA,BETH ISRAEL MEDICAL CTR (NEW YORK),R01,2015,651735,0.10540491543263228
"African American Offenders: Drug Use, Mental Health and HIV Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The primary goal of this K08 award is to further develop a productive independent research career in drug abuse research. The training and career development plan will enhance Dr. Stevens-Watkins's research experience in primary data collection with prisoners focused on drug use, mental health, and HIV thus resulting in the clarification of the specific aims of an R01 submission in years 4 and 5. The proposed training objectives are: (1) to receive training in the epidemiology of drug abuse, mental health, and HIV as they relate to health disparities among African Americans; (2) to further develop expertise in research with special populations, biostatistics, and advanced quantitative analyses including non-linear, categorical models, and structural equation modeling; (3) to use the data collected in the proposed research plan as pilot data for an R01 research proposal. The specified training goals are aligned with the research aims and compliment the clinical experience of the candidate. Dr. Stevens-Watkins will be sponsored by her established mentors, Drs. Carl Leukefeld and Carrie Oser, both with expertise in drug abuse and HIV research. Of high significance, HIV has recently been termed a ""crisis"" in the African American community. The overall goal of the proposed research plan is to better understand the complex and dynamic relationship between drug use, mental health, and HIV risk among African American male prisoners nearing community re-entry. The specific aims are (1) to explore drug use, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and HIV risk behaviors among African American male inmates by conducting a thorough literature review and devising an analytical model using biostatics multivariate analytic techniques with available data; (2) to identify prevalence, incidence, and predictors of drug use disorders, anxiety, depressive disorders and HIV sexual risk behaviors among 205 incarcerated African American men; (3) to examine the knowledge, patterns, and perceived cultural and community barriers to utilizing individual and health resources and their relationship to substance abuse recovery and HIV risk behaviors among 205 African American men upon release from prison. Baseline data will be collected in prison and follow-up data collection will occur when participants have been released in the community after 3-months. The proposed research plan will offer HIV testing and counseling to an at-risk population that has historically been difficult to engage in research and HIV testing, subsequently significantly impacting public health by possibly preventing the spread of HIV. The candidate's immediate career goals include published manuscripts and R01 funding by the end of K08 funding, with an ultimate career goal of becoming an independent clinical drug abuse researcher. This proposal includes an outstanding mentoring team, as well as a feasible training and research plan utilizing resources offered by both Spalding University and the University of Kentucky. The proposed project has significant public health implications for reducing the spread of HIV among the African American community by offering testing and by targeting men exiting prison, re-entering the community. The proposed project will generate an improved understanding of the complex relationship between drug use, mental health, and HIV risk among an at-risk group.","African American Offenders: Drug Use, Mental Health and HIV Risk",8846086,K08DA032296,"['Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Career Path ', ' Career Choice ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Housing ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Kentucky ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' jail inmate ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' Prisoner ', ' Prisons ', ' Psychologist ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Writing ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Phase ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' racism ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Development Plans ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Review Literature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Equation ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' experience ', ' impression ', ' Special Population ', ' named group ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Participant ', ' criminal offender ', ' offender ', ' intravenous drug use ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' correctional system ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' community re-entry ', ' community reentry ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' drug detection ', ' drug testing ', ' high risk ', ' public health research ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,K08,2015,135099,0.1550195541722535

"Yale Drug Abuse, Addiction, and HIV Research Scholars (Yale-DAHRS) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a critical need to develop a diverse pool of highly trained clinician scholars to foster the development of biomedical, behavioral and clinical research related to drug abuse, addiction, and HIV prevention and treatment in general medical settings. Patients who abuse substances are more likely to be seen in general medical settings such as emergency departments (ED), general medical primary care clinics and inpatient wards, HIV and adolescent health clinics, and women's health centers. These patients often present with a complex array of acute consequences and complications (e.g. intoxication, overdose, withdrawal, trauma and infectious diseases) of substance use as well as chronic conditions such as HIV disease, hepatitis, pulmonary and cardiovascular disease. Objectives: The Yale-Drug Abuse, Addiction, and HIV Research Scholars (DAHRS) program provides a comprehensive three year post-doctorate, interdisciplinary, Mentored Career Development Program to improve drug abuse, addiction, and HIV medical outcomes integrating prevention and treatment in general medical settings including ED, primary care, HIV, adolescent, and women's health clinics. Specifically, Yale-DAHRS will: [Aim 1] Develop clinician scientists with the knowledge, skills, and ability to become independent investigators, generating findings of practical value with significant impact to improve health outcomes of patients with and at risk for drug abuse, addiction, and HIV; [Aim 2] Develop future leaders by providing Scholars with leadership tools and skills and creating individualized programs to ensure success in leading multidisciplinary research teams in studying drug abuse, addiction and HIV, and implementation and integration of research findings into general medical settings; and [Aim 3] Enhance the diversity of drug abuse, addiction, and HIV researchers. Addressing women and minority faculty under representation will enhance the diversity of investigators and research topics, broaden perspectives in setting research priorities, increase clinical trial participation, and expand knowledge. Working synergistically with Yale's established training programs in drug abuse, HIV and clinical investigation, Yale- DAHRS will capitalize on existing academic infrastructure and expertise to ensure success. Unique, features include: (1) An interdisciplinary, diverse faculty of independent researchers in illicit and prescription drug abuse and addiction, tobacco, alcohol, HIV, and medical complexities such as pain and hepatitis C; (2) Synergy with well established, high quality post-doctoral training programs at Yale; (3) The use of clinical informatics for data collection, data management, diagnostic tool development, and information dissemination; and (4) The integration of such diverse fields as public health, informatics, clinical epidemiology, systems engineering and demography with the traditional clinical sciences of internal medicine, emergency medicine, HIV medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry, and psychology; (5) Established clinical research laboratories, including the Yale-New Haven Hospital, a tertiary care center for southern New England and a community hospital for the Greater New Haven Area, serving an ethnically, racially, culturally, and economically diverse population, a Veterans Affairs Medical Center and community treatment centers such as the APT Foundation and Federally Qualified Health Centers; (6) Synergies with established research centers and institutes such as the Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS and the Veterans Aging Cohort on HIV. Career Development Plan: Yale-DAHRS is a three year research training program that will prepare a total of six clinician investigators for careers focusing on drug abuse, addiction, and HIV in general medical settings during its first funding cycle. Scholars will earn the Master in Health Sciences degree, combining rigorous training in research methodology, statistics and design with seminars in topics related to drug abuse, addiction, and HIV content, leadership, grant writing and responsible conduct of research. Candidates will complete published mentored research project(s) and prepare an application for the next career step; i.e. NIH R21, R03, R15, R34 mechanism. The collaboration of the multidisciplinary faculty and the combined robust strengths of two principal investigators from Emergency and Internal Medicine, both with extensive experience mentoring and as independent funded investigators will drive the Yale-DAHRS program. Potential Research Projects: Multiple research projects are ""shovel ready"" for Scholar training and can be completed within our allotted time frame, such as secondary data analysis using national large datasets e.g. VA Aging Cohort (HIV); risk factors, prevention and treatment of prescription drug abuse, office-based treatment of opioid dependence with buprenorphine, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, creation of cost effective evaluation models for patients with drug abuse, addiction and HIV including prescription drug abuse; investigation of gender and racial/ethnic disparities in identification and treatment interventions and outcomes; evaluation of screening, and treatment initiation in special populations (i.e. adolescent-elderly, veterans, incarcerated, HIV); comparison of models of screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) delivery by providers and other innovative technologies; effectiveness and implementation of SBIRT science in general medicine practice with acute and chronic medical complexities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Drug abuse, addiction, and HIV are significant public health issues, as they affect the health and well-being of a large portion of the population; have substantial negative health outcomes on individuals; and are extremely costly to the health care system. An investment in research to improve substance abuse and medical health outcomes is greatly needed. The proposed Yale-Drug Abuse, Addiction, and HIV Research Scholars (DAHRS) program focusing on general medical settings with patients throughout the life cycle will provide a three year post-doctoral, interdisciplinary, Mentored Career Development Program training six clinician-scientists for independent research careers in the field of drug abuse, addiction, and HIV through integration of prevention and treatment in general medical settings.","Yale Drug Abuse, Addiction, and HIV Research Scholars (Yale-DAHRS)",8829809,K12DA033312,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', '

"Couple HIV prevention for drug-involved male offenders: An Effectiveness Trial DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study responds to PA-09-236 entitled ""HIV/AIDS, Drug Use, and Vulnerable Populations."" This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will rigorously evaluate the implementation, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a couple-based integrated HIV/STI and drug abuse prevention intervention (Connect II) with drug-involved male offenders charged with misdemeanors and their primary female sexual partners, implemented by frontline providers in Criminal Court, Community Court or Probation (CCP) sites in the Bronx, NY, compared to CCP standard treatment of care services (TAU). The primary outcomes are biologically confirmed sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and self-reported condom use. This study will yield important data on implementation factors associated with effectiveness of the proposed intervention in real world resource-constrained criminal justice settings. The proposed CCP study sites are located in the South Bronx, the poorest Congressional District in the U.S. with 96% of residents identifying as Black or Latino. The South Bronx has an HIV prevalence rate of 2.6%. Research has found that 12% of men on probation in New York City are HIV positive. Though the criminal justice system is recognized as the epicenter of the epidemic in the U.S., few, if any, HIV prevention interventions have been developed for the huge number of male offenders under community supervision who represent 90% of the corrections population. No HIV/STI prevention services are currently provided at the proposed CCP sites. The proposed intervention is designed to address this critical gap in services. Connect II was found to be efficacious among drug-involved couples in reducing risky drug and sexual behaviors and drug use. In the proposed study we aim to advance the knowledge of implementation science by testing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Connect II delivered by frontline providers in the real world settings of CCP sites with 240 drug-involved male offenders and their female partners (N=480 participants). Eligible couples will be randomly assigned to either (1) a 4-session Connect II delivered to both partners together + TAU delivered to male participant alone, or (2) a TAU control condition delivered to the male participant. Repeated assessments will occur at baseline and 3, 6, and 12-months post intervention. The study will be conducted by Dr. Nabila El-Bassel, Dr. Louisa Gilbert, and an investigative team from Columbia University in collaboration with Michael Rempel from the Center for Court Innovation and the New York City Department of Probation. If found to be effective, Connect II may be scaled up in community criminal justice settings nationwide to curb the spread of HIV/STIs and to reduce HIV disparities in heavily impacted communities like the South Bronx. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This study addresses the significant public health threat of HIV and other STIs among drug- involved male offenders under community supervision and their female partners. This study will evaluate the implementation, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a brief couple-based HIV and drug abuse prevention intervention for drug-involved male offenders and their female partners delivered by frontline providers in Criminal/Community Court and Probation sites in the South Bronx, the poorest congressional district in the U.S. If found to be effective, the proposed brief intervention may be scaled up to community criminal justice sites nationwide to curb the spread of HIV/STIs and reduce HIV disparities.",Couple HIV prevention for drug-involved male offenders: An Effectiveness Trial,8892127,R01DA033168,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Charge ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Couples ', ' Drug Utilization ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Institutes ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' New York City ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Latino ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' court ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' Consult ', ' Services ', ' professor ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' recidivism ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' probation ', ' criminal offender ', ' offender ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' prevent drug use ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' post intervention ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' efficacy research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' probationer ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' demographics ', ' implementation science ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' standard treatment ', ' standard care ', ' ']",NIDA,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2015,644544,0.06416710644856985
"Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  The Western States (WS) Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) promotes evidence-based drug abuse prevention and treatment services through continued participation in the CTN. The Node 1) designs and implements clinical trials of evidence-based treatments of addiction through rapid recruitment of diverse study participants in partnership with NIDA and the CTN, 2) generates peer-reviewed publications in collaboration with treatment providers and other nodes, and 3) uses the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Regional Research and Training Center includes talented faculty and staff from Oregon Health & Science Center and University of California, San Francisco as well as leaders of affiliated healthcare partners providing integrated primary care and substance use disorder treatment. The Node was created in 2010 as an amalgam of two CTN Nodes--California-Arizona and Oregon/Hawaii (a charter member of the CTN). The Node was highly successful, during the current award, participating in 10 CTN trials, co-leading two of these and leading one; reporting results of CTN main studies, ancillary, and research using the CTN platform in 100+ publications, and actively disseminating evidence- based practices in 200 presentations. Node investigators also sought and received awards for 10 studies that used the CTN as a platform for research. Eight WS Node healthcare programs recruited over 1,300 participants into CTN studies. In the coming grant period the Node expands to include three national and regional primary care and HIV primary care research networks: OCHIN, the HIV Research Network, and the Oregon Rural Practice-Based Research Network (ORPRN). The Node retains core addiction treatment centers experienced in CTN protocols and exploits their links with primary care: Adapt (Roseburg, OR), CODA (Portland, OR) HealthRIGHT 360 (San Francisco, CA), La Frontera (Tucson, AZ), NARA (Portland, OR), and Signal Behavioral Health Network (Denver, CO). The Node's research agenda proposes study concepts that evaluate three strategies to integrate and enhance addiction treatment within healthcare settings. Study 1 builds a patient registry for HCV infection and tests a multi-contact brief intervention for alcohol use. Study 2 extends the registry testing a candidate therapeutic HIV vaccine. Study 3, a test of reverse integration (primary care clinicians in addiction treatment settings), assesses naloxone distribution and education to reduce fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses and measures impact on return to use. Finally the WS Node continues to use the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Node has the potential to accelerate the advancement of integrated primary care and addiction in the coming years. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This renewal application to conduct research in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network has broad public health implications focused on developing and testing ways to better treat medical problems and addiction through integrated care. The project will conduct clinical trials of treatments for drug use disorders in the context of primary care addressing hepatitis C, HIV, and opioid overdose--topics of urgent national importance.

"Age-Varying Effects in the Epidemiology of Drug Abuse ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To improve the efficiency and efficacy of drug abuse interventions, an understanding of the age-related changes in behavior prevalences, comorbidities, and health disparities, and the evolving role of various risk factors from adolescence through middle adulthood, is crucial. Today there is an unprecedented amount of existing high-quality data that have enormous potential to shed new light on these issues. Many of these data sets are nationally representative, drawn from populations that span a wide range of ages. New methods now exist to tap those data in order to address important, new scientific questions about drug use, abuse, and dependence (drug UAD) from a developmental perspective. To this end, we propose the innovative application of the time-varying effect model (TVEM) to data from two complementary national studies of health risk behaviors: The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=20,745) and the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N=63,809). TVEM flexibly estimates behavior prevalences and associations among variables as continuous, flexible functions of age. Specifically, the specific aims for this projec are as follows. (1) To model flexible, age-varying trends in drug UAD from adolescence into middle adulthood. We will estimate rates of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and other drug use, abuse and dependence as a complex function of continuous age from ages 12 to 50. Trends will be estimated across sex and race/ethnicity to document age-varying health disparities. (2) To elucidate the age-varying role of mental health problems in the course of drug UAD from adolescence into middle adulthood. We will examine how depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation are differentially associated with drug UAD as a continuous, complex function from ages 12 to 50. (3) To estimate age-varying effects of early and concurrent risk factors on drug UAD from adolescence into middle adulthood. We will examine how and when specific risk and protective factors are associated with drug UAD from ages 12 to 50. We will consider early risk factors at the individual, parent, peer, school, and community levels, as well as concurrent factors such as marriage and parenthood. (4) To examine contributors to health disparities in drug use. To advance understanding of the developmental course of health disparities, we will examine sex and race/ethnicity as moderators of (a) age-varying comorbidities of drug UAD and mental health problems and (b) age-varying associations between risk factors and drug UAD. This project will provide knowledge about the developmental course of drug UAD and related health disparities, allowing prevention scientists and clinicians to design interventions that matc the most promising mechanisms of change to the most appropriate age period within population subgroups. To maximize the project's overall impact, we will actively disseminate this promising new analytic approach to drug abuse researchers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Existing national data have been used extensively to advance understanding of drug use, abuse, and dependence; comorbidities with mental health problems; the role of early and concurrent risk factors; and health disparities. However, empirical studies and behavioral theory have been largely silent on how these issues evolve continuously across age. This project will apply a new data analytic approach to existing cross- sectional and panel data to gain new insight into nuanced, age-related changes from adolescence through mid-adulthood, shedding light on ways to tailor interventions to individuals to increase intervention efficiency and efficacy to reduce drug abuse and its related consequences.                ",Age-Varying Effects in the Epidemiology of Drug Abuse,8940295,R01DA039854,"['Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Employment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Health ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' marijuana ', ' Marihuana ', ' Marital Status ', ' Marriage ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Paper ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Data Quality ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Intercept ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' trend ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' attributable death ', ' attributable mortality ', ' cost ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' ']",NIDA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2015,226050,0.21078522912097405
"Epidemiology, Prevention and Treatment of HCV in Young Adult Persons who Inject Drugs in non-urban New Mexico ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic in the U.S. is concentrated in people who inject drugs (PWID). Increasing reports of HCV including outbreaks of HCV in young adult PWID in non-urban locales have prompted concerns about an expanding epidemic. Several investigations suggest that that these spikes in HCV infection are linked to sharp increases in prescription opiate use that has been trending in the U.S, and which have resulted in young adults transitioning from prescription opiates to injection use, particularly heroin. Young adult PWID in non-urban areas may be at increased risk of infection, from the combination of high viral infectivity and high prevalence of HCV in injecting groups, together with a lack of knowledge regarding infection routes and effective prevention. New Mexico is one of the states leading recorded increases in HCV in young adults, ranking 2nd in the CDC's Emerging Infections Program (EIP), Hepatitis Surveillance Demonstration Sites project, in 2011 for the number and rate of HCV cases reported. Heroin, prescription opioids, and other drugs are also accounting for this state having one of the highest overdose rates in the country. Between October 2013 and March 2014, the New Mexico Department of Health recorded 211 cases of HCV among young adults in a pilot surveillance study, demonstrating the gravity of the problem. To address the need for prevention, care and treatment services against HCV in this population, we propose epidemiological and service uptake research in two regions of New Mexico where young adult PWID have been impacted by drug use and HCV. We will initiate a prospective cohort study of young adult non-urban PWID who will be recruited and followed in two health regions of New Mexico (the South West and North East) to: (1) gather epidemiologic data on risk behaviors, drug use patterns, injection networks, prevention needs, and health service utilization; (2) to refer young adult PWID to HCV care services, as well as other prevention and treatment opportunities including harm reduction and drug treatment, and assess rates of successful linkage, including the  cascade of care; (3) to examine factors that may contribute to non-treatment, poor adherence, and failure to achieve SVR among young adult PWID with chronic HCV infection; and (4) assess reinfection events among young adult PWID who are treated for HCV and achieve SVR. Our proposal, which we refer to in this application as New Mexico H-TIPS, will also include testing and referrals for HIV and HBV co-infections as well. A collaborative group of public health and clinical specialists linked with a strong prevention and clinical service infrastructure in New Mexico will ensure successful implementation of this research. Results from this proposed research will impact a diverse young population disproportionately at risk for HCV and reduce health disparities in a region highly impacted by drug use and HCV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed three-year research plan seeks to assess the epidemiology of HCV infection in young adult people who inject drugs (PWID) in non-urban areas of New Mexico. The proposed New Mexico H-TIPS project will study factors that will inform effective and integrated care and prevention models for this high-risk population. We have significant expertise in working with the target population, including recruitment and retention and in identifying HCV infection, which together with a unique infrastructure for preventive and clinical services in New Mexico, including HCV and drug treatment make this proposal highly likely to succeed. This research will contribute significantly to further knowledge of  combination  HCV prevention, and how to impact population prevalence and incidence of HCV in New Mexico and elsewhere.","Epidemiology, Prevention and Treatment of HCV in Young Adult Persons who Inject Drugs in non-urban New Mexico",8917031,U18PS004568,[''],NCHHSTP,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,U18,2015,305451,0.0839915446261307

"The Development and Evaluation of the Ho'ouna Pono Drug Prevention Curriculum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research has indicated that Native Hawaiian youth have significantly higher rates of drug use than their non-Hawaiian counterparts (e.g., Wong, Klingle, & Price, 2004; Mayeda, Hishinuma, Nishimura, Garcia- Santiago, & Mark, 2006; Nishimura, Hishinuma, & Goebert, 2013), and that these differences are particularly pronounced in rural settings (Lai & Saka, 2005). Despite these findings, there have been very few drug prevention programs developed and evaluated specifically for these youth (Edwards, Giroux, & Okamoto, 2010; Rehuher, Hiramatsu, & Helm, 2008). Therefore, the purpose of this research proposal is to complete the development of a video-enhanced, culturally grounded, school-based drug prevention curriculum for rural Native Hawaiian youth (Ho'ouna Pono), and to evaluate the curriculum across all public middle/intermediate schools on Hawai'i Island. This will be accomplished through three specific aims. AIM 1 (Year 1) is to complete the Ho'ouna Pono drug prevention curriculum initially developed and validated in a NIDA-funded translational pilot/feasibility study (R34 DA031306). To date, five professionally filmed video vignettes depicting drug-related problem situations specific to rural Hawaiian youth and seven interactive classroom lessons have been created, implemented in randomly selected intervention schools, and preliminarily evaluated using a pre-test, post-test control group design. Aim 1 enhances and builds upon this work by producing two new video vignettes, re-editing a ""Behind the Scenes"" video, developing new classroom curricular components, and synthesizing the new content with the existing curriculum. AIM 2 (Years 2-3) is to evaluate the fully conceived curriculum across all middle/intermediate schools on Hawai'i Island (N = 15) using a dynamic wait- listed control group design (Brown, Wyman, Guo, & Peña, 2006). AIM 3 (Year 4) is to assess community, systemic, and curricular factors related to the implementation, adoption, and sustainability of the curriculum within public middle/intermediate schools on Hawaii Island.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Because Hawaiians or part-Hawaiians represent the largest Pacific Islander population in the U.S. (Harris & Jones, 2005) and have recently been shown to have significantly higher rates of drug use compared with other ethnic groups (Wu et al., 2013), research focused on drug prevention of these individuals is important to improve public health both in Hawai'i and on the Mainland U.S. This study actively engages rural communities in the full-scale development and evaluation of the Ho'ouna Pono drug prevention curriculum for Hawaiian youth, promoting the overall utility and effectiveness of the intervention. Further, the findings from this study will point to the core content of prevention interventions for Hawaiian youth in rural communities, which should be applicable to other ethnic youth populations in Hawaii and the Pacific Rim, as well as Native youth populations on the Mainland U.S.                ",The Development and Evaluation of the Ho'ouna Pono Drug Prevention Curriculum,8848653,R01DA037836,"['Adoption ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Hawaii ', ' Island ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Rural Health ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' Film ', ' Rural Community ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Hawaiian ', ' Hawaiian population ', ' Outcome Study ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Indigenous ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Drug Prevention Program ', ' native youth ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' health equity ', ' ']",NIDA,HAWAII PACIFIC UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,392060,0.11304276041447972

The Regional Research and Training Center includes talented faculty and staff from Oregon Health & Science Center and University of California, San Francisco as well as leaders of affiliated healthcare partners providing integrated primary care and substance use disorder treatment. The Node was created in 2010 as an amalgam of two CTN Nodes--California-Arizona and Oregon/Hawaii (a charter member of the CTN). The Node was highly successful, during the current award, participating in 10 CTN trials, co-leading two of these and leading one; reporting results of CTN main studies, ancillary, and research using the CTN platform in 100+ publications, and actively disseminating evidence- based practices in 200 presentations. Node investigators also sought and received awards for 10 studies that used the CTN as a platform for research. Eight WS Node healthcare programs recruited over 1,300 participants into CTN studies. In the coming grant period the Node expands to include three national and regional primary care and HIV primary care research networks: OCHIN, the HIV Research Network, and the Oregon Rural Practice-Based Research Network (ORPRN). The Node retains core addiction treatment centers experienced in CTN protocols and exploits their links with primary care: Adapt (Roseburg, OR), CODA (Portland, OR) HealthRIGHT 360 (San Francisco, CA), La Frontera (Tucson, AZ), NARA (Portland, OR), and Signal Behavioral Health Network (Denver, CO). The Node's research agenda proposes study concepts that evaluate three strategies to integrate and enhance addiction treatment within healthcare settings. Study 1 builds a patient registry for HCV infection and tests a multi-contact brief intervention for alcohol use. Study 2 extends the registry testing a candidate therapeutic HIV vaccine. Study 3, a test of reverse integration (primary care clinicians in addiction treatment settings), assesses naloxone distribution and education to reduce fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses and measures impact on return to use. Finally the WS Node continues to use the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Node has the potential to accelerate the advancement of integrated primary care and addiction in the coming years.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This renewal application to conduct research in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network has broad public health implications focused on developing and testing ways to better treat medical problems and addiction through integrated care. The project will conduct clinical trials of treatments for drug use disorders in the context of primary care addressing hepatitis C, HIV, and opioid overdose--topics of urgent national importance. This research can accelerate the advancement of providing integrated treatments for medical problems and addiction in the coming years.            ",Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse

"Social Networks and HIV Risk Behaviors of Special Populations of Drug Users DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this resubmitted K02 application is to further develop Dr. Carrie Oser's productive independent research career and to augment her research focus on HIV, substance abuse treatment, crime, and health disparities by gaining new training on social networks and HIV intervention development. The K02 builds upon her focus on special populations, including both rural drug users and African American drug users. The proposed training goals will provide new instruction in social networks, HIV intervention development, and the responsible conduct of research. The specific aims are: (1) to identify HIV and HCV risk and longitudinal changes in risk in the social networks of 503 rural out-of-treatment drug using women, as compared to men; and (2) to examine the effect of social networks, including structure (e.g., size, density), function (e.g., emotional and instrument support), and content (e.g., attitudes towards physicians), on HIV and HCV risk behaviors and health services utilization among African American drug using women, as compared to men, across criminal justice status. This significant and innovative study will have strong public healt impacts and will support NIDA's Health Disparities Initiative because of its potential to contribut to our understanding of the cultural and social network correlates of health disparities among both rural and African American drug users. In addition, this study improves upon the methodological limitations of previous research findings by examining various social networks (e.g., egocentric, dyadic, and sociocentric) and using longitudinal data in multilevel models. This proposed project will allow for a practical application of the substantive knowledge and analytical skills acquired from the K02 training activities and will ultimately culminate in the development of forthcoming investigator initiated NIDA grant applications. Specifically, these findings will be used as a foundation for future HIV social networks based intervention to increase special populations' use of preventative health care and subsequently reduce the need for expensive medical services, as well as to decrease HIV risk behaviors including drug use, unprotected sex, and recidivism. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is significant to the public health field because of its potential to understand the individual, cultural, and social network factors associated with HI and HCV risk behaviors among two special populations - rural drug users and African American drug users. These findings will be used as a foundation for developing social network based HIV interventions to increase special populations' use of preventative health care and subsequently reduce the need for expensive medical services, as well as to decrease HIV risk behaviors including drug use, unprotected sex, and recidivism.",Social Networks and HIV Risk Behaviors of Special Populations of Drug Users,8867192,K02DA035116,"['Accounting ', ' Attitude ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Data Collection ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Kentucky ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Roxicodone ', ' Oxycontin ', ' Oxycodone SR ', ' Oxycodeinon ', ' Morphinan-6-one, 4,5-epoxy-14-hydroxy-3-methoxy-17-methyl-, (5alpha)- ', ' Dihydrohydroxycodeinone ', ' Oxycodone ', ' Physicians ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Prisons ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Training Activity ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Social Network ', ' career ', ' density ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' HCV ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' Training ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Spirituality ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Rural ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Drug user ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' SNAP ', ' S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Special Population ', ' named group ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' recidivism ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' probation ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Emotional ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' K02 Award ', ' Independent Scientist Award ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' Instruction ', ' willingness ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' application in practice ', ' practical application ', ' Network-based ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' injection drug use ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,K02,2015,115827,0.1196814521075345
"Southern Ohio Prevents Hepatitis Project (StOPHeP) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to develop an integrated comprehensive approach for detection, prevention, linkage to care and treatment for hepatitis C (HCV) among young adults (18-30 years old) who have a history of injection drug use (people who inject drugs, PWID) and live in 21 non-urban southern Ohio counties. We will accomplish this by collaborating with addiction treatment providers, public health agencies, and syringe exchange programs in the target areas to identify, test, refer and link PWID to prevention and treatment services. The target area includes 21 suburban (large fringe metro, small metro) and rural (micropolitian, non-core) counties in southern Ohio, 18 of which are classified as Appalachian. To develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to address the high prevalence of HCV in southern Ohio, we will 1) identify and describe the demographic characteristics and risk behaviors and injection networks of young non-urban PWID, and test them for HCV, hepatitis B (HBV) and HIV; 2) use Peer Navigators to link young non-urban PWID to addiction treatment programs and to primary care, mental health and specialty treatment (infectious diseases, hepatology), including linkage to health insurance through the Affordable Care Act and expanded Ohio Medicaid; 3) use Peer Navigators to provide education on safe injection practices to prevent hepatitis and HIV; and link PWID to syringe exchange programs as available in target communities; 4) use a closed social networking site (SNS) to provide peer-facilitated support for the uninfected prevention group (Prevention Room) and for the linkage-to-care group for PWID with HBV, HCV and/or HIV infection (Treatment Room); available both online and via smartphone; and 5) perform follow-up assessment and re-testing of study participants for HCV within 12 months of study entry to determine rates of new HCV infection and reinfection after successful treatment. Since the majority of the target counties are in Appalachia, this proposal will address healthcare inequities that are endemic to this region, and will provide data on which to base future public health initiatives to reduce HCV among young non-urban PWID. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Injection drug use (IDU) among young adults in rural areas and the resultant epidemic of chronic hepatitis C has become a significant public health problem, but there are few data about the demographics and risk behaviors of rural IDUs to inform public health policies and practice. The use of Peer Navigators and social media will enable us to provide peer support for isolated individuals and ensure study retention and linkage to care. Moreover, linkage to prevention, drug treatment and medical care including infectious disease care for chronic viral infections  will provide data on the outcomes of these efforts in a rural setting.",Southern Ohio Prevents Hepatitis Project (StOPHeP),8917030,U18PS004566,[''],NCHHSTP,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,U18,2015,354447,0.07656359361115665
"Brief intervention for drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV/HCV DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this study is to reduce risk behaviors and increase health and behavioral health service utilization among disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV and HCV. This project has potential to make a significant contribution to science by advancing knowledge about the health disparities, high-risk behaviors (injection drug use, sex risk), and service utilization of this high-risk, vulnerable, an understudied group of women during a time of emerging and significant public health risk in an Appalachian rural setting. This project will incorporate standardized screening (NIDA-modified ASSIST) to identify high-risk rural women drug users from jails, including injectors. Consenting women (N=350) will be asked to participate in a baseline interview, and will then be randomly assigned to one of two study groups: (1) HIV Education (HIV- Ed n=175) which includes the NIDA standard pre and post-test counseling, HIV and HCV rapid testing, and an information packet on existing community drug abuse and HIV/HCV resources; or (2) Motivational Interviewing- based HIV Risk Reduction (MI-HIV n=175) which, in addition to what is received in the HIV-Ed group, also includes an evidence-based brief intervention for high-risk women focused on an individualized plan for enhancing motivation to reduce risk behaviors and to use health and behavioral health services in the community. Specific aims include: (1) to compare the effectiveness of an evidence-based HIV risk reduction intervention (MI-HIV) to HIV Education (NIDA Standard) in reducing sex risk behaviors, injection practices, and drug use among a culturally unique sample of disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV and HCV; and (2) to examine MI-HIV Intervention engagement as a predictor of community health and behavioral health service utilization (including drug treatment and mental health) at follow-up among disadvantaged, drug- using rural women at high risk for HIV and HCV. This project is innovative because it 1) targets a high-risk and understudied group of women, 2) uses brief intervention to not only reduce risk behavior but also to enhance motivation for using community health and behavioral health resources, and 3) utilizes a real-world setting to identify high-risk women drug users. The long-term goal of this study is to increase access to health and behavioral health services in order to improve the quality of health of high-risk rural women. The overall aim of this study is to reduce risk behaviors and increase health and behavioral health service utilization among disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high risk for HIV and HCV. This project has potential to make a significant contribution to science by providing knowledge about the health, risk behaviors, and service utilization of a vulnerable and understudied group of women during a time of emerging and significant public health risk in a rural Appalachian setting. Successful completion of the aims of this project will advance the delivery of a low-cost, potentially high impact intervention with implications for a number of other real world settings (such as criminal justice venues) where other disadvantaged high-risk drug users can be identified and targeted for intervention.",Brief intervention for drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV/HCV,8868967,R01DA033866,"['Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' Counseling ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Injections ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Interview ', ' Kentucky ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Random Selection ', ' Random Allocation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Walkers ', ' Woman ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' HCV ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Rural ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Staging ', ' Drug user ', ' Opiates ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' treatment planning ', ' Participant ', ' high risk behavior ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' drug resource ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Jail ', ' Consent ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' comparison group ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' service utilization ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' prescription opiate ', ' screening ', ' injection drug use ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2015,537382,0.12069110669681299
"Drug abuse and jobs: racial disparities in labor force participation and outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project addresses the impact of problem drug use (defined as frequency of use, misuse, and dependence) on labor force participation and job-related problems in a nationally representative longitudinal sample of United States adults. A key objective is to investigate racial/ethnic disparities in these associations. Both the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Outcomes Measure and the NIDA Clinical Trials Network have identified employment as an area in need of improved research and intervention. Yet, important gaps remain in our understanding of the population-level impact of problem drug use on labor force participation and the extent to which this impact is disproportionately shouldered by race/ethnic minorities. Also, it remains to be shown if and how much recovery from problem drug use improves employment outcomes for all workers.  Research evidence shows that racial/ethnic minorities are more likely to have higher unemployment rates and unfair labor market experiences. Also, they suffer more social consequences, such as greater likelihood of involvement with the child welfare or criminal justice systems when they misuse, abuse or are dependent on drugs. However, it is unclear whether these disproportionate consequences of problem drug use extend to, or contribute to, the observed racial/ethnic disparities in employment outcomes. The proposed study answers these questions using the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a nationally representative household survey with an oversample of racial/ethnic minority adults (n=43,093 wave 1 and n=34,653 followed up in wave 2). NESARC collects detailed consumption information on timing and quantities of alcohol, marijuana, stimulants, opioids and depressants. The Specific Aims are:  1: To investigate the impact of problem drug use on labor force participation, to determine whether this impact differs among racial/ethnic minorities, and to evaluate whether recovery from problem drug use can mitigate this impact. We hypothesize that problem drug use will be negatively associated with labor force participation and that Black, Native American/Alaskan Native and Hispanic individuals will be disproportionately affected by these adverse effects. We also hypothesize that recovery from problem drug use will be associated with improved labor force participation at wave 2, but racial/ethnic minorities will benefit less from the positive effects of recovery.  2: To investigat, among labor force participants, the impact of problem drug use on employment outcomes and to investigate racial/ethnic disparities. Our hypotheses are that problem drug use will be associated with job loss and job-related conflict, and racial/ethnic minorities will be disproportionately affected by these effects. Impact: Determining the extent of racial/ethnic disparities in the job consequences of problem drug use is necessary to guide future work to uncover and address mechanisms underlying these disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will identify which drug use phenotypes across the spectrum of problem use are most strongly associated with adverse job outcomes. This will enable more refined targeting of drug abuse programs and workplace interventions to mitigate these outcomes. Also, determining the extent of racial/ethnic disparities in the job-related consequences of problem drug use and whether or not recovery can improve job outcomes among drug users is necessary to guide researchers, program planners and policy makers.            ",Drug abuse and jobs: racial disparities in labor force participation and outcomes,8804066,R03DA038697,"['Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Workplace ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Opioid ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' tobacco abuse ', ' Native Americans ', ' Staging ', ' Drug user ', ' programs ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Dependence ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' experience ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Performance ', ' intervention program ', ' Participant ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' prevent drug use ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Occupational Epidemiology ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' labor force participation ', ' health economics ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' economic outcome ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' clinical practice ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Child Welfare ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Household ', ' Labor Forces ', ' marijuana ', ' Marihuana ', ' Marketing ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prejudice ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Shoulder ', ' Sociology ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' United States ', ' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' SAMHSA ', ' United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' ']",NIDA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R03,2015,80750,0.21434616884473773

"Comparative Effectiveness Research Diffusion and Mental Health Care Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) compares benefits and risks of different treatments. However, little is known about the impact of large-scale CER implementation as conceived in the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) on equity in health care across racial/ethnic groups. Identifying the influence of FDA risk warnings on disparities in psychotropic drug use provides a platform to understand how CER will influence disparities in certain situations. Disparity methods have typically not taken into account specific recommendations and warnings on effectiveness and safety. With the advent of the ACA and continued concern over persistent disparities, it is imperative that disparities research continues to evolve to incorporate lessons learned from CER.  We capitalize upon time trends in warnings and advisories to understand disparities in diffusion with the intention of identifying policies tht might avert the negative equity consequences of incorporating CER into routine practice. Specifically, we 1) Track changes in antidepressant use among youth and antipsychotic drug use among youth and adults by racial/ethnic group as they are influenced by CER-generated risk warnings and advisories; 2) Assess whether specific information in FDA warnings influenced disparity trends in a) treatments recommended by CER-generated evidence (e.g., fluoxetine use and metabolic screening for antipsychotic users); and b) psychotropic drug use that is potentially harmful (e.g., olanzapine use); and 3) Identify how provider characteristics an HMO enrollment act as mechanisms that underlie the differential diffusion of CER via health risk warnings.  We implement the Institute of Medicine (IOM) definition of healthcare disparities in order to capture trends in disparities over time, overlaying timelines of warnings and recommendations related to antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs. We adapt IOM methods by decomposing disparities in overall drug use into disparities in specific categories of use mentioned by FDA warnings as carrying particular risk or benefit. If we find racial/ethnic disparities in diffusion of risk warnings and advisories, this suggests policymakers should focus on improving uptake of CER among minorities. If we identify that certain providers and HMO membership influences disparities in diffusion, this will lead to recommendations for policymakers of actionable policies to avert the negative equity consequences of incorporating CER into routine practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this proposed project, we intend to examine whether specific information in FDA warnings influenced disparity trends in psychotropic drug use and mental health care and to identify how provider characteristics and HMO enrollment act as mechanisms that underlie the differential diffusion of CER via health risk warnings. Identifying the influence of FDA risk warnings on trends in psychotropic drug use and related health care provides a platform to understand how CER will influence disparities and will help us to assess whether information regarding the risks and benefits of medications are being equitably disseminated. Our examination of how an increased reliance on CER will likely influence disparities in treatment after health care reform will provide policymakers with actionable information that might avert the negative equity consequences of incorporating CER into routine practice.",Comparative Effectiveness Research Diffusion and Mental Health Care Disparities,8882222,R01HS021486,[''],AHRQ,CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE,R01,2015,249153,0.13187221068872973
"Southern Ohio Prevents Hepatitis Project (StOPHeP) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to develop an integrated comprehensive approach for detection, prevention, linkage to care and treatment for hepatitis C (HCV) among young adults (18-30 years old) who have a history of injection drug use (people who inject drugs, PWID) and live in 21 non-urban southern Ohio counties. We will accomplish this by collaborating with addiction treatment providers, public health agencies, and syringe exchange programs in the target areas to identify, test, refer and link PWID to prevention and treatment services. The target area includes 21 suburban (large fringe metro, small metro) and rural (micropolitian, non-core) counties in southern Ohio, 18 of which are classified as Appalachian. To develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to address the high prevalence of HCV in southern Ohio, we will 1) identify and describe the demographic characteristics and risk behaviors and injection networks of young non-urban PWID, and test them for HCV, hepatitis B (HBV) and HIV; 2) use Peer Navigators to link young non-urban PWID to addiction treatment programs and to primary care, mental health and specialty treatment (infectious diseases, hepatology), including linkage to health insurance through the Affordable Care Act and expanded Ohio Medicaid; 3) use Peer Navigators to provide education on safe injection practices to prevent hepatitis and HIV; and link PWID to syringe exchange programs as available in target communities; 4) use a closed social networking site (SNS) to provide peer-facilitated support for the uninfected prevention group (Prevention Room) and for the linkage-to-care group for PWID with HBV, HCV and/or HIV infection (Treatment Room); available both online and via smartphone; and 5) perform follow-up assessment and re-testing of study participants for HCV within 12 months of study entry to determine rates of new HCV infection and reinfection after successful treatment. Since the majority of the target counties are in Appalachia, this proposal will address healthcare inequities that are endemic to this region, and will provide data on which to base future public health initiatives to reduce HCV among young non-urban PWID. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Injection drug use (IDU) among young adults in rural areas and the resultant epidemic of chronic hepatitis C has become a significant public health problem, but there are few data about the demographics and risk behaviors of rural IDUs to inform public health policies and practice. The use of Peer Navigators and social media will enable us to provide peer support for isolated individuals and ensure study retention and linkage to care. Moreover, linkage to prevention, drug treatment and medical care including infectious disease care for chronic viral infections  will provide data on the outcomes of these efforts in a rural setting.",Southern Ohio Prevents Hepatitis Project (StOPHeP),9102800,U18PS004566,[''],NCHHSTP,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,U18,2016,300000,0.07656359361115665
"Drug abuse and jobs: racial disparities in labor force participation and outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project addresses the impact of problem drug use (defined as frequency of use, misuse, and dependence) on labor force participation and job-related problems in a nationally representative longitudinal sample of United States adults. A key objective is to investigate racial/ethnic disparities in these associations. Both the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Outcomes Measure and the NIDA Clinical Trials Network have identified employment as an area in need of improved research and intervention. Yet, important gaps remain in our understanding of the population-level impact of problem drug use on labor force participation and the extent to which this impact is disproportionately shouldered by race/ethnic minorities. Also, it remains to be shown if and how much recovery from problem drug use improves employment outcomes for all workers.  Research evidence shows that racial/ethnic minorities are more likely to have higher unemployment rates and unfair labor market experiences. Also, they suffer more social consequences, such as greater likelihood of involvement with the child welfare or criminal justice systems when they misuse, abuse or are dependent on drugs. However, it is unclear whether these disproportionate consequences of problem drug use extend to, or contribute to, the observed racial/ethnic disparities in employment outcomes. The proposed study answers these questions using the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a nationally representative household survey with an oversample of racial/ethnic minority adults (n=43,093 wave 1 and n=34,653 followed up in wave 2). NESARC collects detailed consumption information on timing and quantities of alcohol, marijuana, stimulants, opioids and depressants. The Specific Aims are:  1: To investigate the impact of problem drug use on labor force participation, to determine whether this impact differs among racial/ethnic minorities, and to evaluate whether recovery from problem drug use can mitigate this impact. We hypothesize that problem drug use will be negatively associated with labor force participation and that Black, Native American/Alaskan Native and Hispanic individuals will be disproportionately affected by these adverse effects. We also hypothesize that recovery from problem drug use will be associated with improved labor force participation at wave 2, but racial/ethnic minorities will benefit less from the positive effects of recovery.  2: To investigat, among labor force participants, the impact of problem drug use on employment outcomes and to investigate racial/ethnic disparities. Our hypotheses are that problem drug use will be associated with job loss and job-related conflict, and racial/ethnic minorities will be disproportionately affected by these effects. Impact: Determining the extent of racial/ethnic disparities in the job consequences of problem drug use is necessary to guide future work to uncover and address mechanisms underlying these disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will identify which drug use phenotypes across the spectrum of problem use are most strongly associated with adverse job outcomes. This will enable more refined targeting of drug abuse programs and workplace interventions to mitigate these outcomes. Also, determining the extent of racial/ethnic disparities in the job-related consequences of problem drug use and whether or not recovery can improve job outcomes among drug users is necessary to guide researchers, program planners and policy makers.",Drug abuse and jobs: racial disparities in labor force participation and outcomes,9020221,R03DA038697,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' child well being ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Child Welfare ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Household ', ' Labor Forces ', ' marihuana ', ' Marijuana ', ' Marketing ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prejudice ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Shoulder ', ' Sociology ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' United States ', ' United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' SAMHSA ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' problematic alcohol use ', ' problematic alcohol consumption ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Opioid ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' tobacco abuse ', ' Native Americans ', ' Staging ', ' Drug user ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' Dependence ', ' System ', ' Remission ', ' Disease remission ', ' experience ', ' Alaskan Native American ', ' Performance ', ' intervention program ', ' Participant ', ' Program Announcement ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' prevent drug use ', ' prevent drug addiction ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Occupation Epidemiology ', ' Occupational Epidemiology ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' labor force participation ', ' health economics ', ' Clinical Trials Network ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' economic outcome ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' population based ', ' clinical practice ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' ']",NIDA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R03,2016,79942,0.21434616884473773
"Stress and Drug Use Vulnerability in the African American Community DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The impacts that drug addictions have on health disparities that adversely affect African Americans are grossly understudied. While there is strong evidence linking drug abuse to poor health and problem behaviors in the African American community, the progression of drug abuse is inconsistent (i.e., relatively late initiation and heavy use in the 30s) with national norms and remains unclear. Exposure to chronic stress and the subsequent activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been connected to drug addictions and poor health outcomes. This association is of particular importance since residents in these communities are exposed to many of the risk factors associated with the onset of drug abuse: familial risk, deprived social environment, unemployment, substandard education, low-to-no socioeconomic status, and enduring exposure to experiences of racism and discrimination. Repeated exposure to environmental stressors will lead to 'wear-and-tear' on the body's regulatory system and have profound implications on HPA functioning and the subsequent risk of developing an addiction. This study will pursue three primary aims: (1) Investigate HPA reactivity to acute stress as a predictor of current drug use severity. (2) Investigate trajectories of HPA regulation (level and circadian rhythm) as a predicto of drug use vulnerability across time. (3) Investigate delay discounting as a moderator between trajectories of HPA regulation and drug use vulnerability across time. This study will enroll 350 African American adults (ages 18-21) who reside in the southeastern U.S. and utilize a prospective longitudinal research design that consists of a laboratory assessment involving the Trier Social Stress Test, three in-home assessments that include clinical interviews and behavioral tasks, and six internet assessments that track drug use and related risk factors across a 2-year period. Primary independent variables include environmental stressors, stress-related biomarkers (i.e., salivary cortical, salivary DHEA, heart rate variability, and galvanic skn resistance), and delay discounting. Primary dependent variables include drug use, severity of drug use disorders, and drug use consequences. This study is highly innovative for three primary reasons: (1) A longitudinal research design will be used for the first time to investigate trajectories of HPA regulation as a predictor of drug use vulnerability; (2) The use of multiple indicators of the stress regulatory system, clinical interviews, and a novel behavioral task provides a more nuanced understanding of the research aims; and (3) This study focuses on an understudied population that suffers from drug-related health disparities, but are rarely included in cutting edge laboratory research. It is envisioned that this approach will uncover latent-curve trajectories of stress deregulation as a predictor of drug use vulnerability in this population. Findings from this study will identify causal mechanisms of drug addictions that will advance theory, research, prevention, and treatments aimed at addressing this growing public health problem. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of drug abuse in the African American community is often characterized by oversimplified models that are rooted in research studies that rarely include African Americans. This study will identify mechanisms that influence drug use vulnerability in at-risk African American adults who reside in the southeastern U.S. Such research is needed to develop socially and culturally informed prevention and treatment programs aimed at reducing drug-related health disparities that continue to plague African Americans.",Stress and Drug Use Vulnerability in the African American Community,8994725,R01DA034739,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' suprarenal gland ', ' Adrenals ', ' Adrenal Glands ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Belief ', ' diurnal variation ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' circadian ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Diurnal Rhythm ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Therapeutic Dehydroepiandrosterone ', ' Prasterone ', ' Dehydroisoandrosterone ', ' DHEA ', ' Androstenolone ', ' dehydroepiandrosterone ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Pituitary Nervous System ', ' Pituitary ', ' Hypophysis Cerebri ', ' Hypophysis ', ' Pituitary Gland ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Plague ', ' Psychopharmaceuticals ', ' Psychoactive Drugs ', ' Psychoactive Compound ', ' Psychoactive Agents ', ' Psychotropic Drugs ', ' Public Health ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' disability ', ' Stimulus ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Spirituality ', ' Recovery ', ' Rural ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Exposure to ', ' Severities ', ' Salivary ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' System ', ' environmental stressor ', ' experience ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' novel ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention program ', ' treatment program ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Impulsivity ', ' acute stress ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' discounting ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Trier Social Stress Test ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' heart rate variability ', ' constriction ', ' longitudinal design ', ' injury burden ', ' behavioral economics ', ' drug use vulnerability ', ' vulnerability to drug use ', ' illicit drug use ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2016,490108,0.21249262221003148

"Social Networks and HIV Risk Behaviors of Special Populations of Drug Users DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this resubmitted K02 application is to further develop Dr. Carrie Oser's productive independent research career and to augment her research focus on HIV, substance abuse treatment, crime, and health disparities by gaining new training on social networks and HIV intervention development. The K02 builds upon her focus on special populations, including both rural drug users and African American drug users. The proposed training goals will provide new instruction in social networks, HIV intervention development, and the responsible conduct of research. The specific aims are: (1) to identify HIV and HCV risk and longitudinal changes in risk in the social networks of 503 rural out-of-treatment drug using women, as compared to men; and (2) to examine the effect of social networks, including structure (e.g., size, density), function (e.g., emotional and instrument support), and content (e.g., attitudes towards physicians), on HIV and HCV risk behaviors and health services utilization among African American drug using women, as compared to men, across criminal justice status. This significant and innovative study will have strong public healt impacts and will support NIDA's Health Disparities Initiative because of its potential to contribut to our understanding of the cultural and social network correlates of health disparities among both rural and African American drug users. In addition, this study improves upon the methodological limitations of previous research findings by examining various social networks (e.g., egocentric, dyadic, and sociocentric) and using longitudinal data in multilevel models. This proposed project will allow for a practical application of the substantive knowledge and analytical skills acquired from the K02 training activities and will ultimately culminate in the development of forthcoming investigator initiated NIDA grant applications. Specifically, these findings will be used as a foundation for future HIV social networks based intervention to increase special populations' use of preventative health care and subsequently reduce the need for expensive medical services, as well as to decrease HIV risk behaviors including drug use, unprotected sex, and recidivism. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is significant to the public health field because of its potential to understand the individual, cultural, and social network factors associated with HI and HCV risk behaviors among two special populations - rural drug users and African American drug users.

"Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for Drug Abuse and HIV (Ce-PIM) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application is for a competing renewal of the Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for HIV and Drug Abuse, a NIDA P30 Center of Excellence. The number of new HIV cases in the US remains stable at 56,000 per year and continues to disproportionately affect some groups, including young men who have sex with men (YMSM), especially from racial/ethnic minorities. The purpose of this methodology center is to develop new methodologies that can be used by federal and local agencies and communities to reduce HIV incidence. Biomedical interventions and strategies, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), rapid testing for HIV and early and consistent treatment for persons who are HIV positive (Treatment as Prevention, TasP) have been shown to have high efficacy and effectiveness in reducing HIV transmission, but there remains a giant gap between what research knows and what services needed to reduce population level incidence of HIV. The major premise of this application is that the effective biomedical to reduce HIV incidence and disparities are in hand, but success will only be achieved when they are implemented in ways that meet individual, community, and health care delivery system needs. This methods proposal addresses this major gap between research and practice through implementation science and methodology, focusing on innovative ways to address the complex, mulitilevel interactions needed to implement HIV prevention programs effectively. Two Cores, an Administrative Core and an Innovative Implementation Methods Core for HIV and Drug Abuse will carry out this work.  Aim 1 is to develop innovative methods to maximize the impact of implementation research in HIV prevention. We do this through an extended set of systems science and engineering methods that focus on improving the measurement of implementation, the modeling of implementation strategies, and the testing of implementation strategies through rigorous trials. Five qualifying grants support this work.  Aim 2 is to apply these innovative methods to close the gap between existing research, policy, and practice for HIV prevention. In addition to working closely with our five qualifying grants, we work locally with municipal Departments of Public Health and the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) HIV programs to identify and prioritize gaps in knowledge, find optimal implementation strategies for reduction of HIV transmission, and design the next large implementation trials.  Aim 3 is to disseminate methods and train/mentor leaders at the intersection of HIV prevention, implementation science, and drug abuse fields to improve implementation of HIV prevention programs. This involves mentoring the early career researchers, publishing, and providing training to networks of HIV and drug abuse researchers. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are numerous rigorously evaluated prevention programs involving biomedical interventions for preventing HIV that have demonstrated impact in efficacy and effectiveness trials. Pre-exposure prophylaxis, HIV testing, and early and consistent antiretroviral treatment have high potential for preventing HIV infections, but these are yet to be implemented sufficiently in racial/ethnic minority communities. This Ce-PIM addresses the critical methods gaps that are holding back the movement of these programs from research to practice.",Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for Drug Abuse and HIV

"Vulnerability to Drug Use & HIV: Advancing Prevention for Rural African Americans The Center for Translational and Prevention Science (CTAPS) was funded in 2009 to inform the development of prevention programs for rural African American youth through investigations of gene-environment (G-E) interplay on drug use and HIV-related behavior. The proposed continuation augments CTAPS' scientific agenda to better address racial disparities in drug use and HIV-related behavior that affect rural African Americans. Emerging research suggests that exposure to chronic stress affects the functioning of inflammatory, neuroendocrine, and neurocognitive systems beginning in childhood and adolescence. The negative consequences of chronic stress affect health-related behaviors and forecast chronic diseases of aging. Emerging evidence suggests that these processes also may affect youth and young adults' development of drug misuse and HIV related behavior. The Center will sponsor a new generation of research on (a) the neuroendocrine, inflammatory, and neurocognitive pathways through which exposure to stress among rural African American youth and young adults creates vulnerabilities to drug use and HIV-related behavior, (b), the malleable risk and protective processes that affect underlying vulnerability mechanisms , and (c) the translation of findings into new and refined preventive interventions for youth in general and rural African American youth in particular. The CTAPS will pursue these scientific goals via providing infrastructure for three support cores (Inflammation/Neuroendocrine, Neurocognitive, Biostatistics) that will enrich data from data from Core projects and pilot projects and a Pilot Core. CTAPS will facilitate communication among Center-affiliated investigators, support core directors, and core project Pis; oversee administration of Center-wide budgets and operations; provide infrastructure and administrative support for three support cores and a Pilot Core. CTAPS will spur progress via a transdisciplinary work group system designed to facilitate transdisciplinary collaboration and to organize the allocation of Center resources and disseminate research findings to multiple stakeholders including researchers, policy makers, educational organizations, and the public. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed Center is designed to investigate how chronic stress that rural African American's experience in childhood and adolescence affects drug misuse and HIV-related behavior in young adulthood.

"Health Consequences of Drug Use and IPV Trajectories for Young Latinas ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Few empirical studies have documented the life trajectories of gang-affiliated adolescent females and the long- term health consequences of adolescent drug use and partner violence victimization. The purpose of this study is to identify and determine how distinct drug use and intimate partner violence victimization trajectories that emerge in adolescence through young adulthood contribute to physical and mental health outcomes among Mexican American women within the context of a highly disadvantaged community. This group of women are particularly vulnerable given they have low rates of access and utilization of health care, are the most likely age group to be uninsured, and represent a nexus of risk, vulnerability and potentially high costs to communities given their reproductive and sexual health stage of life. This application proposes a 15 year follow up of a cohort of Mexican American adolescent females previously identified in a CDC funded study who were affiliated with male gang members during their adolescence and involved in high rates of drug use and victims of intimate partner violence. Building upon the research teams previous studies and using analytical tools from the theory of gender and power and social bonding theory, this application will implement a concurrent mixed methods nested design approach to provide a comprehensive understanding of the long-term consequences of drug use and IPV. The sample will consist of 300 young adult Mexican-American females. The specific aims for this study are: 1) determine the prevalence of physical (cardiovascular and metabolic risk markers and STI infection) and mental (depression, PTSD, anxiety/stress) health outcomes; 2) identify and characterize distinct drug use and IPV trajectories from adolescence through young adulthood; 3) determine whether sexual relationship power and family social bonds during distinct age-graded stages alter drug use and IPV trajectories and health outcomes; and 4) characterize qualitatively the culture and community context and their influence on drug use and IPV trajectories over the life course. This research will have an important positive impact by identifying women who are at the highest risk for developing harmful drug and IPV trajectories as they transition into young adulthood. In doing this, we will lay the foundation for identifying critical points of behavioral intervention during key age-graded periods as well as culturally and contextually appropriate values and strategies that will reduce health disparities among similar high-risk female populations that have gone underrepresented in existing research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This application seek a comprehensive understanding of the long term health consequences of drug use and intimate partner violence victimization physical and mental health outcomes among a vulnerable cohort of Mexican-American females recruited over 15 years ago who were affiliated with male gang members during their adolescence. The study will provide a unique opportunity to investigate detrimental life trajectories contributing t the prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic risk markers, infection, depression, PTSD, anxiety and stress within a marginalized and underserved community context. Findings will contribute to policy discourse that can lead to the development of innovative public health programs and campaigns that will reduce health disparities among minority women.

The proposed training objectives are: (1) to receive training in the epidemiology of drug abuse, mental health, and HIV as they relate to health disparities among African Americans; (2) to further develop expertise in research with special populations, biostatistics, and advanced quantitative analyses including non-linear, categorical models, and structural equation modeling; (3) to use the data collected in the proposed research plan as pilot data for an R01 research proposal. The specified training goals are aligned with the research aims and compliment the clinical experience of the candidate. Dr. Stevens-Watkins will be sponsored by her established mentors, Drs. Carl Leukefeld and Carrie Oser, both with expertise in drug abuse and HIV research. Of high significance, HIV has recently been termed a ""crisis"" in the African American community. The overall goal of the proposed research plan is to better understand the complex and dynamic relationship between drug use, mental health, and HIV risk among African American male prisoners nearing community re-entry. The specific aims are (1) to explore drug use, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and HIV risk behaviors among African American male inmates by conducting a thorough literature review and devising an analytical model using biostatics multivariate analytic techniques with available data; (2) to identify prevalence, incidence, and predictors of drug use disorders, anxiety, depressive disorders and HIV sexual risk behaviors among 205 incarcerated African American men; (3) to examine the knowledge, patterns, and perceived cultural and community barriers to utilizing individual and health resources and their relationship to substance abuse recovery and HIV risk behaviors among 205 African American men upon release from prison. Baseline data will be collected in prison and follow-up data collection will occur when participants have been released in the community after 3-months. The proposed research plan will offer HIV testing and counseling to an at-risk population that has historically been difficult to engage in research and HIV testing, subsequently significantly impacting public health by possibly preventing the spread of HIV. The candidate's immediate career goals include published manuscripts and R01 funding by the end of K08 funding, with an ultimate career goal of becoming an independent clinical drug abuse researcher. This proposal includes an outstanding mentoring team, as well as a feasible training and research plan utilizing resources offered by both Spalding University and the University of Kentucky. The proposed project has significant public health implications for reducing the spread of HIV among the African American community by offering testing and by targeting men exiting prison, re-entering the community. The proposed project will generate an improved understanding of the complex relationship between drug use, mental health, and HIV risk among an at-risk group.","African American Offenders: Drug Use, Mental Health and HIV Risk",9058010,K08DA032296,"['Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' career track ', ' career pathway ', ' career interest ', ' career aspiration ', ' Career Path ', ' Career Choice ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Housing ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Kentucky ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Structural Models ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' jail inmate ', ' correctional institution resident ', ' Prison Inmates ', ' Prisoner ', ' Prisons ', ' Psychologist ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Writing ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Phase ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' racism ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Development Plans ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Review Literature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Equation ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' experience ', ' impression ', ' Special Population ', ' named group ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Participant ', ' criminal offender ', ' offender ', ' intravenous drug use ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' correctional system ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' community re-entry ', ' community reentry ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' drug testing ', ' drug detection ', ' high risk ', ' public health research ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,K08,2016,144850,0.1550195541722535
"Yale Drug Abuse, Addiction, and HIV Research Scholars (Yale-DAHRS) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a critical need to develop a diverse pool of highly trained clinician scholars to foster the development of biomedical, behavioral and clinical research related to drug abuse, addiction, and HIV prevention and treatment in general medical settings. Patients who abuse substances are more likely to be seen in general medical settings such as emergency departments (ED), general medical primary care clinics and inpatient wards, HIV and adolescent health clinics, and women's health centers. These patients often present with a complex array of acute consequences and complications (e.g. intoxication, overdose, withdrawal, trauma and infectious diseases) of substance use as well as chronic conditions such as HIV disease, hepatitis, pulmonary and cardiovascular disease. Objectives: The Yale-Drug Abuse, Addiction, and HIV Research Scholars (DAHRS) program provides a comprehensive three year post-doctorate, interdisciplinary, Mentored Career Development Program to improve drug abuse, addiction, and HIV medical outcomes integrating prevention and treatment in general medical settings including ED, primary care, HIV, adolescent, and women's health clinics.

Career Development Plan: Yale-DAHRS is a three year research training program that will prepare a total of six clinician investigators for careers focusing on drug abuse, addiction, and HIV in general medical settings during its first funding cycle. Scholars will earn the Master in Health Sciences degree, combining rigorous training in research methodology, statistics and design with seminars in topics related to drug abuse, addiction, and HIV content, leadership, grant writing and responsible conduct of research. Candidates will complete published mentored research project(s) and prepare an application for the next career step; i.e. NIH R21, R03, R15, R34 mechanism. The collaboration of the multidisciplinary faculty and the combined robust strengths of two principal investigators from Emergency and Internal Medicine, both with extensive experience mentoring and as independent funded investigators will drive the Yale-DAHRS program. Potential Research Projects: Multiple research projects are ""shovel ready"" for Scholar training and can be completed within our allotted time frame, such as secondary data analysis using national large datasets e.g. VA Aging Cohort (HIV); risk factors, prevention and treatment of prescription drug abuse, office-based treatment of opioid dependence with buprenorphine, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, creation of cost effective evaluation models for patients with drug abuse, addiction and HIV including prescription drug abuse; investigation of gender and racial/ethnic disparities in identification and treatment interventions and outcomes; evaluation of screening, and treatment initiation in special populations (i.e. adolescent-elderly, veterans, incarcerated, HIV); comparison of models of screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) delivery by providers and other innovative technologies; effectiveness and implementation of SBIRT science in general medicine practice with acute and chronic medical complexities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Drug abuse, addiction, and HIV are significant public health issues, as they affect the health and well-being of a large portion of the population; have substantial negative health outcomes on individuals; and are extremely costly to the health care system. An investment in research to improve substance abuse and medical health outcomes is greatly needed. The proposed Yale-Drug Abuse, Addiction, and HIV Research Scholars (DAHRS) program focusing on general medical settings with patients throughout the life cycle will provide a three year post-doctoral, interdisciplinary, Mentored Career Development Program training six clinician-scientists for independent research careers in the field of drug abuse, addiction, and HIV through integration of prevention and treatment in general medical settings.","Yale Drug Abuse, Addiction, and HIV Research Scholars (Yale-DAHRS)",9084527,K12DA033312,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', '

"Vulnerability to Drug Use & HIV: Advancing Prevention for Rural African Americans The Center for Translational and Prevention Science (CTAPS) was funded in 2009 to inform the development of prevention programs for rural African American youth through investigations of gene-environment (G-E) interplay on drug use and HIV-related behavior. The proposed continuation augments CTAPS' scientific agenda to better address racial disparities in drug use and HIV-related behavior that affect rural African Americans. Emerging research suggests that exposure to chronic stress affects the functioning of inflammatory, neuroendocrine, and neurocognitive systems beginning in childhood and adolescence. The negative consequences of chronic stress affect health-related behaviors and forecast chronic diseases of aging. Emerging evidence suggests that these processes also may affect youth and young adults' development of drug misuse and HIV related behavior. The Center will sponsor a new generation of research on (a) the neuroendocrine, inflammatory, and neurocognitive pathways through which exposure to stress among rural African American youth and young adults creates vulnerabilities to drug use and HIV-related behavior, (b), the malleable risk and protective processes that affect underlying vulnerability mechanisms , and (c) the translation of findings into new and refined preventive interventions for youth in general and rural African American youth in particular. The CTAPS will pursue these scientific goals via providing infrastructure for three support cores (Inflammation/Neuroendocrine, Neurocognitive, Biostatistics) that will enrich data from data from Core projects and pilot projects and a Pilot Core. CTAPS will facilitate communication among Center-affiliated investigators, support core directors, and core project Pis; oversee administration of Center-wide budgets and operations; provide infrastructure and administrative support for three support cores and a Pilot Core. CTAPS will spur progress via a transdisciplinary work group system designed to facilitate transdisciplinary collaboration and to organize the allocation of Center resources and disseminate research findings to multiple stakeholders including researchers, policy makers, educational organizations, and the public. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed Center is designed to investigate how chronic stress that rural African American's experience in childhood and adolescence affects drug misuse and HIV-related behavior in young adulthood. The Center's work will contribute to the development of prevention programs that target vulnerabilities to drug use and HIV related behavior that may be developing ""under the skin"" in phsyiolobical and neurological systems.",Vulnerability to Drug Use & HIV: Advancing Prevention for Rural African Americans,9306505,P30DA027827,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Behavior ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Budgets ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cataloging ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Environment ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Inflammation ', ' Institutes ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Science ', ' seed ', ' Plant Zygotes ', ' Plant Embryos ', ' Seeds ', ' Stress ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Fostering ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Catalogs ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' experience ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' outreach ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' HIV risk ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Skin ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Biostatistics Core ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Collection ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' minority health ', ' Instruction ', ' implementation research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' malleable risk ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' operation ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' drug use vulnerability ', ' vulnerability to drug use ', ' drug misuse ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,P30,2016,100000,0.11683494687913223
"Couple HIV prevention for drug-involved male offenders: An Effectiveness Trial DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study responds to PA-09-236 entitled ""HIV/AIDS, Drug Use, and Vulnerable Populations."" This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will rigorously evaluate the implementation, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a couple-based integrated HIV/STI and drug abuse prevention intervention (Connect II) with drug-involved male offenders charged with misdemeanors and their primary female sexual partners, implemented by frontline providers in Criminal Court, Community Court or Probation (CCP) sites in the Bronx, NY, compared to CCP standard treatment of care services (TAU). The primary outcomes are biologically confirmed sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and self-reported condom use. This study will yield important data on implementation factors associated with effectiveness of the proposed intervention in real world resource-constrained criminal justice settings. The proposed CCP study sites are located in the South Bronx, the poorest Congressional District in the U.S. with 96% of residents identifying as Black or Latino. The South Bronx has an HIV prevalence rate of 2.6%. Research has found that 12% of men on probation in New York City are HIV positive. Though the criminal justice system is recognized as the epicenter of the epidemic in the U.S., few, if any, HIV prevention interventions have been developed for the huge number of male offenders under community supervision who represent 90% of the corrections population. No HIV/STI prevention services are currently provided at the proposed CCP sites. The proposed intervention is designed to address this critical gap in services. Connect II was found to be efficacious among drug-involved couples in reducing risky drug and sexual behaviors and drug use. In the proposed study we aim to advance the knowledge of implementation science by testing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Connect II delivered by frontline providers in the real world settings of CCP sites with 240 drug-involved male offenders and their female partners (N=480 participants). Eligible couples will be randomly assigned to either (1) a 4-session Connect II delivered to both partners together + TAU delivered to male participant alone, or (2) a TAU control condition delivered to the male participant. Repeated assessments will occur at baseline and 3, 6, and 12-months post intervention. The study will be conducted by Dr. Nabila El-Bassel, Dr. Louisa Gilbert, and an investigative team from Columbia University in collaboration with Michael Rempel from the Center for Court Innovation and the New York City Department of Probation. If found to be effective, Connect II may be scaled up in community criminal justice settings nationwide to curb the spread of HIV/STIs and to reduce HIV disparities in heavily impacted communities like the South Bronx. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This study addresses the significant public health threat of HIV and other STIs among drug- involved male offenders under community supervision and their female partners. This study will evaluate the implementation, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a brief couple-based HIV and drug abuse prevention intervention for drug-involved male offenders and their female partners delivered by frontline providers in Criminal/Community Court and Probation sites in the South Bronx, the poorest congressional district in the U.S. If found to be effective, the proposed brief intervention may be scaled up to community criminal justice sites nationwide to curb the spread of HIV/STIs and reduce HIV disparities.",Couple HIV prevention for drug-involved male offenders: An Effectiveness Trial,9128572,R01DA033168,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Charge ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Couples ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' Health ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Institutes ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', ' Medicine ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' New York City ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex partner ', ' Sexual Partners ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Latino ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' court ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Collaborations ', ' Letters ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Prevent infection ', ' Infection prevention ', ' Consult ', ' Services ', ' professor ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' prevention service ', ' recidivism ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' probation ', ' criminal offender ', ' offender ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief intervention ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' prevent drug use ', ' prevent drug addiction ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effectiveness analyses ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' post intervention ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' efficacy research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' probationer ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' demographics ', ' implementation science ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' standard care ', ' standard treatment ', ' ']",NIDA,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2016,634839,0.06416710644856985
"Evaluating the Effectiveness of an eHealth EBI for Latino Youth in Primary Care Hispanic adolescents in the U.S. experience significant health disparities, particularly as it relates to drug use, unsafe sexual behaviors and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In spite of these disparities, a paucity of effective preventive interventions exist for Hispanic adolescents, and even fewer have been disseminated widely (IOM/NRC, 2009). Given that primary care settings are increasingly becoming the entry-point through which parents bring youth with behavioral health concerns, adolescent primary care settings represent ideal, yet underutilized, settings in which to disseminate evidence-based preventive interventions. Preventive interventions which target risk and protective factors within the family, the most proximal and fundamental social system influencing human behavior, have been found to be among the most efficacious interventions in preventing and reducing drug use and sexual risk behaviors.  Familias Unidas is a Hispanic-specific, family-based intervention found to be efficacious and effective in preventing and reducing drug use, sexual risk behaviors, and self-reported STIs. Familias Unidas has been cited by the Institute of Medicine report on Preventing, Emotional, and Behavioral among Young People as ready for broad dissemination (IOM/NRC, 2009). To date, however, Familias Unidas has been only tested for efficacy and effectiveness in schools and has not been evaluated for efficacy/effectiveness in primary care. We have adapted and evaluated Familias Unidas for online delivery; successfully retaining 80% of Hispanic parents and their youth (recruited from schools) in the online, eHealth adaptation of Familias Unidas. We have also demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of delivering eHealth Familas Unidas in primary care.  Evaluating innovative eHealth family-based interventions for Hispanic youth whose feasibility and acceptability is established in primary care settings is timely and of high public health significance. Therefore, the proposed study's overarching aim is to evaluate the relative effectiveness and cost effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas, compared to a referral to the National Institute Drug Abuse’s (NIDA) online information page for parents of Hispanic youth (referred hereafter as NIDA Online Information). To test the effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care in preventing drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and STIs in a universal sample of Hispanic youth, this study will randomize 456 Hispanic youth and their parents to eHealth Familias Unidas or to NIDA Online Information. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months post baseline. Study hypotheses are that: 1) eHealth Familias Unidas will be effective, relative to NIDA Online Information, in preventing/reducing drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and STI incidence in Hispanic adolescents over time and 2) Intervention effects will be partially mediated by family functioning for drug use and unprotected sexual behavior and by family functioning and unprotected sexual behavior for STI incidence.

"Health Consequences of Drug Use and IPV Trajectories for Young Latinas ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Few empirical studies have documented the life trajectories of gang-affiliated adolescent females and the long- term health consequences of adolescent drug use and partner violence victimization. The purpose of this study is to identify and determine how distinct drug use and intimate partner violence victimization trajectories that emerge in adolescence through young adulthood contribute to physical and mental health outcomes among Mexican American women within the context of a highly disadvantaged community. This group of women are particularly vulnerable given they have low rates of access and utilization of health care, are the most likely age group to be uninsured, and represent a nexus of risk, vulnerability and potentially high costs to communities given their reproductive and sexual health stage of life. This application proposes a 15 year follow up of a cohort of Mexican American adolescent females previously identified in a CDC funded study who were affiliated with male gang members during their adolescence and involved in high rates of drug use and victims of intimate partner violence. Building upon the research teams previous studies and using analytical tools from the theory of gender and power and social bonding theory, this application will implement a concurrent mixed methods nested design approach to provide a comprehensive understanding of the long-term consequences of drug use and IPV. The sample will consist of 300 young adult Mexican-American females. The specific aims for this study are: 1) determine the prevalence of physical (cardiovascular and metabolic risk markers and STI infection) and mental (depression, PTSD, anxiety/stress) health outcomes; 2) identify and characterize distinct drug use and IPV trajectories from adolescence through young adulthood; 3) determine whether sexual relationship power and family social bonds during distinct age-graded stages alter drug use and IPV trajectories and health outcomes; and 4) characterize qualitatively the culture and community context and their influence on drug use and IPV trajectories over the life course. This research will have an important positive impact by identifying women who are at the highest risk for developing harmful drug and IPV trajectories as they transition into young adulthood. In doing this, we will lay the foundation for identifying critical points of behavioral intervention during key age-graded periods as well as culturally and contextually appropriate values and strategies that will reduce health disparities among similar high-risk female populations that have gone underrepresented in existing research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This application seek a comprehensive understanding of the long term health consequences of drug use and intimate partner violence victimization physical and mental health outcomes among a vulnerable cohort of Mexican-American females recruited over 15 years ago who were affiliated with male gang members during their adolescence. The study will provide a unique opportunity to investigate detrimental life trajectories contributing t the prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic risk markers, infection, depression, PTSD, anxiety and stress within a marginalized and underserved community context. Findings will contribute to policy discourse that can lead to the development of innovative public health programs and campaigns that will reduce health disparities among minority women.

"Age-Varying Effects in the Epidemiology of Drug Abuse ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To improve the efficiency and efficacy of drug abuse interventions, an understanding of the age-related changes in behavior prevalences, comorbidities, and health disparities, and the evolving role of various risk factors from adolescence through middle adulthood, is crucial. Today there is an unprecedented amount of existing high-quality data that have enormous potential to shed new light on these issues. Many of these data sets are nationally representative, drawn from populations that span a wide range of ages. New methods now exist to tap those data in order to address important, new scientific questions about drug use, abuse, and dependence (drug UAD) from a developmental perspective. To this end, we propose the innovative application of the time-varying effect model (TVEM) to data from two complementary national studies of health risk behaviors: The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=20,745) and the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N=63,809). TVEM flexibly estimates behavior prevalences and associations among variables as continuous, flexible functions of age. Specifically, the specific aims for this projec are as follows. (1) To model flexible, age-varying trends in drug UAD from adolescence into middle adulthood. We will estimate rates of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and other drug use, abuse and dependence as a complex function of continuous age from ages 12 to 50. Trends will be estimated across sex and race/ethnicity to document age-varying health disparities. (2) To elucidate the age-varying role of mental health problems in the course of drug UAD from adolescence into middle adulthood. We will examine how depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation are differentially associated with drug UAD as a continuous, complex function from ages 12 to 50. (3) To estimate age-varying effects of early and concurrent risk factors on drug UAD from adolescence into middle adulthood. We will examine how and when specific risk and protective factors are associated with drug UAD from ages 12 to 50. We will consider early risk factors at the individual, parent, peer, school, and community levels, as well as concurrent factors such as marriage and parenthood. (4) To examine contributors to health disparities in drug use. To advance understanding of the developmental course of health disparities, we will examine sex and race/ethnicity as moderators of (a) age-varying comorbidities of drug UAD and mental health problems and (b) age-varying associations between risk factors and drug UAD. This project will provide knowledge about the developmental course of drug UAD and related health disparities, allowing prevention scientists and clinicians to design interventions that matc the most promising mechanisms of change to the most appropriate age period within population subgroups. To maximize the project's overall impact, we will actively disseminate this promising new analytic approach to drug abuse researchers.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Existing national data have been used extensively to advance understanding of drug use, abuse, and dependence; comorbidities with mental health problems; the role of early and concurrent risk factors; and health disparities. However, empirical studies and behavioral theory have been largely silent on how these issues evolve continuously across age. This project will apply a new data analytic approach to existing cross- sectional and panel data to gain new insight into nuanced, age-related changes from adolescence through mid-adulthood, shedding light on ways to tailor interventions to individuals to increase intervention efficiency and efficacy to reduce drug abuse and its related consequences.                ",Age-Varying Effects in the Epidemiology of Drug Abuse,9093771,R01DA039854,"['Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Employment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Health ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' marihuana ', ' Marijuana ', ' Marital Status ', ' Marriage ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Paper ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Data Quality ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Intercept ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' trend ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' attributable death ', ' attributable mortality ', ' cost ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Developmental Course ', ' adolescent health ', ' ']",NIDA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2016,223789,0.21078522912097405
"Contextualizing & responding to HIV risk behaviors among Black drug offenders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Formerly incarcerated Black drug offenders are at an elevated risk for HIV infection. Despite substantial research expressing the need for HIV prevention services for ex-offenders post-release, this population has limited access to quality programming and services related to HIV risk reduction. This K01 application seeks to inform and adapt an HIV risk reduction intervention to address the needs of formerly incarcerated Black drug offenders who are being released from prisons in the New York City metropolitan area. This application supports the Principal Investigator's interest in becoming an independent behavioral scientist specializing in HIV prevention intervention development and adaptation. The proposed mentorship and training program will focus on the following key areas: mixed methods research; adaptation science; and intervention implementation. The proposed study will occur in three phases implemented over the course of five years. The formative phase will consist of survey administration on HIV literacy, needs and barriers to practicing protective behaviors, and HIV testing from 120 recently released Black drug offenders. Also during this phase, in-depth interviews with a subsample of 24 participants (12 male and 12 female participants) will also be conducted to gather more comprehensive information exploring needs and barriers to practicing HIV protective behaviors. The intervention development and adaptation phase, will consist of analyzing data from the survey research and in-depth interviews to tailor it for use with recently released Black drug offenders. In phase 3, the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted intervention will be pilot tested using a randomized clinical trial with 64 participants who are randomized to the adapted intervention or an Enhanced Referral Intervention arm. Building on the Information-Motivation and Behavioral Skills Model, this study will address the following specific aims: 1) To examine individual-level, environmental and contextual factors that affect HIV risk-related behaviors (i.e. illicit drug use and risky sexual behavior) among formerly incarcerated Black male and female drug offenders; 2) To adapt Project START, an HIV risk reduction intervention for formerly incarcerated men, using data gathered from Aim 1, to increase access to HIV testing and address drivers of HIV vulnerability among recently released Black male and female drug offenders; and 3) To pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted Project START using a randomized clinical trial with 64 participants (32 men, 32 women). The proposed study will utilize a mixed-methods approach to investigate drivers of HIV risk among recently released Black drug offenders. By providing more contextual information on risk behaviors, future evidence-based approaches can be developed and rapidly deployed, advancing HIV prevention science, and providing essential support for a vulnerable population that consistently experiences barriers in accessing HIV prevention services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K01 application seeks to inform and adapt an HIV risk reduction intervention to address the needs of formerly incarcerated Black drug offenders who are being released from prisons in the New York City metropolitan area. The proposed mentorship and training program will focus on the following key areas: mixed methods research; adaptation science; and intervention implementation.

"Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  The Western States (WS) Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) promotes evidence-based drug abuse prevention and treatment services through continued participation in the CTN. The Node 1) designs and implements clinical trials of evidence-based treatments of addiction through rapid recruitment of diverse study participants in partnership with NIDA and the CTN, 2) generates peer-reviewed publications in collaboration with treatment providers and other nodes, and 3) uses the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Regional Research and Training Center includes talented faculty and staff from Oregon Health & Science Center and University of California, San Francisco as well as leaders of affiliated healthcare partners providing integrated primary care and substance use disorder treatment. The Node was created in 2010 as an amalgam of two CTN Nodes--California-Arizona and Oregon/Hawaii (a charter member of the CTN). The Node was highly successful, during the current award, participating in 10 CTN trials, co-leading two of these and leading one; reporting results of CTN main studies, ancillary, and research using the CTN platform in 100+ publications, and actively disseminating evidence- based practices in 200 presentations. Node investigators also sought and received awards for 10 studies that used the CTN as a platform for research. Eight WS Node healthcare programs recruited over 1,300 participants into CTN studies. In the coming grant period the Node expands to include three national and regional primary care and HIV primary care research networks: OCHIN, the HIV Research Network, and the Oregon Rural Practice-Based Research Network (ORPRN). The Node retains core addiction treatment centers experienced in CTN protocols and exploits their links with primary care: Adapt (Roseburg, OR), CODA (Portland, OR) HealthRIGHT 360 (San Francisco, CA), La Frontera (Tucson, AZ), NARA (Portland, OR), and Signal Behavioral Health Network (Denver, CO). The Node's research agenda proposes study concepts that evaluate three strategies to integrate and enhance addiction treatment within healthcare settings. Study 1 builds a patient registry for HCV infection and tests a multi-contact brief intervention for alcohol use. Study 2 extends the registry testing a candidate therapeutic HIV vaccine. Study 3, a test of reverse integration (primary care clinicians in addiction treatment settings), assesses naloxone distribution and education to reduce fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses and measures impact on return to use. Finally the WS Node continues to use the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Node has the potential to accelerate the advancement of integrated primary care and addiction in the coming years. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This renewal application to conduct research in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network has broad public health implications focused on developing and testing ways to better treat medical problems and addiction through integrated care. The project will conduct clinical trials of treatments for drug use disorders in the context of primary care addressing hepatitis C, HIV, and opioid overdose--topics of urgent national importance.

"Mentoring researchers on drug abuse and HIV DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug users with and at-risk for HIV continue to have poor access to health care and poor treatment outcomes. In addition, opioid addiction involving prescription opioids has skyrocketed. In this proposal for a mid-career investigator award, Dr. Chinazo Cunningham proposes to address the opioid epidemic and its intersection with HIV infection by: 1) becoming an internationally recognized leader in the field of drug abuse and HIV, expanding her research to include advanced research methods (comparative effectiveness research [CER] methods and complex clinical trials methods); 2) developing a standardized and structured mentorship approach to mentor junior investigators to conduct patient-oriented research related to drug abuse and/or HIV infection; and 3) becoming an effective leader in academic medicine, ensuring that the institutional infrastructure facilitates junior investigators obtaining skills necessary to become independent investigators. To achieve these goals, Dr. Cunningham will participate in courses and national conferences, have directed readings, and regularly meet with national leaders in related fields. Dr. Cunningham will particularly focus on mentoring women and racial/ethnic minorities-two groups who are under-represented in senior positions in academic medicine and NIH-funded research. Dr. Cunningham will utilize her existing research program as a foundation for which she will provide mentoring and expand her research skills to include CER and complex clinical trials methods. The aims of her research are to: 1) test the efficacy of a 16-week abstinence-reinforcing contingency management intervention on HIV viral load suppression among opioid-dependent HIV-infected individuals, using a randomized controlled trial design; and 2) examine mechanisms of achieving viral load suppression with the abstinence-reinforcing contingency management intervention. Dr. Cunningham's future research will include the establishment of a comprehensive ""live"" database of all opioid users within a large urban medical center. This database will be used to examine health outcomes associated with types of opioid use and to develop and test interventions focused on opioid use. Dr. Cunningham's long-term career objective is to improve access to care and health outcomes among drug-abusing populations with or at-risk for HIV infection by developing interventions that can reduce their disparities in health care and health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application for a K24 mid-career investigator award seeks to provide support to Dr. Chinazo Cunningham to provide excellent mentorship, effective leadership, and expand her current research to include advanced research methods (comparative effectiveness research methods and complex clinical trials methods).

"Adaptation and Implementation of Project Encuentro in the U.S.-Mexico Border ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project is a research collaboration between the University of Texas at El Paso, The Alliance for Border Collaborative and Program Comparers to adapt, implement, and evaluate a multi-level, community-based, HIV prevention intervention (Project Encuentro). The intervention will target active heroin and crack users and consists of increasing access to HIV testing via a social network HIV testing component and reducing sexual and drug use risk via a peer network brief behavioral Intervention. Encuentro also consists of conducting community awareness meeting to target structural factors affecting HIV risk. The intervention was developed in an area severely affected by violence and stigma towards drug users, El Salvador, which makes it particularly suitable for adaptation to meet the needs of drug users living in the proposed intervention site, the U.S.-Mexico border. The proposed intervention site also has been severely affected by violence which has curtailed any prior attempts to reduce the risk drug users' HIV risk. Violence has worsened structural factors which affect HIV risk such as, increasing police persecution and stigma and reducing access to resources. In our proposed project, we will engage in formative research to understand the context of HIV risk of drug users in the border region post violence and adapt the intervention accordingly. Findings will allow us to tailor intervention components to meet the needs of drug users in the region. Subsequently, we propose to test intervention effectiveness and evaluate implementation barriers and facilitators. To accomplish our project aims we will use a mixed qualitative, quantitative approach. We will begin with a formative phase by conducting in-depth interviews with drug users (n = 40) living in the region to understand how the context of drug use risk changed as a result of the violence and will administer a social network survey (n = 200) to characterize the configuration of risk networks. Findings will yield the necessary information to culturally adapt the intervention to meet the needs of drug users in the region and will help us focus our recruitment efforts where the riskiest networks are located. After the intervention is adapted with the help of our community advisory board and our community coalition, we will implement the intervention and will assess the effectiveness and reach via 6 cross-sectional surveys administered to drug users (n=1,200). We will assess the process of implementation by conducting ethnographic field notes of all intervention activities including community engagement and CAB and coalition meetings. We will assess the fidelity and quality of the intervention. Lastly, we will conduct key informant interviews with key stakeholders involved in the project and interviews and observations will be coded to reflect key systems factors related to successful implementation of intervention components in two intervention sites (El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico). Findings will be highly significant as we will be conducting parallel research on the effectiveness of interventions shown to be effective in Latino drug users in two very different contexts: El Salvador and the U.S-Mexico border. Findings will elucidate implementation challenges and barriers and such information can then be used to assess the effectiveness of diverse implementation strategies in organizations working to serve the needs of Latino drug users.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Findings will be highly significant as we will be conducting parallel research on the effectiveness of interventions shown to be effective in Latino drug users in two very different contexts: El Salvador and the U.S- Mexico border.        ",Adaptation and Implementation of Project Encuentro in the U.S.-Mexico Border,9129437,U01MD010657,"['liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Drug user ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Side ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' International ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' informant ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' implementation science ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' injection drug use ', ' peer networks ', ' violent crime ', ' Affect ', ' Awareness ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Heroin ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' El Salvador ', ' Epidemic ', ' Equipment ', ' Explosion ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Injections ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Interview ', ' Mexico ', ' Mission ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Syringes ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Work ', ' Police ', ' Latino ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Social Network ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Border Crossings ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' needle exchange ', ' Syringe-Exchange Programs ', ' Needle-Exchange Programs ', ' Collaborations ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO,U01,2016,440795,0.136020208412757
"Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  The Western States (WS) Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) promotes evidence-based drug abuse prevention and treatment services through continued participation in the CTN. The Node 1) designs and implements clinical trials of evidence-based treatments of addiction through rapid recruitment of diverse study participants in partnership with NIDA and the CTN, 2) generates peer-reviewed publications in collaboration with treatment providers and other nodes, and 3) uses the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Regional Research and Training Center includes talented faculty and staff from Oregon Health & Science Center and University of California, San Francisco as well as leaders of affiliated healthcare partners providing integrated primary care and substance use disorder treatment. The Node was created in 2010 as an amalgam of two CTN Nodes--California-Arizona and Oregon/Hawaii (a charter member of the CTN). The Node was highly successful, during the current award, participating in 10 CTN trials, co-leading two of these and leading one; reporting results of CTN main studies, ancillary, and research using the CTN platform in 100+ publications, and actively disseminating evidence- based practices in 200 presentations. Node investigators also sought and received awards for 10 studies that used the CTN as a platform for research. Eight WS Node healthcare programs recruited over 1,300 participants into CTN studies. In the coming grant period the Node expands to include three national and regional primary care and HIV primary care research networks: OCHIN, the HIV Research Network, and the Oregon Rural Practice-Based Research Network (ORPRN). The Node retains core addiction treatment centers experienced in CTN protocols and exploits their links with primary care: Adapt (Roseburg, OR), CODA (Portland, OR) HealthRIGHT 360 (San Francisco, CA), La Frontera (Tucson, AZ), NARA (Portland, OR), and Signal Behavioral Health Network (Denver, CO). The Node's research agenda proposes study concepts that evaluate three strategies to integrate and enhance addiction treatment within healthcare settings. Study 1 builds a patient registry for HCV infection and tests a multi-contact brief intervention for alcohol use. Study 2 extends the registry testing a candidate therapeutic HIV vaccine. Study 3, a test of reverse integration (primary care clinicians in addiction treatment settings), assesses naloxone distribution and education to reduce fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses and measures impact on return to use. Finally the WS Node continues to use the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Node has the potential to accelerate the advancement of integrated primary care and addiction in the coming years. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This renewal application to conduct research in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network has broad public health implications focused on developing and testing ways to better treat medical problems and addiction through integrated care. The project will conduct clinical trials of treatments for drug use disorders in the context of primary care addressing hepatitis C, HIV, and opioid overdose--topics of urgent national importance.

"Brief intervention for drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV/HCV DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this study is to reduce risk behaviors and increase health and behavioral health service utilization among disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV and HCV. This project has potential to make a significant contribution to science by advancing knowledge about the health disparities, high-risk behaviors (injection drug use, sex risk), and service utilization of this high-risk, vulnerable, an understudied group of women during a time of emerging and significant public health risk in an Appalachian rural setting. This project will incorporate standardized screening (NIDA-modified ASSIST) to identify high-risk rural women drug users from jails, including injectors. Consenting women (N=350) will be asked to participate in a baseline interview, and will then be randomly assigned to one of two study groups: (1) HIV Education (HIV- Ed n=175) which includes the NIDA standard pre and post-test counseling, HIV and HCV rapid testing, and an information packet on existing community drug abuse and HIV/HCV resources; or (2) Motivational Interviewing- based HIV Risk Reduction (MI-HIV n=175) which, in addition to what is received in the HIV-Ed group, also includes an evidence-based brief intervention for high-risk women focused on an individualized plan for enhancing motivation to reduce risk behaviors and to use health and behavioral health services in the community. Specific aims include: (1) to compare the effectiveness of an evidence-based HIV risk reduction intervention (MI-HIV) to HIV Education (NIDA Standard) in reducing sex risk behaviors, injection practices, and drug use among a culturally unique sample of disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV and HCV; and (2) to examine MI-HIV Intervention engagement as a predictor of community health and behavioral health service utilization (including drug treatment and mental health) at follow-up among disadvantaged, drug- using rural women at high risk for HIV and HCV. This project is innovative because it 1) targets a high-risk and understudied group of women, 2) uses brief intervention to not only reduce risk behavior but also to enhance motivation for using community health and behavioral health resources, and 3) utilizes a real-world setting to identify high-risk women drug users. The long-term goal of this study is to increase access to health and behavioral health services in order to improve the quality of health of high-risk rural women. The overall aim of this study is to reduce risk behaviors and increase health and behavioral health service utilization among disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high risk for HIV and HCV. This project has potential to make a significant contribution to science by providing knowledge about the health, risk behaviors, and service utilization of a vulnerable and understudied group of women during a time of emerging and significant public health risk in a rural Appalachian setting. Successful completion of the aims of this project will advance the delivery of a low-cost, potentially high impact intervention with implications for a number of other real world settings (such as criminal justice venues) where other disadvantaged high-risk drug users can be identified and targeted for intervention.",Brief intervention for drug-using rural women at high-risk for HIV/HCV,9089979,R01DA033866,"['drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Resources ', ' Health Services ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Injections ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Interview ', ' Kentucky ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Public Health ', ' Random Selection ', ' Random Allocation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Walkers ', ' Woman ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Rural ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' women at high risk ', ' High Risk Woman ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Staging ', ' Drug user ', ' Opiates ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' treatment planning ', ' Participant ', ' high risk behavior ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief intervention ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Jail ', ' Consent ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' comparison group ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' service utilization ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' prescription opiate ', ' screening ', ' injection drug use ', ' HIV/HCV ', ' HIV/Hepatitis C ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' Counseling ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2016,514704,0.12069110669681299
"Vulnerability to Drug Use & HIV: Advancing Prevention for Rural African Americans The Center for Translational and Prevention Science (CTAPS) was funded in 2009 to inform the development of prevention programs for rural African American youth through investigations of gene-environment (G-E) interplay on drug use and HIV-related behavior. The proposed continuation augments CTAPS' scientific agenda to better address racial disparities in drug use and HIV-related behavior that affect rural African Americans. Emerging research suggests that exposure to chronic stress affects the functioning of inflammatory, neuroendocrine, and neurocognitive systems beginning in childhood and adolescence. The negative consequences of chronic stress affect health-related behaviors and forecast chronic diseases of aging. Emerging evidence suggests that these processes also may affect youth and young adults' development of drug misuse and HIV related behavior. The Center will sponsor a new generation of research on (a) the neuroendocrine, inflammatory, and neurocognitive pathways through which exposure to stress among rural African American youth and young adults creates vulnerabilities to drug use and HIV-related behavior, (b), the malleable risk and protective processes that affect underlying vulnerability mechanisms , and (c) the translation of findings into new and refined preventive interventions for youth in general and rural African American youth in particular. The CTAPS will pursue these scientific goals via providing infrastructure for three support cores (Inflammation/Neuroendocrine, Neurocognitive, Biostatistics) that will enrich data from data from Core projects and pilot projects and a Pilot Core. CTAPS will facilitate communication among Center-affiliated investigators, support core directors, and core project PIs; oversee administration of Center-wide budgets and operations; provide infrastructure and administrative support for three support cores and a Pilot Core. CTAPS will spur progress via a transdisciplinary work group system designed to facilitate transdisciplinary collaboration and to organize the allocation of Center resources and disseminate research findings to multiple stakeholders including researchers, policy makers, educational organizations, and the public. The proposed Center is designed to investigate how chronic stress that rural African American's experience in childhood and adolescence affects drug misuse and HIV-related behavior in young adulthood. The Center's work will contribute to the development of prevention programs that target vulnerabilities to drug use and HIV related behavior that may be developing ""under the skin"" in phsyiolobical and neurological systems.",Vulnerability to Drug Use & HIV: Advancing Prevention for Rural African Americans,9100702,P30DA027827,"['Biometry ', ' designing ', ' work group ', ' developmental ', ' pathway ', ' Infrastructure ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' drug use ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' Funding ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' young adult ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' Drug usage ', ' Investigation ', ' pilot study ', ' Neurologic ', ' Prevention program ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Exposure to ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Childhood ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Skin ', ' black American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neurological ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Resources ', ' pediatric ', ' Investigators ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' teenage ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' design ', ' working group ', ' drug use vulnerability ', ' operation ', ' Address ', ' racial disparity ', ' Chronic stress ', ' drug misuse ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' HIV ', ' Inflammation ', ' vulnerability to drug use ', ' Science ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' Research ', ' malleable risk ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Resources ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Communication ', ' Adolescence ', ' Generations ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Affect ', ' African American ', ' Health ', ' Goals ', ' Work ', ' Translations ', ' Environment ', ' Youth ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Genes ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Budgets ', ' Stress ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,P30,2016,868355,0.11723799670551475
"Epidemiology, Prevention and Treatment of HCV in Young Adult Persons who Inject Drugs in non-urban New Mexico ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic in the U.S. is concentrated in people who inject drugs (PWID). Increasing reports of HCV including outbreaks of HCV in young adult PWID in non-urban locales have prompted concerns about an expanding epidemic. Several investigations suggest that that these spikes in HCV infection are linked to sharp increases in prescription opiate use that has been trending in the U.S, and which have resulted in young adults transitioning from prescription opiates to injection use, particularly heroin. Young adult PWID in non-urban areas may be at increased risk of infection, from the combination of high viral infectivity and high prevalence of HCV in injecting groups, together with a lack of knowledge regarding infection routes and effective prevention. New Mexico is one of the states leading recorded increases in HCV in young adults, ranking 2nd in the CDC's Emerging Infections Program (EIP), Hepatitis Surveillance Demonstration Sites project, in 2011 for the number and rate of HCV cases reported. Heroin, prescription opioids, and other drugs are also accounting for this state having one of the highest overdose rates in the country. Between October 2013 and March 2014, the New Mexico Department of Health recorded 211 cases of HCV among young adults in a pilot surveillance study, demonstrating the gravity of the problem. To address the need for prevention, care and treatment services against HCV in this population, we propose epidemiological and service uptake research in two regions of New Mexico where young adult PWID have been impacted by drug use and HCV. We will initiate a prospective cohort study of young adult non-urban PWID who will be recruited and followed in two health regions of New Mexico (the South West and North East) to: (1) gather epidemiologic data on risk behaviors, drug use patterns, injection networks, prevention needs, and health service utilization; (2) to refer young adult PWID to HCV care services, as well as other prevention and treatment opportunities including harm reduction and drug treatment, and assess rates of successful linkage, including the  cascade of care; (3) to examine factors that may contribute to non-treatment, poor adherence, and failure to achieve SVR among young adult PWID with chronic HCV infection; and (4) assess reinfection events among young adult PWID who are treated for HCV and achieve SVR. Our proposal, which we refer to in this application as New Mexico H-TIPS, will also include testing and referrals for HIV and HBV co-infections as well. A collaborative group of public health and clinical specialists linked with a strong prevention and clinical service infrastructure in New Mexico will ensure successful implementation of this research. Results from this proposed research will impact a diverse young population disproportionately at risk for HCV and reduce health disparities in a region highly impacted by drug use and HCV. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposed three-year research plan seeks to assess the epidemiology of HCV infection in young adult people who inject drugs (PWID) in non-urban areas of New Mexico. The proposed New Mexico H-TIPS project will study factors that will inform effective and integrated care and prevention models for this high-risk population. We have significant expertise in working with the target population, including recruitment and retention and in identifying HCV infection, which together with a unique infrastructure for preventive and clinical services in New Mexico, including HCV and drug treatment make this proposal highly likely to succeed. This research will contribute significantly to further knowledge of  combination  HCV prevention, and how to impact population prevalence and incidence of HCV in New Mexico and elsewhere.","Epidemiology, Prevention and Treatment of HCV in Young Adult Persons who Inject Drugs in non-urban New Mexico",9102801,U18PS004568,[''],NCHHSTP,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,U18,2016,299996,0.0839915446261307
"Health disparity in pharmacogenomics: African American SNPs and drug metabolism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As pharmacogenomics moves from bench-top to bed-side, African Americans have been left out of the advances personalized medicine holds. To date, African Americans have been largely absent from the numerous pharmacogenetic studies that identify predictive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are being used clinically to improve care. As we move toward more comprehensive bioinformatics and high- throughput methods of evaluating the genome for functionally relevant SNPs that affect drug phenotypes, we are also producing a growing health disparity in the translation of these findings into the clinic for African Americans. Current genomic methods are trying to reach beyond genome-wide association in hopes of finding biological plausibility to genetic findings. This search has led to the use of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) as a tool in pharmacogenetic association studies. SNPs labeled as eQTLs have intrinsic biological plausibility since they are significantly associated with changes in gene expression. However, no liver eQTL studies have been conducted in African Americans. By using liver-specific eQTLs, we will discover SNPs that affect drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs), which will have wide-spread scientific and clinical impact; given that most drugs currently prescribed undergo some form of hepatic metabolism. Because of the increase genetic diversity found in African Americans, they may carry population specific SNPs can never be found by pharmacogenomics studies in populations of European-descent alone. Without African American focused pharmacogenomics studies we risk excluding African Americans from personalized medicine. We plan to use primary hepatocytes to conduct gene expression studies both before and after drug enzyme induction to identify genes that are differentially expressed. Drug enzyme induction is driven by increased gene transcription; therefore, by focusing on the genes that are differentially expressed after induction we can pin-point the drivers (i.e. genes) that regulate drug metabolizing enzymes. We will then look at SNPs within and in close proximity to these genes to determine if any are associated with differences in gene expression (dubbed DI-eQTLs). We will then look to see if these DI-eQTLs are associated with pharmacokinetic measures in the same set of cell cultures, affectedly preforming a pharmacokinetic and a pharmacogenetic study in the same individual. We hypothesize that drug enzyme induction will provide us with DI-eQTLs that are strongly associated to drug pharmacokinetics, a clinically relevant phenotype. To validate these findings we will query publically available data to look for an enrichment of our DI-eQTLs within the most strongly associated SNPs in pharmacogenomic GWAS data. The association between genotype, gene expression and drug pharmacokinetics in African Americans has never been conducted before and will provide an invaluable resource for pharmacogenomics and clinical pharmacology, as well as clinical translation in this understudied population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed studies will help identify genetic mutations that affect drug metabolism in African Americans, an under-studied population in pharmacogenomics. The discovery of these novel mutations will lead to better dosing of drugs that require the liver for metabolism and potentially less side-effects from these medications. By studying the genetic mutations that affect drug metabolism in African Americans we can more fully incorporate this population into personalized medicine.",Health disparity in pharmacogenomics: African American SNPs and drug metabolism,9046395,R01MD009217,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Age ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Beds ', ' Biology ', ' cell culture ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Enzyme Induction ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' In Vitro ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Mutation ', ' Pharmacogenetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Clinical Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Adverse drug effect ', ' Drug Side Effects ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Caring ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' American ', ' QTL ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' drug metabolism ', ' drug clearance ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Genomics ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' hepatic metabolism ', ' liver metabolism ', ' Dose ', ' genomic alteration ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' Data ', ' predictive of drug response ', ' prediction of response ', ' Prediction of Response to Therapy ', ' Regulatory Pathway ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' Minority ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' predicting response ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' study population ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2016,65173,0.07890808701269215
"Family impact on drug use and HIV risk behavior in Hispanic sexual minority youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a period in which many risk behaviors tend to peak leading to adverse health outcomes, such as HIV infection. Hispanic adolescents have been shown to be at particularly high risk. Hispanic HIV incidence rates in 2010 were three times higher than non-Hispanic rates with 79% of male cases attributed to same-sex sexual contact. From 2007 to 2010, the greatest increase in Hispanic HIV rates was seen among those aged 13-24. Furthermore, drug use and unprotected sex are disproportionately high in Hispanic sexual minority youth (HSMY) (e.g., men who have sex with men, lesbian, bisexual) compared to white heterosexual youths. Limited understanding of the mechanisms driving these disparities has resulted in a lack of evidence-based interventions targeting these risk behaviors in HSMY. Family relationships have consistently shown to significantly impact these behaviors in both sexual minorities and Hispanic adolescents alike. [For example, parental awareness and support of youth's sexual identity is associated with drug use and unprotected sex.] Accordingly, the Institute of Medicine has recommended further research examine the role of family life in HSMY risk behaviors. This [mixed methods] study will use participants of [6] randomized control trials examining the relative efficacy of the Familias Unidas family-based intervention. By improving family functioning processes such as parent-child communication and parental involvement, the intervention has been efficacious in preventing and reducing drug use and unprotected sex in Hispanic adolescents. Participants reporting any sexual contact with a person of the same sex (i.e., HSMY) will be examined. [Quantitative data from five studies will be combined and analyzed using integrative data analysis (IDA) methods to account] for cohort and study-level differences across trials to minimize bias. [Participants for the qualitative study will be recruited from a currently ongoing trial.] Using past 90-day illicit drug use and past 90- day unprotected sex as primary outcomes, [quantitative analyses] will: a) test the simultaneous effects of complex social, family and individual-level factors on the primary outcomes among HSMY participants; b) assess intervention efficacy by comparing the change in primary outcomes among intervention and control groups. The qualitative study will explore HSMY experiences regarding disclosure of their sexual identities and] experiences in the intervention. [Using a mixed methods study design, results from quantitative and qualitative data will produce meta-inferences that will shed light on the role of family in HSMY sexual and drug risk behaviors to guide] the future development or adaption of preventive interventions for HSMY. The applicant will be guided by an experienced sponsorship team and engage in meaningful training activities to: increase content area HSMY health knowledge; expand skills (IDA, qualitative methods, intervention development); and promote professional growth through conference presentations and collaborative projects. The [combined research and training will ensure] the applicant a successful future as an independent researcher.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanic and sexual minority (e.g., gay, MSM, bisexual) adolescents are each recognized high-risk population subgroups, disproportionately engaging in HIV risk behaviors and drug use; however, minimal research has examined these behaviors among adolescents with both minority identities. Identifying modifiable risk and protective factors that impact these behaviors is a necessary first step to developing evidence-based preventive interventions tailored to this vulnerable population. This [mixed methods] study will sample [Hispanic sexual minority youth] (HSMY) participants from [multiple] intervention trials assessing the efficacy of Familias Unidas (a Hispanic-specific, family-centered intervention designed to reduce HIV risk behaviors and drug use among Hispanic adolescents) to: a) evaluate the impact of various aspects of a youth's social environment, focusing on the role of family on unprotected sex and drug use in HSMY; b) determine if the Familias Unidas intervention was more efficacious than control conditions in reducing unprotected sex and drug use for HSMY participants; and c) describe the unique experiences of HSMY who participated in the Familias Unidas intervention [and their experiences disclosing their sexual identity] through qualitative interviews.        ",Family impact on drug use and HIV risk behavior in Hispanic sexual minority youth,9065071,F31DA040562,"['Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ',

"The Development and Evaluation of the Ho'ouna Pono Drug Prevention Curriculum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research has indicated that Native Hawaiian youth have significantly higher rates of drug use than their non-Hawaiian counterparts (e.g., Wong, Klingle, & Price, 2004; Mayeda, Hishinuma, Nishimura, Garcia- Santiago, & Mark, 2006; Nishimura, Hishinuma, & Goebert, 2013), and that these differences are particularly pronounced in rural settings (Lai & Saka, 2005). Despite these findings, there have been very few drug prevention programs developed and evaluated specifically for these youth (Edwards, Giroux, & Okamoto, 2010; Rehuher, Hiramatsu, & Helm, 2008). Therefore, the purpose of this research proposal is to complete the development of a video-enhanced, culturally grounded, school-based drug prevention curriculum for rural Native Hawaiian youth (Ho'ouna Pono), and to evaluate the curriculum across all public middle/intermediate schools on Hawai'i Island. This will be accomplished through three specific aims. AIM 1 (Year 1) is to complete the Ho'ouna Pono drug prevention curriculum initially developed and validated in a NIDA-funded translational pilot/feasibility study (R34 DA031306). To date, five professionally filmed video vignettes depicting drug-related problem situations specific to rural Hawaiian youth and seven interactive classroom lessons have been created, implemented in randomly selected intervention schools, and preliminarily evaluated using a pre-test, post-test control group design. Aim 1 enhances and builds upon this work by producing two new video vignettes, re-editing a ""Behind the Scenes"" video, developing new classroom curricular components, and synthesizing the new content with the existing curriculum. AIM 2 (Years 2-3) is to evaluate the fully conceived curriculum across all middle/intermediate schools on Hawai'i Island (N = 15) using a dynamic wait- listed control group design (Brown, Wyman, Guo, & Peña, 2006). AIM 3 (Year 4) is to assess community, systemic, and curricular factors related to the implementation, adoption, and sustainability of the curriculum within public middle/intermediate schools on Hawaii Island. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Because Hawaiians or part-Hawaiians represent the largest Pacific Islander population in the U.S. (Harris & Jones, 2005) and have recently been shown to have significantly higher rates of drug use compared with other ethnic groups (Wu et al., 2013), research focused on drug prevention of these individuals is important to improve public health both in Hawai'i and on the Mainland U.S. This study actively engages rural communities in the full-scale development and evaluation of the Ho'ouna Pono drug prevention curriculum for Hawaiian youth, promoting the overall utility and effectiveness of the intervention. Further, the findings from this study will point to the core content of prevention interventions for Hawaiian youth in rural communities, which should be applicable to other ethnic youth populations in Hawaii and the Pacific Rim, as well as Native youth populations on the Mainland U.S.",The Development and Evaluation of the Ho'ouna Pono Drug Prevention Curriculum,9089963,R01DA037836,"['Adoption ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Hawaii ', ' Health ', ' Island ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Rural Health ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Film ', ' Rural Community ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Hawaiian ', ' Hawaiian population ', ' Outcome Study ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Indigenous ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Drug Prevention Program ', ' native youth ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' health equity ', ' ']",NIDA,HAWAII PACIFIC UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,401299,0.11304276041447972
"Prescription drug monitoring programs and opioid-related harm ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fatal overdoses related to drug use have increased nearly 600% in the past three decades, and are now the country's leading cause of injury death. This rise has been largely driven by prescription opioid (PO) overdoses, which account for more deaths than heroin, cocaine and stimulants combined. Prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), state-level databases to which pharmacy dispensers must report prescription information when certain medications are dispensed, have been advanced as tools to reduce PO-related harm. Four critical questions must be answered to determine whether PDMPs reduce PO-related harm: (1) What is the impact of PDMPs on health outcomes? While some studies suggest that PDMPs using best practices are effective in reducing ""doctor shopping"", most existing research has not examined the role of PDMPs in reducing PO-related harm, and the few that have, present inconsistent findings. (2) Do variations in PDMP characteristics affect outcomes? Existing research largely treats presence of a PDMP as a binary variable, without considering state variation in PDMP operational characteristics that have been recommended by experts as ""best practices"". (3) Who benefits the most from PDMPs? The benefit of PDMPs is likely concentrated among groups with a medical need for POs, and residents of more affluent areas. Both of these groups are more likely to access POs through their medical providers, and to receive referrals to evidence- based treatment in the case of PO-related harm. (4) Can PDMPs have unintended negative outcomes? If not implemented as part of an integrated strategy to reduce opioid-related harm, the reduction in prescriptions associated with PDMPs could potentially lead to transition to heroin use among those who abuse POs. Transitions to heroin use may be a particular concern in less affluent areas, where rates of PO-related harm are higher, and access to evidence-based treatment for PO dependence is lower. This study has two aims: (1) to test the relation between implementation of""best practice"" PDMP features and change in the rate of hospitalizations due to PO overdose (POD) and heroin overdose (HOD); and (2) to test whether the relationship between implementation of PDMP ""best practice"" characteristics and POD and HOD differed by medical need and socioeconomic characteristics of population groups. To address these aims, a typology of PDMP characteristics will be developed, including number of drug schedules reported, frequency of data reporting, proactive provision of data to authorized users, requirements for user training, registration, and data accessing, and interstate data sharing. Hospital inpatient overdose data geocoded to the zip code level will be obtained from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. We will test the impact of variations in PDMP characteristics on rates of hospitalizations due to POD and HOD across 18 U.S. states with available pre- and post-PDMP hospitalization data and heterogeneity in the year of PDMP operation, and among persons living in 13,512 zip code areas within those states across 1993-2014. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The findings from this study will inform researchers and policymakers about the types of prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) characteristics that would lead to the greatest reduction in prescription opioid (PO)-related harm, and identify potential unintended consequences of PDMP characteristics in terms of heroin- related harm and socioeconomic disparities in PO and heroin-related problems. This type of research can help policymakers decide how to better deploy scarce overdose-prevention resources: (1) invest funds in PDMP practices that produce the greatest reductions in PO-related harm; (2) modify PDMP features to decrease socioeconomic disparities in PO overdose and reduce rates of heroin-related overdose.",Prescription drug monitoring programs and opioid-related harm,9251805,R01DA039962,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Arthritis ', ' Cocaine ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Heroin ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Industry ', ' Inpatients ', ' Laws ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Length of Stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital days ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' Manuals ', ' Persons ', ' Overdose ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Population Characteristics ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Typology ', ' Work ', ' Drug Monitoring ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' Injury ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Opioid ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' tool ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Country ', ' Opiate Addiction ', ' opioid dependence ', ' opioid addiction ', ' Opiate Dependence ', ' heroin overdose ', ' diamorphine overdose ', ' cancer pain ', ' experience ', ' Harm Reduction ', ' Harm Minimization ', ' Reporting ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Population Group ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' public health relevance ', ' overdose prevention ', ' longitudinal database ', ' sharing data ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' prescription opioid abuse ', ' prescription opioid ', ' operation ', ' arthritic pain ', ' arthritis pain ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' opioid use ', ' data access ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2017,388811,0.08973357917820578
"Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for Drug Abuse and HIV (Ce-PIM) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application is for a competing renewal of the Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for HIV and Drug Abuse, a NIDA P30 Center of Excellence. The number of new HIV cases in the US remains stable at 56,000 per year and continues to disproportionately affect some groups, including young men who have sex with men (YMSM), especially from racial/ethnic minorities. The purpose of this methodology center is to develop new methodologies that can be used by federal and local agencies and communities to reduce HIV incidence. Biomedical interventions and strategies, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), rapid testing for HIV and early and consistent treatment for persons who are HIV positive (Treatment as Prevention, TasP) have been shown to have high efficacy and effectiveness in reducing HIV transmission, but there remains a giant gap between what research knows and what services needed to reduce population level incidence of HIV. The major premise of this application is that the effective biomedical to reduce HIV incidence and disparities are in hand, but success will only be achieved when they are implemented in ways that meet individual, community, and health care delivery system needs. This methods proposal addresses this major gap between research and practice through implementation science and methodology, focusing on innovative ways to address the complex, mulitilevel interactions needed to implement HIV prevention programs effectively. Two Cores, an Administrative Core and an Innovative Implementation Methods Core for HIV and Drug Abuse will carry out this work.  Aim 1 is to develop innovative methods to maximize the impact of implementation research in HIV prevention. We do this through an extended set of systems science and engineering methods that focus on improving the measurement of implementation, the modeling of implementation strategies, and the testing of implementation strategies through rigorous trials. Five qualifying grants support this work.  Aim 2 is to apply these innovative methods to close the gap between existing research, policy, and practice for HIV prevention. In addition to working closely with our five qualifying grants, we work locally with municipal Departments of Public Health and the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) HIV programs to identify and prioritize gaps in knowledge, find optimal implementation strategies for reduction of HIV transmission, and design the next large implementation trials.  Aim 3 is to disseminate methods and train/mentor leaders at the intersection of HIV prevention, implementation science, and drug abuse fields to improve implementation of HIV prevention programs. This involves mentoring the early career researchers, publishing, and providing training to networks of HIV and drug abuse researchers. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are numerous rigorously evaluated prevention programs involving biomedical interventions for preventing HIV that have demonstrated impact in efficacy and effectiveness trials. Pre-exposure prophylaxis, HIV testing, and early and consistent antiretroviral treatment have high potential for preventing HIV infections, but these are yet to be implemented sufficiently in racial/ethnic minority communities. This Ce-PIM addresses the critical methods gaps that are holding back the movement of these programs from research to practice.",Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for Drug Abuse and HIV

"Age-Varying Effects in the Epidemiology of Drug Abuse ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To improve the efficiency and efficacy of drug abuse interventions, an understanding of the age-related changes in behavior prevalences, comorbidities, and health disparities, and the evolving role of various risk factors from adolescence through middle adulthood, is crucial. Today there is an unprecedented amount of existing high-quality data that have enormous potential to shed new light on these issues. Many of these data sets are nationally representative, drawn from populations that span a wide range of ages. New methods now exist to tap those data in order to address important, new scientific questions about drug use, abuse, and dependence (drug UAD) from a developmental perspective. To this end, we propose the innovative application of the time-varying effect model (TVEM) to data from two complementary national studies of health risk behaviors: The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=20,745) and the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N=63,809). TVEM flexibly estimates behavior prevalences and associations among variables as continuous, flexible functions of age. Specifically, the specific aims for this projec are as follows. (1) To model flexible, age-varying trends in drug UAD from adolescence into middle adulthood. We will estimate rates of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and other drug use, abuse and dependence as a complex function of continuous age from ages 12 to 50. Trends will be estimated across sex and race/ethnicity to document age-varying health disparities. (2) To elucidate the age-varying role of mental health problems in the course of drug UAD from adolescence into middle adulthood. We will examine how depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation are differentially associated with drug UAD as a continuous, complex function from ages 12 to 50. (3) To estimate age-varying effects of early and concurrent risk factors on drug UAD from adolescence into middle adulthood. We will examine how and when specific risk and protective factors are associated with drug UAD from ages 12 to 50. We will consider early risk factors at the individual, parent, peer, school, and community levels, as well as concurrent factors such as marriage and parenthood. (4) To examine contributors to health disparities in drug use. To advance understanding of the developmental course of health disparities, we will examine sex and race/ethnicity as moderators of (a) age-varying comorbidities of drug UAD and mental health problems and (b) age-varying associations between risk factors and drug UAD. This project will provide knowledge about the developmental course of drug UAD and related health disparities, allowing prevention scientists and clinicians to design interventions that matc the most promising mechanisms of change to the most appropriate age period within population subgroups. To maximize the project's overall impact, we will actively disseminate this promising new analytic approach to drug abuse researchers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Existing national data have been used extensively to advance understanding of drug use, abuse, and dependence; comorbidities with mental health problems; the role of early and concurrent risk factors; and health disparities. However, empirical studies and behavioral theory have been largely silent on how these issues evolve continuously across age. This project will apply a new data analytic approach to existing cross- sectional and panel data to gain new insight into nuanced, age-related changes from adolescence through mid-adulthood, shedding light on ways to tailor interventions to individuals to increase intervention efficiency and efficacy to reduce drug abuse and its related consequences.",Age-Varying Effects in the Epidemiology of Drug Abuse,9276648,R01DA039854,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Employment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Marital Status ', ' Marriage ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Paper ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' pharmacoepidemiological ', ' pharmacoepidemiologic ', ' drug epidemiology ', ' Pharmaceutical Epidemiology ', ' Pharmacoepidemiology ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Data Quality ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' drug efficacy ', ' Intercept ', ' peer ', ' Prevention ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' trend ', ' teenage ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' attributable death ', ' attributable mortality ', ' cost ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Developmental Course ', ' adolescent health ', ' National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health ', ' National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health ', ' Add Health ', ' ']",NIDA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2017,226050,0.21078522912097405
"Contextualizing & responding to HIV risk behaviors among Black drug offenders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Formerly incarcerated Black drug offenders are at an elevated risk for HIV infection. Despite substantial research expressing the need for HIV prevention services for ex-offenders post-release, this population has limited access to quality programming and services related to HIV risk reduction. This K01 application seeks to inform and adapt an HIV risk reduction intervention to address the needs of formerly incarcerated Black drug offenders who are being released from prisons in the New York City metropolitan area. This application supports the Principal Investigator's interest in becoming an independent behavioral scientist specializing in HIV prevention intervention development and adaptation. The proposed mentorship and training program will focus on the following key areas: mixed methods research; adaptation science; and intervention implementation. The proposed study will occur in three phases implemented over the course of five years. The formative phase will consist of survey administration on HIV literacy, needs and barriers to practicing protective behaviors, and HIV testing from 120 recently released Black drug offenders. Also during this phase, in-depth interviews with a subsample of 24 participants (12 male and 12 female participants) will also be conducted to gather more comprehensive information exploring needs and barriers to practicing HIV protective behaviors. The intervention development and adaptation phase, will consist of analyzing data from the survey research and in-depth interviews to tailor it for use with recently released Black drug offenders. In phase 3, the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted intervention will be pilot tested using a randomized clinical trial with 64 participants who are randomized to the adapted intervention or an Enhanced Referral Intervention arm. Building on the Information-Motivation and Behavioral Skills Model, this study will address the following specific aims: 1) To examine individual-level, environmental and contextual factors that affect HIV risk-related behaviors (i.e. illicit drug use and risky sexual behavior) among formerly incarcerated Black male and female drug offenders; 2) To adapt Project START, an HIV risk reduction intervention for formerly incarcerated men, using data gathered from Aim 1, to increase access to HIV testing and address drivers of HIV vulnerability among recently released Black male and female drug offenders; and 3) To pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted Project START using a randomized clinical trial with 64 participants (32 men, 32 women). The proposed study will utilize a mixed-methods approach to investigate drivers of HIV risk among recently released Black drug offenders. By providing more contextual information on risk behaviors, future evidence-based approaches can be developed and rapidly deployed, advancing HIV prevention science, and providing essential support for a vulnerable population that consistently experiences barriers in accessing HIV prevention services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This K01 application seeks to inform and adapt an HIV risk reduction intervention to address the needs of formerly incarcerated Black drug offenders who are being released from prisons in the New York City metropolitan area. The proposed mentorship and training program will focus on the following key areas: mixed methods research; adaptation science; and intervention implementation.

"Cohort Studies on HIV/AIDS and Substance Abuse in Miami ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Liver disease is a major cause of death in HIV infected persons in the United States. While advances in antiretroviral therapy have significantly reduced HIV-related mortality, co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), is widespread and accelerates progression of liver fibrosis to cirrhosis and liver carcinoma. In addition, substance abuse accelerates HIV disease, and may facilitate progression of liver fibrosis. The primary goal of this proposal is to continue to follow the existing Miami Adult Studies on HIV (MASH) cohort, its specimen repository and database, and expand it from the current 881 to 1,500 study participants. The purpose is to generate collaborative studies to investigate the impact of cocaine, by far the most prevalent drug of abuse in South Florida, on HIV infection, HIV/HCV co-infection, and on long-term morbidity with a focus on liver disease in this population with disparities in access to care. HIV and HCV un-infected cocaine users and non-users will also be recruited to allow determination of the impact of cocaine use alone, as well as the interaction of cocaine use with HIV, HCV, and HIV/HCV co-infection. As new and more effective treatments and access to care for HIV, HCV and drug abuse become available, maintaining a well- characterized cohort, specimen repository and database will create a strong resource platform for current and future collaborative research. Observing the uptake of new HCV treatments and potential new cocaine cessation programs in this at-risk population with health disparities will provide data on barriers and facilitators to effective treatments to prevent long-term morbidity and mortality. We have followed the MASH cohort of 881 participants for up to 12 years with excellent retention rates, and have created a specimen repository and a database. The MASH cohort in Miami is unique because it will be a mostly Hispanic cohort with a large number of African Americans, women, non-injector drug users, with predominantly heterosexual HIV- transmission etiology. We propose to (1) compare the progression of liver fibrosis over four years among cocaine users and non-users in HIV+/HCV-, HIV+/HCV+, HIV-/HCV+, and HIV-/HCV-, using a novel non- invasive diagnostic device, the Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE). We also propose to (2) compare the pattern over four years of biomarkers and identify genetic markers associated with the mechanisms of liver fibrosis among cocaine users and non-users. Understanding the role of cocaine use in the context of HIV and HIV/HCV co-infections and lack of lasting effects of treatments for cocaine use cessation are crucial in order to gain insights into the pathogenesis and disease outcomes, and to provide the basis for identifying antifibrotic therapies such as oxidative stress, which are amenable to intervention.

"Mentoring researchers on drug abuse and HIV DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug users with and at-risk for HIV continue to have poor access to health care and poor treatment outcomes. In addition, opioid addiction involving prescription opioids has skyrocketed. In this proposal for a mid-career investigator award, Dr. Chinazo Cunningham proposes to address the opioid epidemic and its intersection with HIV infection by: 1) becoming an internationally recognized leader in the field of drug abuse and HIV, expanding her research to include advanced research methods (comparative effectiveness research [CER] methods and complex clinical trials methods); 2) developing a standardized and structured mentorship approach to mentor junior investigators to conduct patient-oriented research related to drug abuse and/or HIV infection; and 3) becoming an effective leader in academic medicine, ensuring that the institutional infrastructure facilitates junior investigators obtaining skills necessary to become independent investigators. To achieve these goals, Dr. Cunningham will participate in courses and national conferences, have directed readings, and regularly meet with national leaders in related fields. Dr. Cunningham will particularly focus on mentoring women and racial/ethnic minorities-two groups who are under-represented in senior positions in academic medicine and NIH-funded research. Dr. Cunningham will utilize her existing research program as a foundation for which she will provide mentoring and expand her research skills to include CER and complex clinical trials methods. The aims of her research are to: 1) test the efficacy of a 16-week abstinence-reinforcing contingency management intervention on HIV viral load suppression among opioid-dependent HIV-infected individuals, using a randomized controlled trial design; and 2) examine mechanisms of achieving viral load suppression with the abstinence-reinforcing contingency management intervention. Dr. Cunningham's future research will include the establishment of a comprehensive ""live"" database of all opioid users within a large urban medical center. This database will be used to examine health outcomes associated with types of opioid use and to develop and test interventions focused on opioid use. Dr. Cunningham's long-term career objective is to improve access to care and health outcomes among drug-abusing populations with or at-risk for HIV infection by developing interventions that can reduce their disparities in health care and health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application for a K24 mid-career investigator award seeks to provide support to Dr. Chinazo Cunningham to provide excellent mentorship, effective leadership, and expand her current research to include advanced research methods (comparative effectiveness research methods and complex clinical trials methods).

"Racial and ethnic disparities in alcohol and other drug use disorder recovery (F.220) 7. Project Summary Racial/ethnic health disparities have been well-documented in the onset, rate, course, and consequences of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use problems, often with substantially poorer outcomes in non-White racial/ethnic groups compared to non-Hispanic Whites. As a result, the NIAAA has made it a central strategic aim to investigate and eliminate health disparities. Despite 30 years of research documenting the presence of AOD-related racial/ethnic health disparities, the degree to which disparities negatively impact the emerging standard of assessing the effectiveness of AOD treatments (i.e., ≥ 5 years AOD problem resolution),53 which is also when risk of problematic use is no higher than in the general population,84 is unknown. Publicly available datasets are very limited by their ability to directly measure AOD recovery-related constructs and national prevalence rates of non-White racial/ethnic groups who have achieved long-term problem resolution. In turn, this compromises our ability to assess the extent to which racial/ethnic health equality exists in terms of long- term AOD problem resolution and the recovery-related mechanisms associated with potential disparities. To begin to fill this knowledge gap, we propose to conduct secondary data analyses of the first recovery-focused nationally representative probability-based study to test if racial/ethnic health disparities exist. The National Recovery Study (PI: Kelly) consists of a web-based probability sampling frame of 39,809 adults who were screened to identify if they once had a problem with drugs or alcohol and no longer do. Complete data on 2,002 participants who answered “yes” is available. Participants were assessed with a battery of quantitative and qualitative survey items in 2016 which captured their AOD clinical history and recovery-related mechanisms associated racial/ethnic health equality in AOD problem resolution. This design will enable us to address the following aims: 1a. Test if racial/ethnic health disparities exist in (i) the duration between onset of alcohol and other drug problems and onset of problem resolution; and, (ii) the likelihood of achieving long-term problem resolution (≥ 5 years) 1b. If health disparities are observed, explore the mediating potential of psychosocial (accrued recovery capital, degree of treatment utilization, degree of recovery support-service utilization) and structural recovery-related factors (health insurance coverage, socioeconomic status, and recovery-related discrimination) in explaining observed disparities. 2. Conduct concurrent qualitative analysis to identify the top three strategies that participants report having used to resolve their alcohol or other drug problem (e.g., social support, secure accommodations, mental and physical health, financial management, employment, and recreation) and compare these strategies according to racial/ethnic characteristics. Mix the qualitative and quantitative data to determine if race/ethnicity is associated with themes identified in the recovery strategies. (F.220) 8. Project Narrative Despite 30 years of research documenting the disproportionate burden that alcohol and other drug (AOD)- related problems have on non-White racial/ethnic groups, the degree to which racial/ethnic health disparities negatively impact emerging standards for assessing the effectiveness of AOD treatments (≥ 5 years AOD problem resolution), which is when the risk of problematic use is no higher than in the general population, is unknown. This F32 postdoctoral training will aid the applicant in documenting US prevalence estimates of the number of non-White individuals who have resolved an AOD problem using data from the first nationally representative, probability-based, study of recovery. Specifically, the candidate will investigate the associations between race/ethnicity and stages of AOD problem resolution in the: 1. duration between onset of AOD problems and onset of problem resolution; and, 2. the likelihood of achieving stable long-term problem resolution. In doing so, we will establish the first line of nationally representative research on health equality in long-term AOD problem resolution and associated recovery-related mechanisms, ultimately translating findings into actionable targets for clinicians, policy, and public health proposals that can address the identified disparities.",Racial and ethnic disparities in alcohol and other drug use disorder recovery,9469824,F32AA025823,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Capital ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Financial Management ', ' Occupational activity of managing finances ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Probability ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recreation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' Outcome ', ' alcohol related problem ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' NIAAA ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' service utilization ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' alcohol consequences ', ' Secure ', ' screening ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' ']",NIAAA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,F32,2017,63690,0.037463982941195906
"Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  The Western States (WS) Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) promotes evidence-based drug abuse prevention and treatment services through continued participation in the CTN. The Node 1) designs and implements clinical trials of evidence-based treatments of addiction through rapid recruitment of diverse study participants in partnership with NIDA and the CTN, 2) generates peer-reviewed publications in collaboration with treatment providers and other nodes, and 3) uses the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Regional Research and Training Center includes talented faculty and staff from Oregon Health & Science Center and University of California, San Francisco as well as leaders of affiliated healthcare partners providing integrated primary care and substance use disorder treatment. The Node was created in 2010 as an amalgam of two CTN Nodes--California-Arizona and Oregon/Hawaii (a charter member of the CTN). The Node was highly successful, during the current award, participating in 10 CTN trials, co-leading two of these and leading one; reporting results of CTN main studies, ancillary, and research using the CTN platform in 100+ publications, and actively disseminating evidence- based practices in 200 presentations. Node investigators also sought and received awards for 10 studies that used the CTN as a platform for research. Eight WS Node healthcare programs recruited over 1,300 participants into CTN studies. In the coming grant period the Node expands to include three national and regional primary care and HIV primary care research networks: OCHIN, the HIV Research Network, and the Oregon Rural Practice-Based Research Network (ORPRN). The Node retains core addiction treatment centers experienced in CTN protocols and exploits their links with primary care: Adapt (Roseburg, OR), CODA (Portland, OR) HealthRIGHT 360 (San Francisco, CA), La Frontera (Tucson, AZ), NARA (Portland, OR), and Signal Behavioral Health Network (Denver, CO). The Node's research agenda proposes study concepts that evaluate three strategies to integrate and enhance addiction treatment within healthcare settings. Study 1 builds a patient registry for HCV infection and tests a multi-contact brief intervention for alcohol use. Study 2 extends the registry testing a candidate therapeutic HIV vaccine. Study 3, a test of reverse integration (primary care clinicians in addiction treatment settings), assesses naloxone distribution and education to reduce fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses and measures impact on return to use. Finally the WS Node continues to use the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Node has the potential to accelerate the advancement of integrated primary care and addiction in the coming years. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This renewal application to conduct research in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network has broad public health implications focused on developing and testing ways to better treat medical problems and addiction through integrated care. The project will conduct clinical trials of treatments for drug use disorders in the context of primary care addressing hepatitis C, HIV, and opioid overdose--topics of urgent national importance.

"Social Networks and HIV Risk Behaviors of Special Populations of Drug Users DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this resubmitted K02 application is to further develop Dr. Carrie Oser's productive independent research career and to augment her research focus on HIV, substance abuse treatment, crime, and health disparities by gaining new training on social networks and HIV intervention development. The K02 builds upon her focus on special populations, including both rural drug users and African American drug users. The proposed training goals will provide new instruction in social networks, HIV intervention development, and the responsible conduct of research. The specific aims are: (1) to identify HIV and HCV risk and longitudinal changes in risk in the social networks of 503 rural out-of-treatment drug using women, as compared to men; and (2) to examine the effect of social networks, including structure (e.g., size, density), function (e.g., emotional and instrument support), and content (e.g., attitudes towards physicians), on HIV and HCV risk behaviors and health services utilization among African American drug using women, as compared to men, across criminal justice status. This significant and innovative study will have strong public healt impacts and will support NIDA's Health Disparities Initiative because of its potential to contribut to our understanding of the cultural and social network correlates of health disparities among both rural and African American drug users. In addition, this study improves upon the methodological limitations of previous research findings by examining various social networks (e.g., egocentric, dyadic, and sociocentric) and using longitudinal data in multilevel models. This proposed project will allow for a practical application of the substantive knowledge and analytical skills acquired from the K02 training activities and will ultimately culminate in the development of forthcoming investigator initiated NIDA grant applications. Specifically, these findings will be used as a foundation for future HIV social networks based intervention to increase special populations' use of preventative health care and subsequently reduce the need for expensive medical services, as well as to decrease HIV risk behaviors including drug use, unprotected sex, and recidivism. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is significant to the public health field because of its potential to understand the individual, cultural, and social network factors associated with HI and HCV risk behaviors among two special populations - rural drug users and African American drug users.

"Health Consequences of Drug Use and IPV Trajectories for Young Latinas ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Few empirical studies have documented the life trajectories of gang-affiliated adolescent females and the long- term health consequences of adolescent drug use and partner violence victimization. The purpose of this study is to identify and determine how distinct drug use and intimate partner violence victimization trajectories that emerge in adolescence through young adulthood contribute to physical and mental health outcomes among Mexican American women within the context of a highly disadvantaged community. This group of women are particularly vulnerable given they have low rates of access and utilization of health care, are the most likely age group to be uninsured, and represent a nexus of risk, vulnerability and potentially high costs to communities given their reproductive and sexual health stage of life. This application proposes a 15 year follow up of a cohort of Mexican American adolescent females previously identified in a CDC funded study who were affiliated with male gang members during their adolescence and involved in high rates of drug use and victims of intimate partner violence. Building upon the research teams previous studies and using analytical tools from the theory of gender and power and social bonding theory, this application will implement a concurrent mixed methods nested design approach to provide a comprehensive understanding of the long-term consequences of drug use and IPV. The sample will consist of 300 young adult Mexican-American females. The specific aims for this study are: 1) determine the prevalence of physical (cardiovascular and metabolic risk markers and STI infection) and mental (depression, PTSD, anxiety/stress) health outcomes; 2) identify and characterize distinct drug use and IPV trajectories from adolescence through young adulthood; 3) determine whether sexual relationship power and family social bonds during distinct age-graded stages alter drug use and IPV trajectories and health outcomes; and 4) characterize qualitatively the culture and community context and their influence on drug use and IPV trajectories over the life course. This research will have an important positive impact by identifying women who are at the highest risk for developing harmful drug and IPV trajectories as they transition into young adulthood. In doing this, we will lay the foundation for identifying critical points of behavioral intervention during key age-graded periods as well as culturally and contextually appropriate values and strategies that will reduce health disparities among similar high-risk female populations that have gone underrepresented in existing research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This application seek a comprehensive understanding of the long term health consequences of drug use and intimate partner violence victimization physical and mental health outcomes among a vulnerable cohort of Mexican-American females recruited over 15 years ago who were affiliated with male gang members during their adolescence. The study will provide a unique opportunity to investigate detrimental life trajectories contributing t the prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic risk markers, infection, depression, PTSD, anxiety and stress within a marginalized and underserved community context.

"Adaptation and Implementation of Project Encuentro in the U.S.-Mexico Border ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project is a research collaboration between the University of Texas at El Paso, The Alliance for Border Collaborative and Program Comparers to adapt, implement, and evaluate a multi-level, community-based, HIV prevention intervention (Project Encuentro). The intervention will target active heroin and crack users and consists of increasing access to HIV testing via a social network HIV testing component and reducing sexual and drug use risk via a peer network brief behavioral Intervention. Encuentro also consists of conducting community awareness meeting to target structural factors affecting HIV risk. The intervention was developed in an area severely affected by violence and stigma towards drug users, El Salvador, which makes it particularly suitable for adaptation to meet the needs of drug users living in the proposed intervention site, the U.S.-Mexico border. The proposed intervention site also has been severely affected by violence which has curtailed any prior attempts to reduce the risk drug users' HIV risk. Violence has worsened structural factors which affect HIV risk such as, increasing police persecution and stigma and reducing access to resources. In our proposed project, we will engage in formative research to understand the context of HIV risk of drug users in the border region post violence and adapt the intervention accordingly. Findings will allow us to tailor intervention components to meet the needs of drug users in the region. Subsequently, we propose to test intervention effectiveness and evaluate implementation barriers and facilitators. To accomplish our project aims we will use a mixed qualitative, quantitative approach. We will begin with a formative phase by conducting in-depth interviews with drug users (n = 40) living in the region to understand how the context of drug use risk changed as a result of the violence and will administer a social network survey (n = 200) to characterize the configuration of risk networks. Findings will yield the necessary information to culturally adapt the intervention to meet the needs of drug users in the region and will help us focus our recruitment efforts where the riskiest networks are located. After the intervention is adapted with the help of our community advisory board and our community coalition, we will implement the intervention and will assess the effectiveness and reach via 6 cross-sectional surveys administered to drug users (n=1,200). We will assess the process of implementation by conducting ethnographic field notes of all intervention activities including community engagement and CAB and coalition meetings. We will assess the fidelity and quality of the intervention. Lastly, we will conduct key informant interviews with key stakeholders involved in the project and interviews and observations will be coded to reflect key systems factors related to successful implementation of intervention components in two intervention sites (El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico). Findings will be highly significant as we will be conducting parallel research on the effectiveness of interventions shown to be effective in Latino drug users in two very different contexts: El Salvador and the U.S-Mexico border. Findings will elucidate implementation challenges and barriers and such information can then be used to assess the effectiveness of diverse implementation strategies in organizations working to serve the needs of Latino drug users.

"Stress and Drug Use Vulnerability in the African American Community DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The impacts that drug addictions have on health disparities that adversely affect African Americans are grossly understudied. While there is strong evidence linking drug abuse to poor health and problem behaviors in the African American community, the progression of drug abuse is inconsistent (i.e., relatively late initiation and heavy use in the 30s) with national norms and remains unclear. Exposure to chronic stress and the subsequent activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been connected to drug addictions and poor health outcomes. This association is of particular importance since residents in these communities are exposed to many of the risk factors associated with the onset of drug abuse: familial risk, deprived social environment, unemployment, substandard education, low-to-no socioeconomic status, and enduring exposure to experiences of racism and discrimination. Repeated exposure to environmental stressors will lead to 'wear-and-tear' on the body's regulatory system and have profound implications on HPA functioning and the subsequent risk of developing an addiction. This study will pursue three primary aims: (1) Investigate HPA reactivity to acute stress as a predictor of current drug use severity. (2) Investigate trajectories of HPA regulation (level and circadian rhythm) as a predicto of drug use vulnerability across time. (3) Investigate delay discounting as a moderator between trajectories of HPA regulation and drug use vulnerability across time. This study will enroll 350 African American adults (ages 18-21) who reside in the southeastern U.S. and utilize a prospective longitudinal research design that consists of a laboratory assessment involving the Trier Social Stress Test, three in-home assessments that include clinical interviews and behavioral tasks, and six internet assessments that track drug use and related risk factors across a 2-year period. Primary independent variables include environmental stressors, stress-related biomarkers (i.e., salivary cortical, salivary DHEA, heart rate variability, and galvanic skn resistance), and delay discounting. Primary dependent variables include drug use, severity of drug use disorders, and drug use consequences. This study is highly innovative for three primary reasons: (1) A longitudinal research design will be used for the first time to investigate trajectories of HPA regulation as a predictor of drug use vulnerability; (2) The use of multiple indicators of the stress regulatory system, clinical interviews, and a novel behavioral task provides a more nuanced understanding of the research aims; and (3) This study focuses on an understudied population that suffers from drug-related health disparities, but are rarely included in cutting edge laboratory research. It is envisioned that this approach will uncover latent-curve trajectories of stress deregulation as a predictor of drug use vulnerability in this population. Findings from this study will identify causal mechanisms of drug addictions that will advance theory, research, prevention, and treatments aimed at addressing this growing public health problem. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of drug abuse in the African American community is often characterized by oversimplified models that are rooted in research studies that rarely include African Americans. This study will identify mechanisms that influence drug use vulnerability in at-risk African American adults who reside in the southeastern U.S. Such research is needed to develop socially and culturally informed prevention and treatment programs aimed at reducing drug-related health disparities that continue to plague African Americans.",Stress and Drug Use Vulnerability in the African American Community,9197280,R01DA034739,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' suprarenal gland ', ' Adrenals ', ' Adrenal Glands ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Belief ', ' diurnal variation ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' circadian ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Diurnal Rhythm ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Therapeutic Dehydroepiandrosterone ', ' Prasterone ', ' Dehydroisoandrosterone ', ' DHEA ', ' Androstenolone ', ' dehydroepiandrosterone ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Pituitary Gland ', ' Pituitary Nervous System ', ' Pituitary ', ' Hypophysis Cerebri ', ' Hypophysis ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Psychotropic Drugs ', ' Psychopharmaceuticals ', ' Psychoactive Drugs ', ' Psychoactive Compound ', ' Psychoactive Agents ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Stimulus ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Spirituality ', ' Recovery ', ' Rural ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Exposure to ', ' Severities ', ' Salivary ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' System ', ' environmental stressor ', ' experience ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' treatment program ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Impulsivity ', ' acute stress ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' drug development ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' discount ', ' Behavioral ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' discounting ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Trier Social Stress Test ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' disability burden ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' public health relevance ', ' multimodality ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' heart rate variability ', ' constriction ', ' longitudinal design ', ' injury burden ', ' behavioral economics ', ' drug use vulnerability ', ' vulnerability to drug use ', ' illicit drug use ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2017,389887,0.21249262221003148
"Health disparity in pharmacogenomics: African American SNPs and drug metabolism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As pharmacogenomics moves from bench-top to bed-side, African Americans have been left out of the advances personalized medicine holds. To date, African Americans have been largely absent from the numerous pharmacogenetic studies that identify predictive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are being used clinically to improve care. As we move toward more comprehensive bioinformatics and high- throughput methods of evaluating the genome for functionally relevant SNPs that affect drug phenotypes, we are also producing a growing health disparity in the translation of these findings into the clinic for African Americans. Current genomic methods are trying to reach beyond genome-wide association in hopes of finding biological plausibility to genetic findings. This search has led to the use of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) as a tool in pharmacogenetic association studies. SNPs labeled as eQTLs have intrinsic biological plausibility since they are significantly associated with changes in gene expression. However, no liver eQTL studies have been conducted in African Americans. By using liver-specific eQTLs, we will discover SNPs that affect drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs), which will have wide-spread scientific and clinical impact; given that most drugs currently prescribed undergo some form of hepatic metabolism. Because of the increase genetic diversity found in African Americans, they may carry population specific SNPs can never be found by pharmacogenomics studies in populations of European-descent alone. Without African American focused pharmacogenomics studies we risk excluding African Americans from personalized medicine. We plan to use primary hepatocytes to conduct gene expression studies both before and after drug enzyme induction to identify genes that are differentially expressed. Drug enzyme induction is driven by increased gene transcription; therefore, by focusing on the genes that are differentially expressed after induction we can pin-point the drivers (i.e. genes) that regulate drug metabolizing enzymes. We will then look at SNPs within and in close proximity to these genes to determine if any are associated with differences in gene expression (dubbed DI-eQTLs). We will then look to see if these DI-eQTLs are associated with pharmacokinetic measures in the same set of cell cultures, affectedly preforming a pharmacokinetic and a pharmacogenetic study in the same individual. We hypothesize that drug enzyme induction will provide us with DI-eQTLs that are strongly associated to drug pharmacokinetics, a clinically relevant phenotype. To validate these findings we will query publically available data to look for an enrichment of our DI-eQTLs within the most strongly associated SNPs in pharmacogenomic GWAS data. The association between genotype, gene expression and drug pharmacokinetics in African Americans has never been conducted before and will provide an invaluable resource for pharmacogenomics and clinical pharmacology, as well as clinical translation in this understudied population.

"Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for Drug Abuse and HIV (Ce-PIM) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application is for a competing renewal of the Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for HIV and Drug Abuse, a NIDA P30 Center of Excellence. The number of new HIV cases in the US remains stable at 56,000 per year and continues to disproportionately affect some groups, including young men who have sex with men (YMSM), especially from racial/ethnic minorities. The purpose of this methodology center is to develop new methodologies that can be used by federal and local agencies and communities to reduce HIV incidence. Biomedical interventions and strategies, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), rapid testing for HIV and early and consistent treatment for persons who are HIV positive (Treatment as Prevention, TasP) have been shown to have high efficacy and effectiveness in reducing HIV transmission, but there remains a giant gap between what research knows and what services needed to reduce population level incidence of HIV. The major premise of this application is that the effective biomedical to reduce HIV incidence and disparities are in hand, but success will only be achieved when they are implemented in ways that meet individual, community, and health care delivery system needs. This methods proposal addresses this major gap between research and practice through implementation science and methodology, focusing on innovative ways to address the complex, mulitilevel interactions needed to implement HIV prevention programs effectively. Two Cores, an Administrative Core and an Innovative Implementation Methods Core for HIV and Drug Abuse will carry out this work.  Aim 1 is to develop innovative methods to maximize the impact of implementation research in HIV prevention. We do this through an extended set of systems science and engineering methods that focus on improving the measurement of implementation, the modeling of implementation strategies, and the testing of implementation strategies through rigorous trials. Five qualifying grants support this work.  Aim 2 is to apply these innovative methods to close the gap between existing research, policy, and practice for HIV prevention. In addition to working closely with our five qualifying grants, we work locally with municipal Departments of Public Health and the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) HIV programs to identify and prioritize gaps in knowledge, find optimal implementation strategies for reduction of HIV transmission, and design the next large implementation trials.  Aim 3 is to disseminate methods and train/mentor leaders at the intersection of HIV prevention, implementation science, and drug abuse fields to improve implementation of HIV prevention programs. This involves mentoring the early career researchers, publishing, and providing training to networks of HIV and drug abuse researchers. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are numerous rigorously evaluated prevention programs involving biomedical interventions for preventing HIV that have demonstrated impact in efficacy and effectiveness trials. Pre-exposure prophylaxis, HIV testing, and early and consistent antiretroviral treatment have high potential for preventing HIV infections, but these are yet to be implemented sufficiently in racial/ethnic minority communities. This Ce-PIM addresses the critical methods gaps that are holding back the movement of these programs from research to practice.",Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for Drug Abuse and HIV

Further, the findings from this study will point to the core content of prevention interventions for Hawaiian youth in rural communities, which should be applicable to other ethnic youth populations in Hawaii and the Pacific Rim, as well as Native youth populations on the Mainland U.S.",The Development and Evaluation of the Ho'ouna Pono Drug Prevention Curriculum,9480129,R01DA037836,"['Adoption ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Hawaii ', ' Island ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Rural Health ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' pricing ', ' Price ', ' Film ', ' Rural Community ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Hawaiian population ', ' Hawaiian ', ' Outcome Study ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Indigenous ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Drug Prevention Program ', ' native youth ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' public health relevance ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' health equity ', ' rural setting ', ' Native Hawaiian ', ' ']",NIDA,HAWAII PACIFIC UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,6307,0.11304276041447972
"Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  The Western States (WS) Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) promotes evidence-based drug abuse prevention and treatment services through continued participation in the CTN. The Node 1) designs and implements clinical trials of evidence-based treatments of addiction through rapid recruitment of diverse study participants in partnership with NIDA and the CTN, 2) generates peer-reviewed publications in collaboration with treatment providers and other nodes, and 3) uses the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Regional Research and Training Center includes talented faculty and staff from Oregon Health & Science Center and University of California, San Francisco as well as leaders of affiliated healthcare partners providing integrated primary care and substance use disorder treatment. The Node was created in 2010 as an amalgam of two CTN Nodes--California-Arizona and Oregon/Hawaii (a charter member of the CTN). The Node was highly successful, during the current award, participating in 10 CTN trials, co-leading two of these and leading one; reporting results of CTN main studies, ancillary, and research using the CTN platform in 100+ publications, and actively disseminating evidence- based practices in 200 presentations. Node investigators also sought and received awards for 10 studies that used the CTN as a platform for research. Eight WS Node healthcare programs recruited over 1,300 participants into CTN studies. In the coming grant period the Node expands to include three national and regional primary care and HIV primary care research networks: OCHIN, the HIV Research Network, and the Oregon Rural Practice-Based Research Network (ORPRN). The Node retains core addiction treatment centers experienced in CTN protocols and exploits their links with primary care: Adapt (Roseburg, OR), CODA (Portland, OR) HealthRIGHT 360 (San Francisco, CA), La Frontera (Tucson, AZ), NARA (Portland, OR), and Signal Behavioral Health Network (Denver, CO). The Node's research agenda proposes study concepts that evaluate three strategies to integrate and enhance addiction treatment within healthcare settings. Study 1 builds a patient registry for HCV infection and tests a multi-contact brief intervention for alcohol use. Study 2 extends the registry testing a candidate therapeutic HIV vaccine. Study 3, a test of reverse integration (primary care clinicians in addiction treatment settings), assesses naloxone distribution and education to reduce fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses and measures impact on return to use. Finally the WS Node continues to use the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Node has the potential to accelerate the advancement of integrated primary care and addiction in the coming years. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This renewal application to conduct research in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network has broad public health implications focused on developing and testing ways to better treat medical problems and addiction through integrated care. The project will conduct clinical trials of treatments for drug use disorders in the context of primary care addressing hepatitis C, HIV, and opioid overdose--topics of urgent national importance. This research can accelerate the advancement of providing integrated treatments for medical problems and addiction in the coming years.",Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment

"Couples-based intervention to reduce drug use and HIV transmission Project Summary YMSM in relationships with other men face unique and compounded risk factors for both drug use and HIV infection. Their vulnerability is unique from older MSM, unpartnered MSM and their heterosexual peers. This enhanced vulnerability emerges as exactly the developmental period when the establishment of romantic relationships emerges as salient. Despite their unique vulnerability for HIV infection and challenges related to drug use, there are very few couples- based intervention options for YMSM. There are presently no brief, couples-based interventions which integrate a focus on drug use and HIV prevention. The proposed study is geared toward the development of such an intervention. The only individually delivered intervention for YMSM to show significant reductions in both drug use and sexual HIV transmission risk behavior, the Young Men’s Health Project (YMHP) was developed by members of this research team. YMHP focused on sexual risk in the context of casual partners. Beginning with this framework, our team has completed the initial stages of revising YMHP for use with couples, resulting in the creation of the Couple’s Health Project (CHP). Our formative work suggests that the prototype intervention is feasible and acceptable to participants. The next step is to develop components of the intervention which address pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake and to determine how best to integrate biological testing for STI’s and drug use into the study. The new intervention will be informed by qualitative data gathered from intervention sessions delivered in our formative work and from qualitative interviews conducted with 20 HIV negative partnered YMSM. The final 28 months of the project are devoted to a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing CHP to an attention-matched educational control condition. The study team is led by Dr. Tyrel J. Starks (PI), a new investigator with substantial experience in the study of gay male couples. He has collaborated on numerous projects examining the nature of sexual agreements and their association with substance use and HIV transmission risk behavior. He is supported by a study team which includes Dr. Jeffrey Parsons, the PI of the original YMHP study. The team brings extensive experience in quantitative and qualitative data analysis, HIV prevention research, and specifically intervention development. Project Narrative – Public Health Significance HIV prevention strategies that address the specific needs of YMSM in stable relationships with other men are needed in response to accumulating evidence which points to the unique vulnerability of these men. The proposed project builds upon an effective individual intervention, the Young Men’s Health Project, to develop a couples-based intervention which addresses drug use and sexual HIV transmission risk among partnered HIV negative YMSM (ages 18-29). Preliminary work by our research team has produced a prototype manual, and provided compelling evidence of feasibility and acceptability. The proposed project will revise this prototype manual to enhance the focus on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and to incorporate biological testing for drug use and STIs into the study. During Phase II, a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 50 couples will test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the new intervention relative to an attention-matched educational control.",Couples-based intervention to reduce drug use and HIV transmission,9346829,R34DA043422,"['Accounting ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' dl-Amphetamine ', ' Phenopromin ', ' Phenamine ', ' Desoxynorephedrin ', ' Amphetamines ', ' Attention ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Communication ', ' Counseling ', ' Couples ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Ketamine ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Motivation ', ' Nitrates ', ' NO3- ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Rosa ', ' Rose ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' free base cocaine ', ' Crack Cocaine ', ' Latino ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine ', ' N,alpha-dimethyl-1,3-benzodioxole-5-ethanamine ', ' Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ', ' MDMA ', ' 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine ', ' ecstasy ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Fingernail ', ' Finger Nail ', ' Structure of nail of finger ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Gays ', ' uptake ', ' Anal Sex ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Couples Therapy ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Nature ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' 4-hydroxybutyric acid ', ' gamma-hydroxybutyric acid ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' prevention service ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Update ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Preparation ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' male health ', "" men's health "", ' trial comparing ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' prototype ', ' standard of care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' follow up assessment ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' same-sex couple ', ' same sex relationship ', ' same sex partner ', ' sexual HIV transmission ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' efficacy study ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' ']",NIDA,HUNTER COLLEGE,R34,2017,222300,0.0832515560440776

"Vulnerability to Drug Use & HIV: Advancing Prevention for Rural African Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Center for Translational and Prevention Science (CTAPS) was funded in 2009 to inform the development of prevention programs for rural African American youth through investigations of gene environment (G-E) interplay on drug use and HIV-related behavior. The proposed continuation augments CTAPS' scientific agenda to better address racial disparities in drug use and HIV-related behavior that affect rural African Americans. Emerging research suggests that exposure to chronic stress affects the functioning of inflammatory, neuroendocrine, and neurocognitive systems beginning in childhood and adolescence. The negative consequences of chronic stress affect health-related behaviors and forecast chronic diseases of aging. Emerging evidence suggests that these processes also may affect youth and young adults' development of drug misuse and HIV related behavior. The Center will sponsor a new generation of research on (a) the neuroendocrine, inflammatory, and neurocognitive pathways through which exposure to stress among rural African American youth and young adults creates vulnerabilities to drug use and HIV related behavior, (b), the malleable risk and protective processes that affect underlying vulnerability mechanisms , and (c) the translation of findings into new and refined preventive interventions for youth in general and rural African American youth in particular. The CTAPS will pursue these scientific goals via providing infrastructure for three support cores (Inflammation/Neuroendocrine, Neurocognitive, Biostatistics) that will enrich data from data from Core projects and pilot projects and a Pilot Core. CTAPS will facilitate communication among Center-affiliated investigators, support core directors, and core project PIs; oversee administration of Center-wide budgets and operations; provide infrastructure and administrative support for three support cores and a Pilot Core. CTAPS will spur progress via a transdisciplinary work group system designed to facilitate transdisciplinary collaboration and to organize the allocation of Center resources and disseminate research findings to multiple stakeholders including researchers, policy makers, educational organizations, and the public.             The proposed Center is designed to investigate how chronic stress that rural African American's experience in childhood and adolescence affects drug misuse and HIV-related behavior in young adulthood. The Center's work will contribute to the development of prevention programs that target vulnerabilities to drug use and HIV related behavior that may be developing ""under the skin"" in phsyiolobical and neurological systems.",Vulnerability to Drug Use & HIV: Advancing Prevention for Rural African Americans,9304045,P30DA027827,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Budgets ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communication ', ' Environment ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Inflammation ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policy Maker ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' experience ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' drug development ', ' Skin ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' malleable risk ', ' operation ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' drug use vulnerability ', ' vulnerability to drug use ', ' drug misuse ', ' rural African American ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,P30,2017,965592,0.11631766570436483

"Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  The Western States (WS) Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) promotes evidence-based drug abuse prevention and treatment services through continued participation in the CTN. The Node 1) designs and implements clinical trials of evidence-based treatments of addiction through rapid recruitment of diverse study participants in partnership with NIDA and the CTN, 2) generates peer-reviewed publications in collaboration with treatment providers and other nodes, and 3) uses the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Regional Research and Training Center includes talented faculty and staff from Oregon Health & Science Center and University of California, San Francisco as well as leaders of affiliated healthcare partners providing integrated primary care and substance use disorder treatment. The Node was created in 2010 as an amalgam of two CTN Nodes--California-Arizona and Oregon/Hawaii (a charter member of the CTN). The Node was highly successful, during the current award, participating in 10 CTN trials, co-leading two of these and leading one; reporting results of CTN main studies, ancillary, and research using the CTN platform in 100+ publications, and actively disseminating evidence- based practices in 200 presentations. Node investigators also sought and received awards for 10 studies that used the CTN as a platform for research. Eight WS Node healthcare programs recruited over 1,300 participants into CTN studies. In the coming grant period the Node expands to include three national and regional primary care and HIV primary care research networks: OCHIN, the HIV Research Network, and the Oregon Rural Practice-Based Research Network (ORPRN). The Node retains core addiction treatment centers experienced in CTN protocols and exploits their links with primary care: Adapt (Roseburg, OR), CODA (Portland, OR) HealthRIGHT 360 (San Francisco, CA), La Frontera (Tucson, AZ), NARA (Portland, OR), and Signal Behavioral Health Network (Denver, CO). The Node's research agenda proposes study concepts that evaluate three strategies to integrate and enhance addiction treatment within healthcare settings. Study 1 builds a patient registry for HCV infection and tests a multi-contact brief intervention for alcohol use. Study 2 extends the registry testing a candidate therapeutic HIV vaccine. Study 3, a test of reverse integration (primary care clinicians in addiction treatment settings), assesses naloxone distribution and education to reduce fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses and measures impact on return to use. Finally the WS Node continues to use the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Node has the potential to accelerate the advancement of integrated primary care and addiction in the coming years. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This renewal application to conduct research in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network has broad public health implications focused on developing and testing ways to better treat medical problems and addiction through integrated care. The project will conduct clinical trials of treatments for drug use disorders in the context of primary care addressing hepatitis C, HIV, and opioid overdose--topics of urgent national importance.

"Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for Drug Abuse and HIV (Ce-PIM) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application is for a competing renewal of the Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for HIV and Drug Abuse, a NIDA P30 Center of Excellence. The number of new HIV cases in the US remains stable at 56,000 per year and continues to disproportionately affect some groups, including young men who have sex with men (YMSM), especially from racial/ethnic minorities. The purpose of this methodology center is to develop new methodologies that can be used by federal and local agencies and communities to reduce HIV incidence. Biomedical interventions and strategies, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), rapid testing for HIV and early and consistent treatment for persons who are HIV positive (Treatment as Prevention, TasP) have been shown to have high efficacy and effectiveness in reducing HIV transmission, but there remains a giant gap between what research knows and what services needed to reduce population level incidence of HIV. The major premise of this application is that the effective biomedical to reduce HIV incidence and disparities are in hand, but success will only be achieved when they are implemented in ways that meet individual, community, and health care delivery system needs. This methods proposal addresses this major gap between research and practice through implementation science and methodology, focusing on innovative ways to address the complex, mulitilevel interactions needed to implement HIV prevention programs effectively. Two Cores, an Administrative Core and an Innovative Implementation Methods Core for HIV and Drug Abuse will carry out this work.  Aim 1 is to develop innovative methods to maximize the impact of implementation research in HIV prevention. We do this through an extended set of systems science and engineering methods that focus on improving the measurement of implementation, the modeling of implementation strategies, and the testing of implementation strategies through rigorous trials. Five qualifying grants support this work.  Aim 2 is to apply these innovative methods to close the gap between existing research, policy, and practice for HIV prevention. In addition to working closely with our five qualifying grants, we work locally with municipal Departments of Public Health and the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) HIV programs to identify and prioritize gaps in knowledge, find optimal implementation strategies for reduction of HIV transmission, and design the next large implementation trials.  Aim 3 is to disseminate methods and train/mentor leaders at the intersection of HIV prevention, implementation science, and drug abuse fields to improve implementation of HIV prevention programs. This involves mentoring the early career researchers, publishing, and providing training to networks of HIV and drug abuse researchers. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are numerous rigorously evaluated prevention programs involving biomedical interventions for preventing HIV that have demonstrated impact in efficacy and effectiveness trials. Pre-exposure prophylaxis, HIV testing, and early and consistent antiretroviral treatment have high potential for preventing HIV infections, but these are yet to be implemented sufficiently in racial/ethnic minority communities.

"Effects of State-Level Policy Implementation on Opiate Abuse and Mortality Project Summary States have responded to the current opiate crisis through implementing several different types of policies, such as prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), expanded naloxone access, and Good Samaritan immunity. At present, the full efficacy of each of these policies is unknown beyond examinations of a limited set of policies, localities, or years. This research study will use causal statistical methods and a robust policy database to examine the impact of relevant policies on opiate use, dependence, and fatal overdose from 1999 to the present. For policy data, we will employ the new and as yet underutilized NIDA-funded Prescription Drug Abuse Policy System (PDAPS) to evaluate the effects of opiate relevant policies. We will accomplish this goal by coding this database by state and year and combining it with mortality data from the Center of Disease Control and data on use and dependence from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, as well as time- varying control measures from the U.S. Census Bureau and FBI Uniform Crime Reports. We will analyze this dataset using fixed effects and difference-in-difference models, which are causal methods for observational data well-known for the elimination of unobserved heterogeneity, such that estimators are robust to any observable or unobservable time-invariant omitted variables. The fixed effects and difference-in-difference approaches respectively provide a causal interpretation of (a) whether a given state experiences a decrease in opiate outcomes after passing a particular policy, and (b) whether a state that passes a policy experiences a decrease in opiate outcomes relative to a state that does not have that policy. The PDAPS database contains detailed policy information (e.g. to whom practitioners can prescribe naloxone, who has access to PDMPs), such that we can determine which of the nuanced approaches to these policies are most efficacious. We will examine whether each policy component affects use, dependence, and fatal overdose for opiates generally as well as separately for prescription opiates and heroin. In addition, we will test for synergistic effects of policy; that is, whether the combination of any given policies is particularly effective. Finally, we will conduct these analyses by key demographics: gender, race/ethnicity, age, and urbanicity, which will permit the identification of related health disparities. Our proposed exploratory research provides an opportunity to test the impact of a rapidly evolving policy landscape on opiate outcomes and will contribute in additional ways. First, if certain policies or combinations of policies are identified as efficacious, the results would provide evidence for broader adoption to curb the current opiate crisis. Second, the identification of possible health disparities in the benefits of policy implementation may not only help public health professionals to work towards redressing these disparities, but also identify policies that may “bypass” social inequalities to provide comprehensive benefits to citizens. Finally, this exploratory study establishes a foundation for future research that will consider local policy variation, individual-level policy-driven changes, and non-fatal overdose. Project Narrative An unprecedented opiate crisis has emerged over the past decade in the U.S., and state governments have responded by implementing numerous policies to disrupt this trend. This study uses fixed effects modeling to determine which opiate-related policies have been effective in curbing opiate use, dependence, and fatal overdose by combining state-level data from the Center for Disease Control, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, and the new NIDA-funded Prescription Drug Abuse Policy System, which identifies policies related to naloxone access, prescription drug monitoring programs, Good Samaritan immunity, and medical marijuana. By examining the independent and interactive effects of policies, along with analyses of their effects by key demographic characteristics, this project has the potential to improve morbidity and mortality related to the opiate crisis as well as address health disparities related to this issue.",Effects of State-Level Policy Implementation on Opiate Abuse and Mortality,9574542,R21DA046447,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Censuses ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Crime ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Heroin ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Immunity ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Statistical Models ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Naloxone ', ' opioid abuse ', ' opioid drug abuse ', ' opiate drug abuse ', ' opiate abuse ', ' Overdose ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Societies ', ' State Government ', ' Provincial Government ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Pain Relief Units ', ' Pain Centers ', ' Pain Clinics ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Dependence ', ' System ', ' misuse of prescription only drugs ', ' prescription misuse ', ' prescription drug misuse ', ' nonmedical prescription drug use ', ' non-medical prescription drug use ', ' Prescription medication misuse ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' social inequality ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' Bypass ', ' prescription drug abuse ', ' prescription medication abuse ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' Outcome ', ' demographics ', ' prescription opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' opioid medication ', ' opiate medication ', ' licit opioid ', ' prescription opioid ', ' medicinal cannabis ', ' medical cannabis ', ' Medicinal Marijuana ', ' Medical Marijuana ', ' improved outcome ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opiate use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opioid use ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', ' Time trend ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opioid overdose ', ' opioid related death ', ' opioid overdose death ', ' opioid deaths ', ' opiate mortality ', ' opiate deaths ', ' opioid mortality ', ' heroin intake ', ' heroin use ', ' Prescription Drug Monitoring Program ', ' prescription monitoring program ', ' prescription opiate misuse ', ' opioid prescription medication misuse ', ' opioid medication misuse ', ' opioid analgesic misuse ', ' nonmedical use of prescription opioids ', ' nonmedical use of prescription opiates ', ' non-medical use of prescription opioids ', ' non-medical use of prescription opiates ', ' prescription opioid misuse ', ' ']",NIDA,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,243468,0.1321423894795368
"Vulnerability to Drug Use & HIV: Advancing Prevention for Rural African Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Center for Translational and Prevention Science (CTAPS) was funded in 2009 to inform the development of prevention programs for rural African American youth through investigations of gene environment (G-E) interplay on drug use and HIV-related behavior. The proposed continuation augments CTAPS' scientific agenda to better address racial disparities in drug use and HIV-related behavior that affect rural African Americans. Emerging research suggests that exposure to chronic stress affects the functioning of inflammatory, neuroendocrine, and neurocognitive systems beginning in childhood and adolescence. The negative consequences of chronic stress affect health-related behaviors and forecast chronic diseases of aging. Emerging evidence suggests that these processes also may affect youth and young adults' development of drug misuse and HIV related behavior. The Center will sponsor a new generation of research on (a) the neuroendocrine, inflammatory, and neurocognitive pathways through which exposure to stress among rural African American youth and young adults creates vulnerabilities to drug use and HIV related behavior, (b), the malleable risk and protective processes that affect underlying vulnerability mechanisms , and (c) the translation of findings into new and refined preventive interventions for youth in general and rural African American youth in particular. The CTAPS will pursue these scientific goals via providing infrastructure for three support cores (Inflammation/Neuroendocrine, Neurocognitive, Biostatistics) that will enrich data from data from Core projects and pilot projects and a Pilot Core. CTAPS will facilitate communication among Center-affiliated investigators, support core directors, and core project PIs; oversee administration of Center-wide budgets and operations; provide infrastructure and administrative support for three support cores and a Pilot Core. CTAPS will spur progress via a transdisciplinary work group system designed to facilitate transdisciplinary collaboration and to organize the allocation of Center resources and disseminate research findings to multiple stakeholders including researchers, policy makers, educational organizations, and the public.             The proposed Center is designed to investigate how chronic stress that rural African American's experience in childhood and adolescence affects drug misuse and HIV-related behavior in young adulthood.

"Optimizing Immunosuppression Drug Dosing via Phenotypic Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY The authors have developed a computational platform to rapidly identify optimal drug and dose combinations from the innumerable possibilities. By testing this technique termed Phenotypic Personalized Medicine (PPM) in a diverse number of experimental systems representing different diseases, they have found that the response of biological systems to drugs can be described by a low order, smooth multidimensional surface. The main consequence of this is that optimal drug combinations can be found in a small number of tests. This input–output relationship is always based on experimental data, not modeling, and it would lead to a straightforward solution for handling human diversity in drug dosing needs, among other clinical problems. They will test the hypothesis that PPM can be developed and validated for clinical use by conducting a prospective clinical trial to compare the feasibility and efficacy of this approach to standard of care physician dosing. This group has previously used PPM-based optimization to find novel drug combinations in in vitro and in vivo models of cancer and infection. In a first-in-human study, they recently compared 4 PPM-dosed patients and 4 control (standard of care dosed) patients. They calculated the tacrolimus dosing regimen using the PPM process and showed significant improvement in variability and a trend toward improved efficacy. For this application, they aim to show in a clinical trial, that PPM is more effective than unaided physician dosing. This will allow the generation of data to justify a multi-center confirmatory study and to explore a wider array of clinical outcomes to optimize. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project uses a computational drug-dose optimization platform (Phenotypic Precision Medicine) to an important problem in transplant immunosuppression, the maintenance of patient tacrolimus blood levels within a clinically desired target range. Using empiric measurements of responses to previously administered doses, the Phenotypic Precision Medicine platform optimizes and suggests subsequent doses. A prospective clinical trial will compare the efficacy, feasibility, and safety of this approach to standard of care physician dosing.",Optimizing Immunosuppression Drug Dosing via Phenotypic Precision Medicine,9432394,R21DK116140,"['Combination Medication ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Calcineurin antagonist ', ' Calcineurin inhibitor ', ' Output ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' human study ', ' Population ', ' visual map ', ' prospective ', ' trial comparing ', ' standard of care ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' biological systems ', ' risk minimization ', ' Regimen ', ' arm ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' novel pharmacotherapy combination ', ' new pharmacotherapy combination ', ' new drug combination ', ' novel drug combination ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subsets ', ' individual variability ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variation ', ' variation between patients ', ' variability between patients ', ' patient variation ', ' patient variability ', ' first in man ', ' first-in-human ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Combinations ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Goals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunosuppression ', ' immune suppression ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' liver transplantation ', ' Liver Transplant ', ' Liver Grafting ', ' Hepatic Transplantation ', ' Maintenance ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Physiology ', ' Safety ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Tacrolimus ', ' immunological markers ', ' immunological biomarkers ', ' immune-based biomarkers ', ' Immune Markers ', ' Immunologic Markers ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Surface ', ' Acute ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' liver function ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Immunological response ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Nature ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' Knowledge ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' response ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' in vivo Model ', ' CancerModel ', ' Cancer Model ', ' Clinical Data ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2018,169781,0.08600311335193023
"The Development and Evaluation of the Ho'ouna Pono Drug Prevention Curriculum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research has indicated that Native Hawaiian youth have significantly higher rates of drug use than their non-Hawaiian counterparts (e.g., Wong, Klingle, & Price, 2004; Mayeda, Hishinuma, Nishimura, Garcia- Santiago, & Mark, 2006; Nishimura, Hishinuma, & Goebert, 2013), and that these differences are particularly pronounced in rural settings (Lai & Saka, 2005). Despite these findings, there have been very few drug prevention programs developed and evaluated specifically for these youth (Edwards, Giroux, & Okamoto, 2010; Rehuher, Hiramatsu, & Helm, 2008). Therefore, the purpose of this research proposal is to complete the development of a video-enhanced, culturally grounded, school-based drug prevention curriculum for rural Native Hawaiian youth (Ho'ouna Pono), and to evaluate the curriculum across all public middle/intermediate schools on Hawai'i Island. This will be accomplished through three specific aims. AIM 1 (Year 1) is to complete the Ho'ouna Pono drug prevention curriculum initially developed and validated in a NIDA-funded translational pilot/feasibility study (R34 DA031306). To date, five professionally filmed video vignettes depicting drug-related problem situations specific to rural Hawaiian youth and seven interactive classroom lessons have been created, implemented in randomly selected intervention schools, and preliminarily evaluated using a pre-test, post-test control group design. Aim 1 enhances and builds upon this work by producing two new video vignettes, re-editing a ""Behind the Scenes"" video, developing new classroom curricular components, and synthesizing the new content with the existing curriculum. AIM 2 (Years 2-3) is to evaluate the fully conceived curriculum across all middle/intermediate schools on Hawai'i Island (N = 15) using a dynamic wait- listed control group design (Brown, Wyman, Guo, & Peña, 2006). AIM 3 (Year 4) is to assess community, systemic, and curricular factors related to the implementation, adoption, and sustainability of the curriculum within public middle/intermediate schools on Hawaii Island. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Because Hawaiians or part-Hawaiians represent the largest Pacific Islander population in the U.S. (Harris & Jones, 2005) and have recently been shown to have significantly higher rates of drug use compared with other ethnic groups (Wu et al., 2013), research focused on drug prevention of these individuals is important to improve public health both in Hawai'i and on the Mainland U.S. This study actively engages rural communities in the full-scale development and evaluation of the Ho'ouna Pono drug prevention curriculum for Hawaiian youth, promoting the overall utility and effectiveness of the intervention. Further, the findings from this study will point to the core content of prevention interventions for Hawaiian youth in rural communities, which should be applicable to other ethnic youth populations in Hawaii and the Pacific Rim, as well as Native youth populations on the Mainland U.S.",The Development and Evaluation of the Ho'ouna Pono Drug Prevention Curriculum,9473040,R01DA037836,"['Adoption ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Hawaii ', ' Island ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Rural Health ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Film ', ' Rural Community ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Hawaiian population ', ' Hawaiian ', ' Outcome Study ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Indigenous ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Drug Prevention Program ', ' native youth ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' health equity ', ' rural setting ', ' Native Hawaiian ', ' ']",NIDA,HAWAII PACIFIC UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,335056,0.11304276041447972
"Institute for Translational Research Education (ITRE) in Adolescent Drug Abuse Abstract The applicant proposes the continued development and expansion of a successful research education program for graduate level students and professionals to acquire innovative research skills to address drug abuse and related behavioral health concerns of children and adolescents. Implementation Science continues to be at the forefront of innovative research education; the Institute for Translational Research and Education in Adolescent Drug Abuse (ITRE) will focus on training clinical researchers in implementation research methods, translation of research into community practice, and the practical skills of participatory research. A cross-disciplinary approach, involving multiple colleges at the University of South Florida and Northern Arizona University, as well as local community service agencies, has been developed with special attention to evidence-based practice, translational research, and children and adolescents as an at-risk population. Our new emphasis is on addressing research education with an expanded target of behavioral health researchers with interests in working with at-risk populations including children and families of AI descent and Hispanic populations who have drug abuse and other co-morbid behavioral health conditions, defined as the array of mental, emotional and behavioral disorders of childhood that, along with drug abuse, have devastating effects on adolescent development.

"Health disparity in pharmacogenomics: African American SNPs and drug metabolism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As pharmacogenomics moves from bench-top to bed-side, African Americans have been left out of the advances personalized medicine holds. To date, African Americans have been largely absent from the numerous pharmacogenetic studies that identify predictive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are being used clinically to improve care. As we move toward more comprehensive bioinformatics and high- throughput methods of evaluating the genome for functionally relevant SNPs that affect drug phenotypes, we are also producing a growing health disparity in the translation of these findings into the clinic for African Americans. Current genomic methods are trying to reach beyond genome-wide association in hopes of finding biological plausibility to genetic findings. This search has led to the use of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) as a tool in pharmacogenetic association studies. SNPs labeled as eQTLs have intrinsic biological plausibility since they are significantly associated with changes in gene expression. However, no liver eQTL studies have been conducted in African Americans. By using liver-specific eQTLs, we will discover SNPs that affect drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs), which will have wide-spread scientific and clinical impact; given that most drugs currently prescribed undergo some form of hepatic metabolism. Because of the increase genetic diversity found in African Americans, they may carry population specific SNPs can never be found by pharmacogenomics studies in populations of European-descent alone. Without African American focused pharmacogenomics studies we risk excluding African Americans from personalized medicine. We plan to use primary hepatocytes to conduct gene expression studies both before and after drug enzyme induction to identify genes that are differentially expressed. Drug enzyme induction is driven by increased gene transcription; therefore, by focusing on the genes that are differentially expressed after induction we can pin-point the drivers (i.e. genes) that regulate drug metabolizing enzymes. We will then look at SNPs within and in close proximity to these genes to determine if any are associated with differences in gene expression (dubbed DI-eQTLs). We will then look to see if these DI-eQTLs are associated with pharmacokinetic measures in the same set of cell cultures, affectedly preforming a pharmacokinetic and a pharmacogenetic study in the same individual. We hypothesize that drug enzyme induction will provide us with DI-eQTLs that are strongly associated to drug pharmacokinetics, a clinically relevant phenotype. To validate these findings we will query publically available data to look for an enrichment of our DI-eQTLs within the most strongly associated SNPs in pharmacogenomic GWAS data. The association between genotype, gene expression and drug pharmacokinetics in African Americans has never been conducted before and will provide an invaluable resource for pharmacogenomics and clinical pharmacology, as well as clinical translation in this understudied population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed studies will help identify genetic mutations that affect drug metabolism in African Americans, an under-studied population in pharmacogenomics. The discovery of these novel mutations will lead to better dosing of drugs that require the liver for metabolism and potentially less side-effects from these medications. By studying the genetic mutations that affect drug metabolism in African Americans we can more fully incorporate this population into personalized medicine.",Health disparity in pharmacogenomics: African American SNPs and drug metabolism,9474053,R01MD009217,"['Affect ', ' Africa ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Beds ', ' Biology ', ' Cell Culture Techniques ', ' cell culture ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Environment ', ' Enzyme Induction ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' In Vitro ', ' Learning ', ' Linkage Disequilibrium ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mutation ', ' genome mutation ', ' Genetic defect ', ' Genetic Change ', ' Genetic Alteration ', ' Pharmacogenetics ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Clinical Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Adverse drug effect ', ' Drug Side Effects ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Caring ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Liver Cells ', ' Hepatic Parenchymal Cell ', ' Hepatic Cells ', ' Hepatocyte ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' European ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' American ', ' Quantitative Trait Loci ', ' QTL ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' drug metabolism ', ' drug clearance ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Genomics ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' genetic association ', ' liver metabolism ', ' hepatic metabolism ', ' Dose ', ' DNA Sequence Alteration ', ' genomic alteration ', ' Sequence Alteration ', ' Genetic mutation ', ' DNA mutation ', ' DNA Alteration ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Pathway ', ' Resolution ', ' in vivo ', ' Process ', ' protein function ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' GWAS ', ' GWA study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' Minority ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' Genetic study ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' differential expression ', ' interindividual variation ', ' inter-individual variability ', ' inter-individual variation ', ' study population ', ' clinical translation ', ' Predict drug response ', ' drug response prediction ', ' ']",NIMHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,395000,0.07890808701269215
"Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The Western States (WS) Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) promotes evidence-based drug abuse prevention and treatment services through continued participation in the CTN. The Node 1) designs and implements clinical trials of evidence-based treatments of addiction through rapid recruitment of diverse study participants in partnership with NIDA and the CTN, 2) generates peer-reviewed publications in collaboration with treatment providers and other nodes, and 3) uses the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Regional Research and Training Center includes talented faculty and staff from Oregon Health & Science Center and University of California, San Francisco as well as leaders of affiliated healthcare partners providing integrated primary care and substance use disorder treatment. The Node was created in 2010 as an amalgam of two CTN Nodes--California-Arizona and Oregon/Hawaii (a charter member of the CTN). The Node was highly successful, during the current award, participating in 10 CTN trials, co-leading two of these and leading one; reporting results of CTN main studies, ancillary, and research using the CTN platform in 100+ publications, and actively disseminating evidence- based practices in 200 presentations. Node investigators also sought and received awards for 10 studies that used the CTN as a platform for research. Eight WS Node healthcare programs recruited over 1,300 participants into CTN studies. In the coming grant period the Node expands to include three national and regional primary care and HIV primary care research networks: OCHIN, the HIV Research Network, and the Oregon Rural Practice-Based Research Network (ORPRN). The Node retains core addiction treatment centers experienced in CTN protocols and exploits their links with primary care: Adapt (Roseburg, OR), CODA (Portland, OR) HealthRIGHT 360 (San Francisco, CA), La Frontera (Tucson, AZ), NARA (Portland, OR), and Signal Behavioral Health Network (Denver, CO). The Node's research agenda proposes study concepts that evaluate three strategies to integrate and enhance addiction treatment within healthcare settings. Study 1 builds a patient registry for HCV infection and tests a multi-contact brief intervention for alcohol use. Study 2 extends the registry testing a candidate therapeutic HIV vaccine. Study 3, a test of reverse integration (primary care clinicians in addiction treatment settings), assesses naloxone distribution and education to reduce fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses and measures impact on return to use. Finally the WS Node continues to use the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Node has the potential to accelerate the advancement of integrated primary care and addiction in the coming years. PROJECT NARRATIVE This renewal application to conduct research in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network has broad public health implications focused on developing and testing ways to better treat medical problems and addiction through integrated care. The project will conduct clinical trials of treatments for drug use disorders in the context of primary care addressing hepatitis C, HIV, and opioid overdose--topics of urgent national importance.

Mounting evidence suggest that impaired neurocognitive functioning, exposure to early, severe, or chronic social disadvantage, and stress related to conflicting cultural practices, independently predict adverse drug use outcomes. Yet, studies employing an integrated approach to explore how these factors interact to increase or decrease the risk of experiencing adverse drug use consequences are limited. Therefore, the immediate and overarching goal of this K01 application is to receive intensive, supervised career-development training on the intersection between addiction neuroscience and social and cross-cultural research applied to drug use research that will enable me to pursue a line of independent research on drug use disparities. In this application, I propose to investigate how socio- cultural, neurocognitive and drug use related factors interact to explain the adverse outcomes seen in the Hispanic population. The specific aims of the proposed project include: 1) To determine whether neurocognitive factors (e.g., decision-making, episodic memory), mediate the associations between socio-cultural factors (e.g., early, severe, or chronic socio-economic disadvantage, ethnic discrimination, acculturative stress, Hispanic cultural values), and drug use outcomes (e.g. transition from use to drug use disorders, drug use trajectories, driving under the influence of drugs - DIU); 2) To examine whether socio-cultural factors moderate the associations between neurocognitive factors and drug use. These goals will be achieved by leveraging data, participants, and resources from an ongoing longitudinal study (parent study) that assesses decision-making and episodic memory in trajectories to cannabis addiction (R01DA031176), and interviewing a sub-sample of young Hispanics participating in the parent study and their parents or legal guardians (n=200 dyads). The proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will build on my expertise in drug use epidemiology with advanced training in: addiction neuroscience, social and cross-cultural research on drug use disparities, interdisciplinary research on cognitive neuroscience and socio-cultural research, advanced statistical methods for analyzing longitudinal data, and responsible conduct of research. Overseeing this training is my primary mentor Dr. Raul Gonzalez, an expert in addiction neuroscience, and my co-mentor Dr. Mario De La Rosa, an expert in cross-cultural research and drug use disparities. The proposed K01, which is responsive to two of the two priority focus areas identified in the 2016-2020 NIDA Strategic Plan, will provide me with the resources, training, mentoring and knowledge needed to establish myself as a scientist with expertise on the intersection between addiction neuroscience and public health, and to develop a long-term independent transdisciplinary research program aimed at reducing and eliminating drug use disparities across and within minority populations. Project narrative: Socio-cultural and neurocognitive factors are important and potentially modifiable determinants of drug use, yet research examining the how these factors interact to explain drug use disparities is scarce. The proposed K01 training will support a Hispanic new and early stage investigator to become an independent researcher and a leader in interdisciplinary research on drug use disparities. Specifically, the outlined project will contribute to understand how social factors, Hispanic cultural values, neurocognitive processes and drug use related factors interact to explain the adverse drug use outcomes seen in the growing and heterogeneous Hispanic population, which is essential to design effective drug use preventive interventions.","Drug use disparities among Hispanics: elucidating the complex interactions between socio-cultural, neurocognitive and drug use-related factors",9583204,K01DA046715,"['Affect ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Legal Guardians ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Student Dropouts ', ' School Dropouts ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Injury ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Exposure to ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' psychosocial ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Applied Research ', ' Applied Science ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' cultural values ', ' social ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' driving under influence ', ' ethnic discrimination ', ' theories ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cannabis ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' prevent drug use ', ' prevent drug addiction ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' early onset ', ' early initiation drug use ', ' early onset drug use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Cognitive remediation ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' cognitive development ', ' cannabis use ', ' THC use ', ' THC co-use ', ' marijuana use ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2018,153098,0.22159522634227913
"Strengthening Hispanic Families via NIDA Prevention Science DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): These application requests 5 years of K01 support to accelerate the NIDA-focused interdisciplinary research career development of Dr. Ruben Parra-Cardona, a clinician-researcher who seeks to become an independent NIDA prevention researcher committed to underserved Hispanic adolescents and families. His current research evaluates a cultural adaptation of an evidence-based parenting intervention for at-risk Hispanic families with young children (ages 4-11), for which there is potential distal NIDA impact such as reduced risk of starting to smoke tobacco or to use other drugs. Complete evidence on distal benefits of early randomized trial interventions of this type cannot be seen unless the scale of research shifts upward, as in multi-site trials, and unless the measurements include bio-assays to confirm self-report drug use, with probes for potential gene- intervention interactions. Based on the proposed K01 career training objectives, the applicant will acquire the necessary skills to develop an interdisciplinary program of prevention research, informed by epidemiological and biomedical science. During 75% protected time for career development toward independent R01 project leadership, core learning objectives will be met (e.g., RCR, FCOI, grants management). In addition to its core, the training plan has 5 tracks: (1) enhanced mastery of small sample parenting intervention research; (2) enhanced mastery of research design and measurements for larger sample multi-site NIDA prevention research on youth developmental trajectories leading toward NIDA outcomes; (3) enhanced mastery of data analysis for interdependent observations from multiple sites; (4) new learning about integration of biological assays in NIDA family intervention and prevention research via collaborations with expert NIH toxicologists and genetics researchers; (5) mastery of electronic technology complements to current 'in person' intervention delivery and program impact assessment. The proposed award is crucial now that the applicant has become K01-eligible via permanent residency.

"Ending HIV/AIDS among People Who Use Drugs: Overcoming Challenges This is a proposal to renew funding of the Center for Drug Use and HIV Research (CDUHR) for years 21- 25. Recent advances in HIV biomedical and behavioral science have been shown to reduce HIV incidence and allow HIV-positive persons to reach near-normal lifespans. These achievements have led UNAIDS, the US and several local governments to propose strategies for “Ending the HIV Epidemic”. Notwithstanding these successes, attaining this goal among people who use drugs (PWUD) will require addressing a number of important existing barriers. The overall theme of this renewal is “Ending HIV/AIDS among People who use Drugs: Overcoming Challenges”. We define Ending HIV/AIDS as reducing new infections and increasing the proportion of PWUD who are virally suppressed. To accomplish this, we have identified these research priorities, which directly address the most significant challenges: (1) Devise new strategies to overcome emerging and persistent barriers to ending HIV/AIDS among PWUD. Barriers include recent increases in prescription opioid misuse, which have given rise to a new generation of heroin user and injectors, and lack of attention to the key role of substance use in new infections in men who have sex with men and heterosexuals. HIV-positive PWUD also experience disparities all along the continuum of HIV care, including delayed diagnosis, lower retention in care, delayed initiation of ART and poorer disease outcomes. (2) Conduct research on effective ways to broadly implement evidence-based interventions. HIV prevention and care programs for PWUD do not exist in many regions of the US and the rest of the world where they are needed most, and they are rarely implemented at public-health scale. (3) Develop new, innovative models of prevention and treatment interventions to address substance-use related disparities in HIV infection and treatment outcomes that take into account the complex, multilevel nature of HIV among PWUD.  We have made significant changes in our scope and structure for this renewal, and we will achieve our aims through five Cores, an Administrative Core and four Research Support Cores: (1) Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Theory, (2) Transdisciplinary Research Methods, (3) Dissemination and Implementation, and (4) Pilot Projects and Mentoring. These Cores support our research base and affiliated investigators to conduct cutting-edge science and enhance synergy across investigators from multiple disciplines, thereby leading to contributions to the field that are beyond what the individual projects could have achieved. In addition to the many successful initiatives that have been developed over CDUHR's history, new activities were added to respond to the evolving needs of our investigators. Also, in addition to our ongoing commitment to train new investigators to conduct high-impact research, we will collaborate with investigators in areas where HIV epidemics are occurring among PWUD (in rural and middle America, and in eastern Europe and Asia), building on our collective knowledge and expertise to advance toward Ending HIV/AIDS in those regions. Project Narrative A critical time has been reached in the course of the HIV epidemic, when the possibility to end HIVAIDS has been raised. Despite advances in biomedical treatments and behavioral interventions to reduce HIV incidence and its impact, people who use drugs (PWUD) have poorer outcomes. The Center provides a research infrastructure to enhance the productivity, synergy and impact of the research by affiliated investigators working to End HIV/AIDS among PWUD.",Ending HIV/AIDS among People Who Use Drugs: Overcoming Challenges,9197847,P30DA011041,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Americas ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Communities ', ' Heroin ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Services ', ' diagnosis service ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Epidemic ', ' Eastern Europe ', ' Evolution ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Far East ', ' Eastern Asia ', ' East Asia ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Greece ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Indiana ', ' Infection ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Local Government ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' New York ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Time ', ' ranpirnase ', ' P30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' Generations ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Nature ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Distant ', ' Route ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Viral ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' persons who inject drugs ', ' people who inject illicit drugs ', ' people who inject drugs ', ' PWID ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' Heroin Users ', ' austin ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' prevention service ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Infectious Disease Epidemiology ', ' Infectious Epidemiology ', ' International ', ' Interruption ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' public health research ', ' recruit ', ' treatment services ', ' Injections ', ' heroin intake ', ' heroin use ', ' prescription opiate misuse ', ' opioid prescription medication misuse ', ' opioid medication misuse ', ' opioid analgesic misuse ', ' nonmedical use of prescription opioids ', ' nonmedical use of prescription opiates ', ' non-medical use of prescription opioids ', ' non-medical use of prescription opiates ', ' prescription opioid misuse ', ' ']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,P30,2018,1549182,0.059589963761982494
"Reducing Black Men's Drug Use and Co-Occurring Negative Mental and Physical Health Outcomes: Intersectionality, Social-Structural Stressors, and Protective Factors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health inequities among Black men in the U.S. are stark. Drug use contributes to six of the top ten leading causes of death among Black men ages 18 to 54. Social-structural stressors such as discrimination, based on race or race and sexual identity, and drug use to cope with stress, are well-documented pathways to drug use among Black adults. Empirical evidence that drug use co-occurs with other negative health outcomes underscores an urgent public health need to examine drug use and other co-occurring negative health outcomes associated with social-structural stressors. Single-axis perspectives—either race or sexual identity— dominate drug use and health disparities research. Apart from HIV/AIDS research, research on the effects of social-structural stressors on Black men’s drug use and co-occurring negative health outcomes at the intersection of sexual identity (i.e., heterosexual, sexual minority) and socioeconomic position (SEP) is virtually nonexistent. Critical gaps also exist about how protective factors (e.g., resilience, religiosity, positive racial/sexual identity) influence the effects of social-structural stressors on Black men’s drug use and co- occurring negative health outcomes. To address these critical gaps, a longitudinal cross-lagged explanatory- sequential (QUANT→qual) mixed methods study is proposed to test, via structural equation modeling, a conceptual model of social-structural stressors, protective factors, and drug use (alcohol, marijuana, nicotine, illicit drug use) and co-occurring negative mental (e.g., psychological distress) and physical (e.g., blood pressure) health outcomes among Black men at the intersection of sexual identity and SEP. Purposive quota sampling will be used to recruit 960 Black men, ages 18-54, stratified by sexual identity and SEP (240/group) in Washington, DC. Phase I includes the collection of self-reported social-structural stressors, protective factors, drug use, and mental health data, and objective drug use (i.e., urine toxicology) and physical health (e.g., blood pressure) data at Time 1, and 3 months later at Time 2 (Aims 1, 2). Blood samples will be collected at Time 2 only to assess cardiovascular disease biomarkers (e.g., total cholesterol). Phase II includes 4 focus groups with 6-8 Phase I participants (total n = 24 to 32) purposively sampled to explain Phase I results (Aim 3). Phase III involves a synthesis and validity assessment of the quantitative and qualitative results (Aim 3). The proposed research uses intersectionality, social-structural stress, and resilience theoretical frameworks to advance new and important knowledge about the extent to which social-structural stressors and protective factors influence drug use and co-occurring negative health outcomes among Black men at the intersection of sexual identity and SEP. This intersectional focus represents a paradigmatic shift from conventional single-axis and one-size-fits-all intervention approaches. The significance of the proposed research lies in the expected outcome of the future development of multi-level (i.e., individual and social-structural) interventions to reduce drug use and promote mental and physical health among Black men at different intersectional positions of risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed explanatory-sequential (QUANT→qual) mixed-methods longitudinal cross-lagged study is relevant to public health because, in alignment with the NIDA Epidemiology Research Branch’s mission, it advances new knowledge about the effects of social-structural stressors and protective factors on drug use and co-occurring negative mental and physical health outcomes for Black men at the intersection of sexual identity and socioeconomic position (SEP). A significant benefit of the proposed research is that it will have broad translational importance for future health disparities research and interventions designed to reduce drug use and health disparities among and between populations at multiple marginalized intersectional positions (e.g., race, gender, sexual identity, and SEP). The project advances new horizons about the effects of intersectional positions and related social-structural stressors and protective factors on drug use and co- occurring negative mental and physical health outcomes that conventional single-axis (e.g., either race or sexual identity) approaches obscure.","Reducing Black Men's Drug Use and Co-Occurring Negative Mental and Physical Health Outcomes: Intersectionality, Social-Structural Stressors, and Protective Factors",9496881,R01DA045773,"['21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Homicide ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nicotine ', ' Political Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Washington ', ' Gender ', ' Police ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Accidental Injury ', ' Unintentional Injury ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Area ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Phase ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Gays ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Social status ', ' social standing ', ' social position ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' virtual ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' stress resilience ', ' Population ', "" men's health "", ' male health ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' sexual minority ', ' health data ', ' illicit drug use ', ' intersectionality ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' ']",NIDA,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,727210,0.10473788718971687
"Cohort Studies on HIV/AIDS and Substance Abuse in Miami ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Liver disease is a major cause of death in HIV infected persons in the United States. While advances in antiretroviral therapy have significantly reduced HIV-related mortality, co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), is widespread and accelerates progression of liver fibrosis to cirrhosis and liver carcinoma. In addition, substance abuse accelerates HIV disease, and may facilitate progression of liver fibrosis. The primary goal of this proposal is to continue to follow the existing Miami Adult Studies on HIV (MASH) cohort, its specimen repository and database, and expand it from the current 881 to 1,500 study participants. The purpose is to generate collaborative studies to investigate the impact of cocaine, by far the most prevalent drug of abuse in South Florida, on HIV infection, HIV/HCV co-infection, and on long-term morbidity with a focus on liver disease in this population with disparities in access to care. HIV and HCV un-infected cocaine users and non-users will also be recruited to allow determination of the impact of cocaine use alone, as well as the interaction of cocaine use with HIV, HCV, and HIV/HCV co-infection. As new and more effective treatments and access to care for HIV, HCV and drug abuse become available, maintaining a well- characterized cohort, specimen repository and database will create a strong resource platform for current and future collaborative research. Observing the uptake of new HCV treatments and potential new cocaine cessation programs in this at-risk population with health disparities will provide data on barriers and facilitators to effective treatments to prevent long-term morbidity and mortality. We have followed the MASH cohort of 881 participants for up to 12 years with excellent retention rates, and have created a specimen repository and a database. The MASH cohort in Miami is unique because it will be a mostly Hispanic cohort with a large number of African Americans, women, non-injector drug users, with predominantly heterosexual HIV- transmission etiology. We propose to (1) compare the progression of liver fibrosis over four years among cocaine users and non-users in HIV+/HCV-, HIV+/HCV+, HIV-/HCV+, and HIV-/HCV-, using a novel non- invasive diagnostic device, the Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE). We also propose to (2) compare the pattern over four years of biomarkers and identify genetic markers associated with the mechanisms of liver fibrosis among cocaine users and non-users. Understanding the role of cocaine use in the context of HIV and HIV/HCV co-infections and lack of lasting effects of treatments for cocaine use cessation are crucial in order to gain insights into the pathogenesis and disease outcomes, and to provide the basis for identifying antifibrotic therapies such as oxidative stress, which are amenable to intervention.

"Frailty, HIV Infection, Injection Drug Use and the Inflammatory-Microbiome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), life expectancy for HIV-infected persons has markedly improved, yet marked deficits in survival remain for HIV-infected persons with a history of injecting drugs (PWID). Disparities among PWID have been attributed in part to a shifting spectrum of disease to aging-associated conditions driven by persistent inflammation even with ART. Frailty is an important aging-related state of vulnerability to stress, with an increased burden in HIV infection, strongly associated with heightened inflammation, and predictive of premature mortality and aging-related morbidity among PWID. Injecting drugs itself can increase the severity of inflammation in HIV. The human gut microbial ecosystem (gut microbiome) critically regulates inflammation and immunity. Alterations in the gut microbiome (gut dysbiosis) together with associated disruptions of gut structure and immune integrity constitute an inflammatory-microbiome signature (gut dysbiosis, increased gut permeability, translocation of microbial products, immune activation, heightened inflammation) linked to adverse aging-associated inflammatory conditions and disease. Proposed is a systematic investigation of the role of HIV infection and injection drug use (IDU) in defining the inflammatory- microbiome signature and determination of the relationship of this signature to frailty. Through assessments of the fecal and mucosal microbiome in the AIDS Linked to the IntraVenous Experience (ALIVE) cohort of HIV- infected and epidemiologically comparable HIV-uninfected PWID, we will determine how HIV infection and active IDU alter microbiome composition and function and the relationship of these changes to inflammation and frailty progression over time. Using a germ free murine model, we will further define the frail human microbial communities and gene products that precipitate inflammation. These studies will facilitate elucidation of gut microbial determinants of frailty among HIV-infected PWID and could significantly inform microbiota modulation strategies to reduce frailty-associated inflammation beyond ART. Understanding the role of the gut microbiome in relation to HIV, injection drug use, and frailty remains a critical next step to reducing the marked disparities in clinical outcomes among HIV-infected PWID. PROJECT NARRATIVE Persons co-impacted by HIV infection and drug use are living longer with effective antiretroviral therapy, but many still die much earlier and experience a heavy burden of frailty and age-related disease. We seek to understand how microbes in the gut may be linked to inflammation, how this process may be impacted by HIV and injection drug use, and how these factors may contribute to age-related diseases or frailty. Knowledge gained from these studies could inform development of effective strategies to improve survival and quality of life for persons aging with HIV infection and drug use.","Frailty, HIV Infection, Injection Drug Use and the Inflammatory-Microbiome",9623754,R01AG060825,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' cell motility ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cocaine ', ' Colon ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Heroin ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Gene Pool ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunity ', ' Inflammation ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Liver diseases ', ' liver disorder ', ' hepatopathy ', ' hepatic disease ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' Morbidity -

"Racial and ethnic disparities in alcohol and other drug use disorder recovery (F.220) 7. Project Summary Racial/ethnic health disparities have been well-documented in the onset, rate, course, and consequences of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use problems, often with substantially poorer outcomes in non-White racial/ethnic groups compared to non-Hispanic Whites. As a result, the NIAAA has made it a central strategic aim to investigate and eliminate health disparities. Despite 30 years of research documenting the presence of AOD-related racial/ethnic health disparities, the degree to which disparities negatively impact the emerging standard of assessing the effectiveness of AOD treatments (i.e., ≥ 5 years AOD problem resolution),53 which is also when risk of problematic use is no higher than in the general population,84 is unknown. Publicly available datasets are very limited by their ability to directly measure AOD recovery-related constructs and national prevalence rates of non-White racial/ethnic groups who have achieved long-term problem resolution. In turn, this compromises our ability to assess the extent to which racial/ethnic health equality exists in terms of long- term AOD problem resolution and the recovery-related mechanisms associated with potential disparities. To begin to fill this knowledge gap, we propose to conduct secondary data analyses of the first recovery-focused nationally representative probability-based study to test if racial/ethnic health disparities exist. The National Recovery Study (PI: Kelly) consists of a web-based probability sampling frame of 39,809 adults who were screened to identify if they once had a problem with drugs or alcohol and no longer do. Complete data on 2,002 participants who answered “yes” is available. Participants were assessed with a battery of quantitative and qualitative survey items in 2016 which captured their AOD clinical history and recovery-related mechanisms associated racial/ethnic health equality in AOD problem resolution. This design will enable us to address the following aims: 1a. Test if racial/ethnic health disparities exist in (i) the duration between onset of alcohol and other drug problems and onset of problem resolution; and, (ii) the likelihood of achieving long-term problem resolution (≥ 5 years) 1b. If health disparities are observed, explore the mediating potential of psychosocial (accrued recovery capital, degree of treatment utilization, degree of recovery support-service utilization) and structural recovery-related factors (health insurance coverage, socioeconomic status, and recovery-related discrimination) in explaining observed disparities. 2. Conduct concurrent qualitative analysis to identify the top three strategies that participants report having used to resolve their alcohol or other drug problem (e.g., social support, secure accommodations, mental and physical health, financial management, employment, and recreation) and compare these strategies according to racial/ethnic characteristics. Mix the qualitative and quantitative data to determine if race/ethnicity is associated with themes identified in the recovery strategies. (F.220) 8. Project Narrative Despite 30 years of research documenting the disproportionate burden that alcohol and other drug (AOD)- related problems have on non-White racial/ethnic groups, the degree to which racial/ethnic health disparities negatively impact emerging standards for assessing the effectiveness of AOD treatments (≥ 5 years AOD problem resolution), which is when the risk of problematic use is no higher than in the general population, is unknown. This F32 postdoctoral training will aid the applicant in documenting US prevalence estimates of the number of non-White individuals who have resolved an AOD problem using data from the first nationally representative, probability-based, study of recovery. Specifically, the candidate will investigate the associations between race/ethnicity and stages of AOD problem resolution in the: 1. duration between onset of AOD problems and onset of problem resolution; and, 2. the likelihood of achieving stable long-term problem resolution. In doing so, we will establish the first line of nationally representative research on health equality in long-term AOD problem resolution and associated recovery-related mechanisms, ultimately translating findings into actionable targets for clinicians, policy, and public health proposals that can address the identified disparities.",Racial and ethnic disparities in alcohol and other drug use disorder recovery,9572386,F32AA025823,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Capital ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Occupational activity of managing finances ', ' Financial Management ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Probability ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recreation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Severities ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' Outcome ', ' alcohol related problem ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' NIAAA ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' service utilization ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' alcohol consequences ', ' Secure ', ' screening ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' service programs ', ' ']",NIAAA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,F32,2018,67858,0.037463982941195906

"Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  The Western States (WS) Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) promotes evidence-based drug abuse prevention and treatment services through continued participation in the CTN. The Node 1) designs and implements clinical trials of evidence-based treatments of addiction through rapid recruitment of diverse study participants in partnership with NIDA and the CTN, 2) generates peer-reviewed publications in collaboration with treatment providers and other nodes, and 3) uses the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Regional Research and Training Center includes talented faculty and staff from Oregon Health & Science Center and University of California, San Francisco as well as leaders of affiliated healthcare partners providing integrated primary care and substance use disorder treatment. The Node was created in 2010 as an amalgam of two CTN Nodes--California-Arizona and Oregon/Hawaii (a charter member of the CTN). The Node was highly successful, during the current award, participating in 10 CTN trials, co-leading two of these and leading one; reporting results of CTN main studies, ancillary, and research using the CTN platform in 100+ publications, and actively disseminating evidence- based practices in 200 presentations. Node investigators also sought and received awards for 10 studies that used the CTN as a platform for research. Eight WS Node healthcare programs recruited over 1,300 participants into CTN studies. In the coming grant period the Node expands to include three national and regional primary care and HIV primary care research networks: OCHIN, the HIV Research Network, and the Oregon Rural Practice-Based Research Network (ORPRN). The Node retains core addiction treatment centers experienced in CTN protocols and exploits their links with primary care: Adapt (Roseburg, OR), CODA (Portland, OR) HealthRIGHT 360 (San Francisco, CA), La Frontera (Tucson, AZ), NARA (Portland, OR), and Signal Behavioral Health Network (Denver, CO). The Node's research agenda proposes study concepts that evaluate three strategies to integrate and enhance addiction treatment within healthcare settings. Study 1 builds a patient registry for HCV infection and tests a multi-contact brief intervention for alcohol use. Study 2 extends the registry testing a candidate therapeutic HIV vaccine. Study 3, a test of reverse integration (primary care clinicians in addiction treatment settings), assesses naloxone distribution and education to reduce fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses and measures impact on return to use. Finally the WS Node continues to use the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Node has the potential to accelerate the advancement of integrated primary care and addiction in the coming years. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This renewal application to conduct research in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network has broad public health implications focused on developing and testing ways to better treat medical problems and addiction through integrated care. The project will conduct clinical trials of treatments for drug use disorders in the context of primary care addressing hepatitis C, HIV, and opioid overdose--topics of urgent national importance. This research can accelerate the advancement of providing integrated treatments for medical problems and addiction in the coming years.",Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment

"Couples-based intervention to reduce drug use and HIV transmission Project Summary YMSM in relationships with other men face unique and compounded risk factors for both drug use and HIV infection. Their vulnerability is unique from older MSM, unpartnered MSM and their heterosexual peers. This enhanced vulnerability emerges as exactly the developmental period when the establishment of romantic relationships emerges as salient. Despite their unique vulnerability for HIV infection and challenges related to drug use, there are very few couples- based intervention options for YMSM. There are presently no brief, couples-based interventions which integrate a focus on drug use and HIV prevention. The proposed study is geared toward the development of such an intervention. The only individually delivered intervention for YMSM to show significant reductions in both drug use and sexual HIV transmission risk behavior, the Young Men’s Health Project (YMHP) was developed by members of this research team. YMHP focused on sexual risk in the context of casual partners. Beginning with this framework, our team has completed the initial stages of revising YMHP for use with couples, resulting in the creation of the Couple’s Health Project (CHP). Our formative work suggests that the prototype intervention is feasible and acceptable to participants. The next step is to develop components of the intervention which address pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake and to determine how best to integrate biological testing for STI’s and drug use into the study. The new intervention will be informed by qualitative data gathered from intervention sessions delivered in our formative work and from qualitative interviews conducted with 20 HIV negative partnered YMSM. The final 28 months of the project are devoted to a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing CHP to an attention-matched educational control condition. The study team is led by Dr. Tyrel J. Starks (PI), a new investigator with substantial experience in the study of gay male couples. He has collaborated on numerous projects examining the nature of sexual agreements and their association with substance use and HIV transmission risk behavior. He is supported by a study team which includes Dr. Jeffrey Parsons, the PI of the original YMHP study. The team brings extensive experience in quantitative and qualitative data analysis, HIV prevention research, and specifically intervention development. Project Narrative – Public Health Significance HIV prevention strategies that address the specific needs of YMSM in stable relationships with other men are needed in response to accumulating evidence which points to the unique vulnerability of these men. The proposed project builds upon an effective individual intervention, the Young Men’s Health Project, to develop a couples-based intervention which addresses drug use and sexual HIV transmission risk among partnered HIV negative YMSM (ages 18-29). Preliminary work by our research team has produced a prototype manual, and provided compelling evidence of feasibility and acceptability. The proposed project will revise this prototype manual to enhance the focus on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and to incorporate biological testing for drug use and STIs into the study. During Phase II, a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 50 couples will test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the new intervention relative to an attention-matched educational control.",Couples-based intervention to reduce drug use and HIV transmission,9458721,R34DA043422,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amphetamines ', ' dl-Amphetamine ', ' Phenopromin ', ' Phenamine ', ' Desoxynorephedrin ', ' Attention ', ' Chlamydia ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Communication ', ' Counseling ', ' Couples ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Ketamine ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Motivation ', ' Nitrates ', ' NO3- ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Crack Cocaine ', ' free base cocaine ', ' Latino ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' ecstasy ', ' N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine ', ' N,alpha-dimethyl-1,3-benzodioxole-5-ethanamine ', ' Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ', ' MDMA ', ' 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Fingernail ', ' Finger Nail ', ' Structure of nail of finger ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Gays ', ' uptake ', ' Anal Sex ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Couples Therapy ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Nature ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' 4-hydroxybutyric acid ', ' gamma-hydroxybutyric acid ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' prevention service ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Update ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Preparation ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', "" men's health "", ' male health ', ' trial comparing ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' prototype ', ' standard of care ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' follow up assessment ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' young man ', ' same-sex couple ', ' same sex relationship ', ' same sex partner ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' sexual HIV transmission ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' efficacy study ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIDA,HUNTER COLLEGE,R34,2018,296400,0.0832515560440776
"Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  The Western States (WS) Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) promotes evidence-based drug abuse prevention and treatment services through continued participation in the CTN. The Node 1) designs and implements clinical trials of evidence-based treatments of addiction through rapid recruitment of diverse study participants in partnership with NIDA and the CTN, 2) generates peer-reviewed publications in collaboration with treatment providers and other nodes, and 3) uses the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Regional Research and Training Center includes talented faculty and staff from Oregon Health & Science Center and University of California, San Francisco as well as leaders of affiliated healthcare partners providing integrated primary care and substance use disorder treatment. The Node was created in 2010 as an amalgam of two CTN Nodes--California-Arizona and Oregon/Hawaii (a charter member of the CTN). The Node was highly successful, during the current award, participating in 10 CTN trials, co-leading two of these and leading one; reporting results of CTN main studies, ancillary, and research using the CTN platform in 100+ publications, and actively disseminating evidence- based practices in 200 presentations. Node investigators also sought and received awards for 10 studies that used the CTN as a platform for research. Eight WS Node healthcare programs recruited over 1,300 participants into CTN studies. In the coming grant period the Node expands to include three national and regional primary care and HIV primary care research networks: OCHIN, the HIV Research Network, and the Oregon Rural Practice-Based Research Network (ORPRN). The Node retains core addiction treatment centers experienced in CTN protocols and exploits their links with primary care: Adapt (Roseburg, OR), CODA (Portland, OR) HealthRIGHT 360 (San Francisco, CA), La Frontera (Tucson, AZ), NARA (Portland, OR), and Signal Behavioral Health Network (Denver, CO). The Node's research agenda proposes study concepts that evaluate three strategies to integrate and enhance addiction treatment within healthcare settings. Study 1 builds a patient registry for HCV infection and tests a multi-contact brief intervention for alcohol use. Study 2 extends the registry testing a candidate therapeutic HIV vaccine. Study 3, a test of reverse integration (primary care clinicians in addiction treatment settings), assesses naloxone distribution and education to reduce fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses and measures impact on return to use. Finally the WS Node continues to use the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Node has the potential to accelerate the advancement of integrated primary care and addiction in the coming years. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This renewal application to conduct research in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network has broad public health implications focused on developing and testing ways to better treat medical problems and addiction through integrated care. The project will conduct clinical trials of treatments for drug use disorders in the context of primary care addressing hepatitis C, HIV, and opioid overdose--topics of urgent national importance. This research can accelerate the advancement of providing integrated treatments for medical problems and addiction in the coming years.",Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment

"Evaluating the Effectiveness of an eHealth EBI for Latino Youth in Primary Care Hispanic adolescents in the U.S. experience significant health disparities, particularly as it relates to drug use, unsafe sexual behaviors and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In spite of these disparities, a paucity of effective preventive interventions exist for Hispanic adolescents, and even fewer have been disseminated widely (IOM/NRC, 2009). Given that primary care settings are increasingly becoming the entry-point through which parents bring youth with behavioral health concerns, adolescent primary care settings represent ideal, yet underutilized, settings in which to disseminate evidence-based preventive interventions. Preventive interventions which target risk and protective factors within the family, the most proximal and fundamental social system influencing human behavior, have been found to be among the most efficacious interventions in preventing and reducing drug use and sexual risk behaviors.  Familias Unidas is a Hispanic-specific, family-based intervention found to be efficacious and effective in preventing and reducing drug use, sexual risk behaviors, and self-reported STIs. Familias Unidas has been cited by the Institute of Medicine report on Preventing, Emotional, and Behavioral among Young People as ready for broad dissemination (IOM/NRC, 2009). To date, however, Familias Unidas has been only tested for efficacy and effectiveness in schools and has not been evaluated for efficacy/effectiveness in primary care. We have adapted and evaluated Familias Unidas for online delivery; successfully retaining 80% of Hispanic parents and their youth (recruited from schools) in the online, eHealth adaptation of Familias Unidas. We have also demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of delivering eHealth Familas Unidas in primary care.  Evaluating innovative eHealth family-based interventions for Hispanic youth whose feasibility and acceptability is established in primary care settings is timely and of high public health significance. Therefore, the proposed study's overarching aim is to evaluate the relative effectiveness and cost effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas, compared to a referral to the National Institute Drug Abuse’s (NIDA) online information page for parents of Hispanic youth (referred hereafter as NIDA Online Information). To test the effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care in preventing drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and STIs in a universal sample of Hispanic youth, this study will randomize 456 Hispanic youth and their parents to eHealth Familias Unidas or to NIDA Online Information. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months post baseline. Study hypotheses are that: 1) eHealth Familias Unidas will be effective, relative to NIDA Online Information, in preventing/reducing drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and STI incidence in Hispanic adolescents over time and 2) Intervention effects will be partially mediated by family functioning for drug use and unprotected sexual behavior and by family functioning and unprotected sexual behavior for STI incidence. The cost effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas over a three year follow up will also be estimated. The proposed study will evaluate the effectiveness of an eHealth adaptation of an evidence-based face-to- face preventive intervention for Hispanic youth, in preventing drug use, sexual risk behaviors, and sexually transmitted diseases in primary care settings. The knowledge expected to be gained in this study will have strong implications for the delivery of prevention interventions in primary care, as well as contribute to the reduction of drug and sexual risk behavior related to disparities seen in Hispanic youth.",Evaluating the Effectiveness of an eHealth EBI for Latino Youth in Primary Care,9473043,R01DA040756,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Chlamydia ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Counselor ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Family ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Leadership ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Parents ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Staff Attitudes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Emotional disorder ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' junior high school ', ' middle school ', ' junior high ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' prevent drug use ', ' prevent drug addiction ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' e-Health ', ' eHealth ', ' parent-adolescent communication ', ' relative effectiveness ', ' relative cost ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,717999,0.07929300962446643

"Health Consequences of Drug Use and IPV Trajectories for Young Latinas ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Few empirical studies have documented the life trajectories of gang-affiliated adolescent females and the long- term health consequences of adolescent drug use and partner violence victimization. The purpose of this study is to identify and determine how distinct drug use and intimate partner violence victimization trajectories that emerge in adolescence through young adulthood contribute to physical and mental health outcomes among Mexican American women within the context of a highly disadvantaged community. This group of women are particularly vulnerable given they have low rates of access and utilization of health care, are the most likely age group to be uninsured, and represent a nexus of risk, vulnerability and potentially high costs to communities given their reproductive and sexual health stage of life. This application proposes a 15 year follow up of a cohort of Mexican American adolescent females previously identified in a CDC funded study who were affiliated with male gang members during their adolescence and involved in high rates of drug use and victims of intimate partner violence. Building upon the research teams previous studies and using analytical tools from the theory of gender and power and social bonding theory, this application will implement a concurrent mixed methods nested design approach to provide a comprehensive understanding of the long-term consequences of drug use and IPV. The sample will consist of 300 young adult Mexican-American females. The specific aims for this study are: 1) determine the prevalence of physical (cardiovascular and metabolic risk markers and STI infection) and mental (depression, PTSD, anxiety/stress) health outcomes; 2) identify and characterize distinct drug use and IPV trajectories from adolescence through young adulthood; 3) determine whether sexual relationship power and family social bonds during distinct age-graded stages alter drug use and IPV trajectories and health outcomes; and 4) characterize qualitatively the culture and community context and their influence on drug use and IPV trajectories over the life course. This research will have an important positive impact by identifying women who are at the highest risk for developing harmful drug and IPV trajectories as they transition into young adulthood. In doing this, we will lay the foundation for identifying critical points of behavioral intervention during key age-graded periods as well as culturally and contextually appropriate values and strategies that will reduce health disparities among similar high-risk female populations that have gone underrepresented in existing research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This application seek a comprehensive understanding of the long term health consequences of drug use and intimate partner violence victimization physical and mental health outcomes among a vulnerable cohort of Mexican-American females recruited over 15 years ago who were affiliated with male gang members during their adolescence.

"Y2Prevent: Preventing Drug Use and HIV through Empowerment, Social Support and Mentorship ABSTRACT African Americans represent only 14% of the population, but account for 44% of all new HIV infections reported yearly. The situation is particularly grave for Black/African American young men who have sex with men (AAYMSM), with seroprevalence rates of 19% for ages 15-22 and 26% for ages 23-29 among AAYMSM. These health outcomes are influenced by important social and structural factors, including violence and victimization, homophobia, discrimination, institutional racism, and economic and social marginalization. These experiences are significantly associated with illicit drug use, alcohol misuse, transactional sex work, and HIV risk behaviors. In response to this crisis, we are proposing to create a new theoretically driven, youth- centered intervention designed to build the capacity of AAYMSM to overcome these barriers to health. With this revised R34 application, we propose to further refine and pilot test an intervention, called Young Men's Adult Identity Mentoring (YM-AIM). Adapted from an existing CDC Diffusing Effective Behavioral Intervention, YM-AIM is a theory-driven, group-level intervention designed to help AAYMSM develop a healthy vision for their future (or “possible future self”) by defining a set of short- and long-term goals in the areas of education, health, family and intimate relationships. We propose to further strengthen and refine YM-AIM by adding a youth mentoring/support component, called Youth Initiated Mentoring (YIM). YIM uses a positive youth development framework to: a) build social capital to achieve immediate and long-term goals, b) build social support, c) identify and engage natural mentors in one's networks to address structural barriers, and d) develop relationships with supportive adults. We will integrate these two models into a single intervention called Y2Prevent. We will then work to further adapt, tailor, and evaluate Y2Prevent as an intervention to reduce illicit drug use and HIV/STI risk among AAYMSM. This intervention will emphasize: a) biomedical HIV prevention strategies for primary prevention, b) HIV/STI testing and treatment referral, c) drug screening and treatment referral, and d) positive youth development and future planning. We will conduct formative research to inform the adaptation/tailoring followed by a piloting of the new intervention to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and the preliminary efficacy. Our proposed positive youth development and resilience theory provide a strong, innovative framework for examining how AAYMSM with significant exposure to syndemic health and social disparities respond to engagement with prevention and treatment resources. The proposed intervention is intended to promote resilience, build social skills and assets among AAYMSM to help them recognize and overcome individual, social and structural barriers leading to risk, and adopt and maintain protective behaviors, such as safer sex, PrEP/PEP use, HIV/STI testing and healthcare utilization. The findings will inform the development of an R01 application that will propose a larger-scale, multi-city efficacy trail in a subsequent R01 application. PROJECT NARRATIVE Today there is a generation of African American/Black young men who have sex with men (AAYMSM) who are at exceedingly high risk for a wide range of adverse health outcomes, including tobacco, alcohol and illicit drug addiction, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV/AIDS, and mental health disorders. Often, these young men experience multiple forms of discrimination (racism, homophobia) in multiple settings (home, school, neighborhood, workplace), with limited social support to buffer against these threats. In response, we propose to further refine and pilot test a theory-driven, evidence-based group-level intervention designed to help AAYMSM develop a healthy vision for their future (or “possible future self”) by defining a set of short- and long- term goals in the areas of education, health, family and intimate relationships using facilitated activities -- participants are asked to consider how their involvement in risky behaviors (e.g., illicit drug use, condomless sex, multiple sex partners) would interfere with achieving those goals.","Y2Prevent: Preventing Drug Use and HIV through

"Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for Drug Abuse and HIV (Ce-PIM) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application is for a competing renewal of the Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for HIV and Drug Abuse, a NIDA P30 Center of Excellence. The number of new HIV cases in the US remains stable at 56,000 per year and continues to disproportionately affect some groups, including young men who have sex with men (YMSM), especially from racial/ethnic minorities. The purpose of this methodology center is to develop new methodologies that can be used by federal and local agencies and communities to reduce HIV incidence. Biomedical interventions and strategies, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), rapid testing for HIV and early and consistent treatment for persons who are HIV positive (Treatment as Prevention, TasP) have been shown to have high efficacy and effectiveness in reducing HIV transmission, but there remains a giant gap between what research knows and what services needed to reduce population level incidence of HIV. The major premise of this application is that the effective biomedical to reduce HIV incidence and disparities are in hand, but success will only be achieved when they are implemented in ways that meet individual, community, and health care delivery system needs. This methods proposal addresses this major gap between research and practice through implementation science and methodology, focusing on innovative ways to address the complex, mulitilevel interactions needed to implement HIV prevention programs effectively. Two Cores, an Administrative Core and an Innovative Implementation Methods Core for HIV and Drug Abuse will carry out this work.  Aim 1 is to develop innovative methods to maximize the impact of implementation research in HIV prevention. We do this through an extended set of systems science and engineering methods that focus on improving the measurement of implementation, the modeling of implementation strategies, and the testing of implementation strategies through rigorous trials. Five qualifying grants support this work.  Aim 2 is to apply these innovative methods to close the gap between existing research, policy, and practice for HIV prevention. In addition to working closely with our five qualifying grants, we work locally with municipal Departments of Public Health and the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) HIV programs to identify and prioritize gaps in knowledge, find optimal implementation strategies for reduction of HIV transmission, and design the next large implementation trials.  Aim 3 is to disseminate methods and train/mentor leaders at the intersection of HIV prevention, implementation science, and drug abuse fields to improve implementation of HIV prevention programs. This involves mentoring the early career researchers, publishing, and providing training to networks of HIV and drug abuse researchers. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are numerous rigorously evaluated prevention programs involving biomedical interventions for preventing HIV that have demonstrated impact in efficacy and effectiveness trials. Pre-exposure prophylaxis, HIV testing, and early and consistent antiretroviral treatment have high potential for preventing HIV infections, but these are yet to be implemented sufficiently in racial/ethnic minority communities. This Ce-PIM addresses the critical methods gaps that are holding back the movement of these programs from research to practice.",Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for Drug Abuse and HIV

"Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The Western States (WS) Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) promotes evidence-based drug abuse prevention and treatment services through continued participation in the CTN. The Node 1) designs and implements clinical trials of evidence-based treatments of addiction through rapid recruitment of diverse study participants in partnership with NIDA and the CTN, 2) generates peer-reviewed publications in collaboration with treatment providers and other nodes, and 3) uses the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Regional Research and Training Center includes talented faculty and staff from Oregon Health & Science Center and University of California, San Francisco as well as leaders of affiliated healthcare partners providing integrated primary care and substance use disorder treatment. The Node was created in 2010 as an amalgam of two CTN Nodes--California-Arizona and Oregon/Hawaii (a charter member of the CTN). The Node was highly successful, during the current award, participating in 10 CTN trials, co-leading two of these and leading one; reporting results of CTN main studies, ancillary, and research using the CTN platform in 100+ publications, and actively disseminating evidence- based practices in 200 presentations. Node investigators also sought and received awards for 10 studies that used the CTN as a platform for research. Eight WS Node healthcare programs recruited over 1,300 participants into CTN studies. In the coming grant period the Node expands to include three national and regional primary care and HIV primary care research networks: OCHIN, the HIV Research Network, and the Oregon Rural Practice-Based Research Network (ORPRN). The Node retains core addiction treatment centers experienced in CTN protocols and exploits their links with primary care: Adapt (Roseburg, OR), CODA (Portland, OR) HealthRIGHT 360 (San Francisco, CA), La Frontera (Tucson, AZ), NARA (Portland, OR), and Signal Behavioral Health Network (Denver, CO). The Node's research agenda proposes study concepts that evaluate three strategies to integrate and enhance addiction treatment within healthcare settings. Study 1 builds a patient registry for HCV infection and tests a multi-contact brief intervention for alcohol use. Study 2 extends the registry testing a candidate therapeutic HIV vaccine. Study 3, a test of reverse integration (primary care clinicians in addiction treatment settings), assesses naloxone distribution and education to reduce fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses and measures impact on return to use. Finally the WS Node continues to use the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Node has the potential to accelerate the advancement of integrated primary care and addiction in the coming years. PROJECT NARRATIVE This renewal application to conduct research in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network has broad public health implications focused on developing and testing ways to better treat medical problems and addiction through integrated care. The project will conduct clinical trials of treatments for drug use disorders in the context of primary care addressing hepatitis C, HIV, and opioid overdose--topics of urgent national importance. This research can accelerate the advancement of providing integrated treatments for medical problems and addiction in the coming years.",Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment

"Ending HIV/AIDS among People Who Use Drugs: Overcoming Challenges This is a proposal to renew funding of the Center for Drug Use and HIV Research (CDUHR) for years 21- 25. Recent advances in HIV biomedical and behavioral science have been shown to reduce HIV incidence and allow HIV-positive persons to reach near-normal lifespans. These achievements have led UNAIDS, the US and several local governments to propose strategies for “Ending the HIV Epidemic”. Notwithstanding these successes, attaining this goal among people who use drugs (PWUD) will require addressing a number of important existing barriers. The overall theme of this renewal is “Ending HIV/AIDS among People who use Drugs: Overcoming Challenges”. We define Ending HIV/AIDS as reducing new infections and increasing the proportion of PWUD who are virally suppressed. To accomplish this, we have identified these research priorities, which directly address the most significant challenges: (1) Devise new strategies to overcome emerging and persistent barriers to ending HIV/AIDS among PWUD. Barriers include recent increases in prescription opioid misuse, which have given rise to a new generation of heroin user and injectors, and lack of attention to the key role of substance use in new infections in men who have sex with men and heterosexuals. HIV-positive PWUD also experience disparities all along the continuum of HIV care, including delayed diagnosis, lower retention in care, delayed initiation of ART and poorer disease outcomes. (2) Conduct research on effective ways to broadly implement evidence-based interventions. HIV prevention and care programs for PWUD do not exist in many regions of the US and the rest of the world where they are needed most, and they are rarely implemented at public-health scale. (3) Develop new, innovative models of prevention and treatment interventions to address substance-use related disparities in HIV infection and treatment outcomes that take into account the complex, multilevel nature of HIV among PWUD.  We have made significant changes in our scope and structure for this renewal, and we will achieve our aims through five Cores, an Administrative Core and four Research Support Cores: (1) Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Theory, (2) Transdisciplinary Research Methods, (3) Dissemination and Implementation, and (4) Pilot Projects and Mentoring. These Cores support our research base and affiliated investigators to conduct cutting-edge science and enhance synergy across investigators from multiple disciplines, thereby leading to contributions to the field that are beyond what the individual projects could have achieved. In addition to the many successful initiatives that have been developed over CDUHR's history, new activities were added to respond to the evolving needs of our investigators. Also, in addition to our ongoing commitment to train new investigators to conduct high-impact research, we will collaborate with investigators in areas where HIV epidemics are occurring among PWUD (in rural and middle America, and in eastern Europe and Asia), building on our collective knowledge and expertise to advance toward Ending HIV/AIDS in those regions. Project Narrative A critical time has been reached in the course of the HIV epidemic, when the possibility to end HIVAIDS has been raised. Despite advances in biomedical treatments and behavioral interventions to reduce HIV incidence and its impact, people who use drugs (PWUD) have poorer outcomes. The Center provides a research infrastructure to enhance the productivity, synergy and impact of the research by affiliated investigators working to End HIV/AIDS among PWUD.",Ending HIV/AIDS among People Who Use Drugs: Overcoming Challenges,9893141,P30DA011041,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Americas ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Communities ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Heroin ', ' Diagnosis ', ' diagnosis service ', ' Diagnostic Services ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Epidemic ', ' Eastern Europe ', ' Evolution ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Eastern Asia ', ' East Asia ', ' Far East ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Greece ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Indiana ', ' Infection ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Local Government ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' New York ', ' Perception ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Play ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Time ', ' P30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' ranpirnase ', ' Generations ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Funding ', ' Drug user ', ' persons who use drugs ', ' people who use illicit drugs ', ' people who use drugs ', ' PWUD ', ' Nature ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Distant ', ' Route ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' Viral ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' persons who inject drugs ', ' people who inject illicit drugs ', ' people who inject drugs ', ' PWID ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' Heroin Users ', ' austin ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' prevention service ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Infectious Disease Epidemiology ', ' Infectious Epidemiology ', ' International ', ' Interruption ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' public health research ', ' recruit ', ' treatment services ', ' Injections ', ' heroin use ', ' heroin intake ', ' prescription opioid misuse ', ' prescription opiate misuse ', ' opioid prescription medication misuse ', ' opioid medication misuse ', ' opioid analgesic misuse ', ' nonmedical use of prescription opioids ', ' nonmedical use of prescription opiates ', ' non-medical use of prescription opioids ', ' non-medical use of prescription opiates ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,P30,2019,237750,0.059589963761982494
"Evaluating the Effectiveness of an eHealth EBI for Latino Youth in Primary Care Hispanic adolescents in the U.S. experience significant health disparities, particularly as it relates to drug use, unsafe sexual behaviors and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In spite of these disparities, a paucity of effective preventive interventions exist for Hispanic adolescents, and even fewer have been disseminated widely (IOM/NRC, 2009). Given that primary care settings are increasingly becoming the entry-point through which parents bring youth with behavioral health concerns, adolescent primary care settings represent ideal, yet underutilized, settings in which to disseminate evidence-based preventive interventions. Preventive interventions which target risk and protective factors within the family, the most proximal and fundamental social system influencing human behavior, have been found to be among the most efficacious interventions in preventing and reducing drug use and sexual risk behaviors.  Familias Unidas is a Hispanic-specific, family-based intervention found to be efficacious and effective in preventing and reducing drug use, sexual risk behaviors, and self-reported STIs. Familias Unidas has been cited by the Institute of Medicine report on Preventing, Emotional, and Behavioral among Young People as ready for broad dissemination (IOM/NRC, 2009). To date, however, Familias Unidas has been only tested for efficacy and effectiveness in schools and has not been evaluated for efficacy/effectiveness in primary care. We have adapted and evaluated Familias Unidas for online delivery; successfully retaining 80% of Hispanic parents and their youth (recruited from schools) in the online, eHealth adaptation of Familias Unidas. We have also demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of delivering eHealth Familas Unidas in primary care.  Evaluating innovative eHealth family-based interventions for Hispanic youth whose feasibility and acceptability is established in primary care settings is timely and of high public health significance. Therefore, the proposed study's overarching aim is to evaluate the relative effectiveness and cost effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas, compared to a referral to the National Institute Drug Abuse’s (NIDA) online information page for parents of Hispanic youth (referred hereafter as NIDA Online Information). To test the effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care in preventing drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and STIs in a universal sample of Hispanic youth, this study will randomize 456 Hispanic youth and their parents to eHealth Familias Unidas or to NIDA Online Information. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months post baseline. Study hypotheses are that: 1) eHealth Familias Unidas will be effective, relative to NIDA Online Information, in preventing/reducing drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and STI incidence in Hispanic adolescents over time and 2) Intervention effects will be partially mediated by family functioning for drug use and unprotected sexual behavior and by family functioning and unprotected sexual behavior for STI incidence. The cost effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas over a three year follow up will also be estimated. The proposed study will evaluate the effectiveness of an eHealth adaptation of an evidence-based face-to- face preventive intervention for Hispanic youth, in preventing drug use, sexual risk behaviors, and sexually transmitted diseases in primary care settings. The knowledge expected to be gained in this study will have strong implications for the delivery of prevention interventions in primary care, as well as contribute to the reduction of drug and sexual risk behavior related to disparities seen in Hispanic youth.",Evaluating the Effectiveness of an eHealth EBI for Latino Youth in Primary Care,9820025,R01DA040756,"['Behavior ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Family ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Parents ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Knowledge ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' prevent drug use ', ' prevent drug addiction ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' eHealth ', ' e-Health ', ' relative effectiveness ', ' relative cost ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk behavior ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,98895,0.07929300962446643
"2/2 Drug Development and Capacity Building: A UCR/CoH-CCC Partnership ABSTRACT Cancer drugs in the United States are almost exclusively developed by, tested in, and optimized for European- Americans. Disparities in U.S. drug development are the result of long-standing inequalities that occur throughout the entire drug discovery pipeline. Only a small number of basic, translational and clinical scientists are Latino/Hispanic or Black/African-American. Less than 2-5% of trial participants are Latino/Hispanic or Black/African-American. Yet, in spite of a lack of data, new drugs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and subsequently prescribed for Latino/Hispanic or Black/African-American patients, without sufficient testing. It is unacceptable, especially in this era of the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), that currently our drugs are developed by, and optimized for, only for an exclusive segment of our citizens. We seek to shift this paradigm by strengthening the existing partnership between University of California at Riverside (UCR) and City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center (CoH-CCC). In this proposed P20, UCR and CoH-CCC will partner to develop the resources, infrastructure, and training programs necessary to develop the next generation of therapeutics researchers that reflect the ethnic diversity of Inland Southern California. We anticipate that our P20 program will drive new collaborative R01 grants and K01 and T-type training grants. .

"Mentoring researchers on drug abuse and HIV DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug users with and at-risk for HIV continue to have poor access to health care and poor treatment outcomes. In addition, opioid addiction involving prescription opioids has skyrocketed. In this proposal for a mid-career investigator award, Dr. Chinazo Cunningham proposes to address the opioid epidemic and its intersection with HIV infection by: 1) becoming an internationally recognized leader in the field of drug abuse and HIV, expanding her research to include advanced research methods (comparative effectiveness research [CER] methods and complex clinical trials methods); 2) developing a standardized and structured mentorship approach to mentor junior investigators to conduct patient-oriented research related to drug abuse and/or HIV infection; and 3) becoming an effective leader in academic medicine, ensuring that the institutional infrastructure facilitates junior investigators obtaining skills necessary to become independent investigators. To achieve these goals, Dr. Cunningham will participate in courses and national conferences, have directed readings, and regularly meet with national leaders in related fields. Dr. Cunningham will particularly focus on mentoring women and racial/ethnic minorities-two groups who are under-represented in senior positions in academic medicine and NIH-funded research. Dr. Cunningham will utilize her existing research program as a foundation for which she will provide mentoring and expand her research skills to include CER and complex clinical trials methods. The aims of her research are to: 1) test the efficacy of a 16-week abstinence-reinforcing contingency management intervention on HIV viral load suppression among opioid-dependent HIV-infected individuals, using a randomized controlled trial design; and 2) examine mechanisms of achieving viral load suppression with the abstinence-reinforcing contingency management intervention. Dr. Cunningham's future research will include the establishment of a comprehensive ""live"" database of all opioid users within a large urban medical center. This database will be used to examine health outcomes associated with types of opioid use and to develop and test interventions focused on opioid use. Dr. Cunningham's long-term career objective is to improve access to care and health outcomes among drug-abusing populations with or at-risk for HIV infection by developing interventions that can reduce their disparities in health care and health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application for a K24 mid-career investigator award seeks to provide support to Dr. Chinazo Cunningham to provide excellent mentorship, effective leadership, and expand her current research to include advanced research methods (comparative effectiveness research methods and complex clinical trials methods). Dr. Cunningham will mentor junior investigators in the areas of drug abuse and HIV, with an emphasis on providing mentorship to racial/ethnic minorities and women. Dr. Cunningham will use her existing research project as a foundation to provide much of her mentorship. In addition, expanding her research to include comparative effectiveness research and complex clinical trials focused on opioid use will allow her to conduct new research and provide additional mentorship that can ultimately improve health outcomes of drug users with and at-risk for HIV.",Mentoring researchers on drug abuse and HIV,9449410,K24DA036955,"['Award ', ' Behavior ', '

"Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for Drug Abuse and HIV (Ce-PIM) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application is for a competing renewal of the Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for HIV and Drug Abuse, a NIDA P30 Center of Excellence. The number of new HIV cases in the US remains stable at 56,000 per year and continues to disproportionately affect some groups, including young men who have sex with men (YMSM), especially from racial/ethnic minorities. The purpose of this methodology center is to develop new methodologies that can be used by federal and local agencies and communities to reduce HIV incidence. Biomedical interventions and strategies, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), rapid testing for HIV and early and consistent treatment for persons who are HIV positive (Treatment as Prevention, TasP) have been shown to have high efficacy and effectiveness in reducing HIV transmission, but there remains a giant gap between what research knows and what services needed to reduce population level incidence of HIV. The major premise of this application is that the effective biomedical to reduce HIV incidence and disparities are in hand, but success will only be achieved when they are implemented in ways that meet individual, community, and health care delivery system needs. This methods proposal addresses this major gap between research and practice through implementation science and methodology, focusing on innovative ways to address the complex, mulitilevel interactions needed to implement HIV prevention programs effectively. Two Cores, an Administrative Core and an Innovative Implementation Methods Core for HIV and Drug Abuse will carry out this work.  Aim 1 is to develop innovative methods to maximize the impact of implementation research in HIV prevention. We do this through an extended set of systems science and engineering methods that focus on improving the measurement of implementation, the modeling of implementation strategies, and the testing of implementation strategies through rigorous trials. Five qualifying grants support this work.  Aim 2 is to apply these innovative methods to close the gap between existing research, policy, and practice for HIV prevention. In addition to working closely with our five qualifying grants, we work locally with municipal Departments of Public Health and the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) HIV programs to identify and prioritize gaps in knowledge, find optimal implementation strategies for reduction of HIV transmission, and design the next large implementation trials.  Aim 3 is to disseminate methods and train/mentor leaders at the intersection of HIV prevention, implementation science, and drug abuse fields to improve implementation of HIV prevention programs. This involves mentoring the early career researchers, publishing, and providing training to networks of HIV and drug abuse researchers. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are numerous rigorously evaluated prevention programs involving biomedical interventions for preventing HIV that have demonstrated impact in efficacy and effectiveness trials. Pre-exposure prophylaxis, HIV testing, and early and consistent antiretroviral treatment have high potential for preventing HIV infections, but these are yet to be implemented sufficiently in racial/ethnic minority communities. This Ce-PIM addresses the critical methods gaps that are holding back the movement of these programs from research to practice.",Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for Drug Abuse and HIV

"Health Consequences of Drug Use and IPV Trajectories for Young Latinas ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Few empirical studies have documented the life trajectories of gang-affiliated adolescent females and the long- term health consequences of adolescent drug use and partner violence victimization. The purpose of this study is to identify and determine how distinct drug use and intimate partner violence victimization trajectories that emerge in adolescence through young adulthood contribute to physical and mental health outcomes among Mexican American women within the context of a highly disadvantaged community. This group of women are particularly vulnerable given they have low rates of access and utilization of health care, are the most likely age group to be uninsured, and represent a nexus of risk, vulnerability and potentially high costs to communities given their reproductive and sexual health stage of life. This application proposes a 15 year follow up of a cohort of Mexican American adolescent females previously identified in a CDC funded study who were affiliated with male gang members during their adolescence and involved in high rates of drug use and victims of intimate partner violence. Building upon the research teams previous studies and using analytical tools from the theory of gender and power and social bonding theory, this application will implement a concurrent mixed methods nested design approach to provide a comprehensive understanding of the long-term consequences of drug use and IPV. The sample will consist of 300 young adult Mexican-American females. The specific aims for this study are: 1) determine the prevalence of physical (cardiovascular and metabolic risk markers and STI infection) and mental (depression, PTSD, anxiety/stress) health outcomes; 2) identify and characterize distinct drug use and IPV trajectories from adolescence through young adulthood; 3) determine whether sexual relationship power and family social bonds during distinct age-graded stages alter drug use and IPV trajectories and health outcomes; and 4) characterize qualitatively the culture and community context and their influence on drug use and IPV trajectories over the life course. This research will have an important positive impact by identifying women who are at the highest risk for developing harmful drug and IPV trajectories as they transition into young adulthood. In doing this, we will lay the foundation for identifying critical points of behavioral intervention during key age-graded periods as well as culturally and contextually appropriate values and strategies that will reduce health disparities among similar high-risk female populations that have gone underrepresented in existing research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This application seek a comprehensive understanding of the long term health consequences of drug use and intimate partner violence victimization physical and mental health outcomes among a vulnerable cohort of Mexican-American females recruited over 15 years ago who were affiliated with male gang members during their adolescence. The study will provide a unique opportunity to investigate detrimental life trajectories contributing t the prevalence of cardiovascular and metabolic risk markers, infection, depression, PTSD, anxiety and stress within a marginalized and underserved community context. Findings will contribute to policy discourse that can lead to the development of innovative public health programs and campaigns that will reduce health disparities among minority women.

"Evaluating the Effectiveness of an eHealth EBI for Latino Youth in Primary Care Hispanic adolescents in the U.S. experience significant health disparities, particularly as it relates to drug use, unsafe sexual behaviors and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In spite of these disparities, a paucity of effective preventive interventions exist for Hispanic adolescents, and even fewer have been disseminated widely (IOM/NRC, 2009). Given that primary care settings are increasingly becoming the entry-point through which parents bring youth with behavioral health concerns, adolescent primary care settings represent ideal, yet underutilized, settings in which to disseminate evidence-based preventive interventions. Preventive interventions which target risk and protective factors within the family, the most proximal and fundamental social system influencing human behavior, have been found to be among the most efficacious interventions in preventing and reducing drug use and sexual risk behaviors.  Familias Unidas is a Hispanic-specific, family-based intervention found to be efficacious and effective in preventing and reducing drug use, sexual risk behaviors, and self-reported STIs. Familias Unidas has been cited by the Institute of Medicine report on Preventing, Emotional, and Behavioral among Young People as ready for broad dissemination (IOM/NRC, 2009). To date, however, Familias Unidas has been only tested for efficacy and effectiveness in schools and has not been evaluated for efficacy/effectiveness in primary care. We have adapted and evaluated Familias Unidas for online delivery; successfully retaining 80% of Hispanic parents and their youth (recruited from schools) in the online, eHealth adaptation of Familias Unidas. We have also demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of delivering eHealth Familas Unidas in primary care.  Evaluating innovative eHealth family-based interventions for Hispanic youth whose feasibility and acceptability is established in primary care settings is timely and of high public health significance. Therefore, the proposed study's overarching aim is to evaluate the relative effectiveness and cost effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas, compared to a referral to the National Institute Drug Abuse’s (NIDA) online information page for parents of Hispanic youth (referred hereafter as NIDA Online Information). To test the effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care in preventing drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and STIs in a universal sample of Hispanic youth, this study will randomize 456 Hispanic youth and their parents to eHealth Familias Unidas or to NIDA Online Information. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months post baseline. Study hypotheses are that: 1) eHealth Familias Unidas will be effective, relative to NIDA Online Information, in preventing/reducing drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and STI incidence in Hispanic adolescents over time and 2) Intervention effects will be partially mediated by family functioning for drug use and unprotected sexual behavior and by family functioning and unprotected sexual behavior for STI incidence. The cost effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas over a three year follow up will also be estimated. The proposed study will evaluate the effectiveness of an eHealth adaptation of an evidence-based face-to- face preventive intervention for Hispanic youth, in preventing drug use, sexual risk behaviors, and sexually transmitted diseases in primary care settings. The knowledge expected to be gained in this study will have strong implications for the delivery of prevention interventions in primary care, as well as contribute to the reduction of drug and sexual risk behavior related to disparities seen in Hispanic youth.",Evaluating the Effectiveness of an eHealth EBI for Latino Youth in Primary Care,9694685,R01DA040756,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Family ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Leadership ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Parents ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Staff Attitudes ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Emotional disorder ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' unprotected intercourse ', ' condomless sex ', ' condomless intercourse ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' junior high school ', ' middle school ', ' junior high ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' prevent drug use ', ' prevent drug addiction ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' eHealth ', ' e-Health ', ' parent-adolescent communication ', ' relative effectiveness ', ' relative cost ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk behavior ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,659035,0.07929300962446643
"Drug use disparities among Hispanics: elucidating the complex interactions between socio-cultural, neurocognitive and drug use-related factors Project Summary/Abstract: Hispanic adolescents are disproportionately affected by drug use and its consequences. This is reflected in high rates of school dropouts, arrest for drug possession, alcohol, drug use disorders, disability and drug related crash injuries and fatalities. Mounting evidence suggest that impaired neurocognitive functioning, exposure to early, severe, or chronic social disadvantage, and stress related to conflicting cultural practices, independently predict adverse drug use outcomes. Yet, studies employing an integrated approach to explore how these factors interact to increase or decrease the risk of experiencing adverse drug use consequences are limited. Therefore, the immediate and overarching goal of this K01 application is to receive intensive, supervised career-development training on the intersection between addiction neuroscience and social and cross-cultural research applied to drug use research that will enable me to pursue a line of independent research on drug use disparities. In this application, I propose to investigate how socio- cultural, neurocognitive and drug use related factors interact to explain the adverse outcomes seen in the Hispanic population. The specific aims of the proposed project include: 1) To determine whether neurocognitive factors (e.g., decision-making, episodic memory), mediate the associations between socio-cultural factors (e.g., early, severe, or chronic socio-economic disadvantage, ethnic discrimination, acculturative stress, Hispanic cultural values), and drug use outcomes (e.g. transition from use to drug use disorders, drug use trajectories, driving under the influence of drugs - DIU); 2) To examine whether socio-cultural factors moderate the associations between neurocognitive factors and drug use. These goals will be achieved by leveraging data, participants, and resources from an ongoing longitudinal study (parent study) that assesses decision-making and episodic memory in trajectories to cannabis addiction (R01DA031176), and interviewing a sub-sample of young Hispanics participating in the parent study and their parents or legal guardians (n=200 dyads). The proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will build on my expertise in drug use epidemiology with advanced training in: addiction neuroscience, social and cross-cultural research on drug use disparities, interdisciplinary research on cognitive neuroscience and socio-cultural research, advanced statistical methods for analyzing longitudinal data, and responsible conduct of research. Overseeing this training is my primary mentor Dr. Raul Gonzalez, an expert in addiction neuroscience, and my co-mentor Dr. Mario De La Rosa, an expert in cross-cultural research and drug use disparities. The proposed K01, which is responsive to two of the two priority focus areas identified in the 2016-2020 NIDA Strategic Plan, will provide me with the resources, training, mentoring and knowledge needed to establish myself as a scientist with expertise on the intersection between addiction neuroscience and public health, and to develop a long-term independent transdisciplinary research program aimed at reducing and eliminating drug use disparities across and within minority populations. Project narrative: Socio-cultural and neurocognitive factors are important and potentially modifiable determinants of drug use, yet research examining the how these factors interact to explain drug use disparities is scarce. The proposed K01 training will support a Hispanic new and early stage investigator to become an independent researcher and a leader in interdisciplinary research on drug use disparities. Specifically, the outlined project will contribute to understand how social factors, Hispanic cultural values, neurocognitive processes and drug use related factors interact to explain the adverse drug use outcomes seen in the growing and heterogeneous Hispanic population, which is essential to design effective drug use preventive interventions.","Drug use disparities among Hispanics: elucidating the complex interactions between socio-cultural, neurocognitive and drug use-related factors",9764333,K01DA046715,"['Affect ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Legal Guardians ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' School Dropouts ', ' Student Dropouts ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Injury ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Exposure to ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' psychosocial ', ' Episodic memory ', ' experience ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Applied Research ', ' Applied Science ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' cultural values ', ' social ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' multi-level model ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' driving under influence ', ' ethnic discrimination ', ' theories ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cannabis ', ' prevent drug use ', ' prevent drug addiction ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' drug use prevention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' early onset ', ' early onset drug use ', ' early initiation drug use ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Cognitive remediation ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' cognitive development ', ' marijuana use ', ' cannabis use ', ' THC use ', ' THC co-use ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2019,161387,0.22159522634227913
"Pilot Study of a Community-Pharmacy Model to Expand Access to Medications to Treat and Prevent Hepatitis C, Opioid Use Disorders, Overdose and HIV Among Persons Who Inject Drugs ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY The opioid epidemic is a major public health crisis in the United States, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality related to the consequences of opioid use disorders and injection drug use, namely hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV, and overdose. Yet, we are at a unique historical moment, as we possess effective medications that can improve and sustain the lives of people who inject drugs (PWID). Currently there are medications that can be prescribed to 1) cure HCV (directly-acting antivirals or DAAs), 2) prevent HIV infection (Pre-exposure Prophylaxis [PrEP]), and 3) treat/prevent overdose (naloxone and medications to treat OUD). Furthermore, there is an unprecedented opportunity to eliminate HCV, a disease that is transmitted through injecting drugs. However, achieving the goals of elimination will require better systems for allowing PWID access to medications to cure hepatitis C, as well as medications to prevent overdose and HIV. Pharmacists and community-pharmacy programs may be an innovative solution for this problem. Collaborative Drug Therapy Agreements (CDTAs) allow pharmacists to have authority to autonomously perform testing and prescribing and dispensing medications. We propose to use this R34 mechanism to develop and pilot test a novel health service delivery model, namely a community-pharmacy program for providing DAAs and medications to prevent overdose and HIV among PWID with HCV. For Aim #1, we will conduct qualitative interviews with PWID with HCV and other key community stakeholders in order to inform the development of a community- pharmacy program to expand access to medications to treat HCV and prevent overdose and HIV. For Aim #2, we will pilot and evaluate the community-pharmacy program at a local pharmacy in Seattle. This application is submitted under the funding announcement PA-18-774 (“Pilot Health Services and Economic Research on the Treatment of Drug, Alcohol, and Tobacco Abuse”), which includes pilot testing of health service interventions that optimize access utilization of drug use disorder related services, as well as services for comorbid medical conditions. The proposed research leverages a number of existing community partnerships with local stakeholders and would lead to a future multi-site effectiveness study that would utilize existing community- based pharmacies in order to work toward improving drug users' health by expanding access to life-saving medications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Persons who inject drugs (PWID) face barriers to accessing efficacious and potentially life-saving medications. The purpose of the research is to develop and pilot a community-pharmacy based model of care for PWID that can offer treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV), in addition to medications to prevent overdose and HIV. The proposed research would lead to a future multi-site effectiveness study that will utilize existing community- based pharmacies to expand access to relevant medications for PWID, in order to reduce health disparities in this group and reach the World Health Organization's goal to eliminate HCV by 2030.","Pilot Study of a Community-Pharmacy Model to Expand Access to Medications to Treat and Prevent Hepatitis C, Opioid Use Disorders, Overdose and HIV Among Persons Who Inject Drugs",9822934,R34DA047660,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' anti-virals ', ' anti-viral drugs ', ' anti-viral agents ', ' Antivirals ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Awareness ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Communities ', ' Community Pharmacy ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Heroin ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' Drug Utilization ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' hep C ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Indiana ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  The Western States (WS) Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) promotes evidence-based drug abuse prevention and treatment services through continued participation in the CTN. The Node 1) designs and implements clinical trials of evidence-based treatments of addiction through rapid recruitment of diverse study participants in partnership with NIDA and the CTN, 2) generates peer-reviewed publications in collaboration with treatment providers and other nodes, and 3) uses the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Regional Research and Training Center includes talented faculty and staff from Oregon Health & Science Center and University of California, San Francisco as well as leaders of affiliated healthcare partners providing integrated primary care and substance use disorder treatment. The Node was created in 2010 as an amalgam of two CTN Nodes--California-Arizona and Oregon/Hawaii (a charter member of the CTN). The Node was highly successful, during the current award, participating in 10 CTN trials, co-leading two of these and leading one; reporting results of CTN main studies, ancillary, and research using the CTN platform in 100+ publications, and actively disseminating evidence- based practices in 200 presentations. Node investigators also sought and received awards for 10 studies that used the CTN as a platform for research. Eight WS Node healthcare programs recruited over 1,300 participants into CTN studies. In the coming grant period the Node expands to include three national and regional primary care and HIV primary care research networks: OCHIN, the HIV Research Network, and the Oregon Rural Practice-Based Research Network (ORPRN). The Node retains core addiction treatment centers experienced in CTN protocols and exploits their links with primary care: Adapt (Roseburg, OR), CODA (Portland, OR) HealthRIGHT 360 (San Francisco, CA), La Frontera (Tucson, AZ), NARA (Portland, OR), and Signal Behavioral Health Network (Denver, CO). The Node's research agenda proposes study concepts that evaluate three strategies to integrate and enhance addiction treatment within healthcare settings. Study 1 builds a patient registry for HCV infection and tests a multi-contact brief intervention for alcohol use. Study 2 extends the registry testing a candidate therapeutic HIV vaccine. Study 3, a test of reverse integration (primary care clinicians in addiction treatment settings), assesses naloxone distribution and education to reduce fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses and measures impact on return to use. Finally the WS Node continues to use the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Node has the potential to accelerate the advancement of integrated primary care and addiction in the coming years. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This renewal application to conduct research in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network has broad public health implications focused on developing and testing ways to better treat medical problems and addiction through integrated care. The project will conduct clinical trials of treatments for drug use disorders in the context of primary care addressing hepatitis C, HIV, and opioid overdose--topics of urgent national importance. This research can accelerate the advancement of providing integrated treatments for medical problems and addiction in the coming years.",Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment

"Optimizing Immunosuppression Drug Dosing via Phenotypic Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY The authors have developed a computational platform to rapidly identify optimal drug and dose combinations from the innumerable possibilities. By testing this technique termed Phenotypic Personalized Medicine (PPM) in a diverse number of experimental systems representing different diseases, they have found that the response of biological systems to drugs can be described by a low order, smooth multidimensional surface. The main consequence of this is that optimal drug combinations can be found in a small number of tests. This input–output relationship is always based on experimental data, not modeling, and it would lead to a straightforward solution for handling human diversity in drug dosing needs, among other clinical problems. They will test the hypothesis that PPM can be developed and validated for clinical use by conducting a prospective clinical trial to compare the feasibility and efficacy of this approach to standard of care physician dosing. This group has previously used PPM-based optimization to find novel drug combinations in in vitro and in vivo models of cancer and infection. In a first-in-human study, they recently compared 4 PPM-dosed patients and 4 control (standard of care dosed) patients. They calculated the tacrolimus dosing regimen using the PPM process and showed significant improvement in variability and a trend toward improved efficacy. For this application, they aim to show in a clinical trial, that PPM is more effective than unaided physician dosing. This will allow the generation of data to justify a multi-center confirmatory study and to explore a wider array of clinical outcomes to optimize. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project uses a computational drug-dose optimization platform (Phenotypic Precision Medicine) to an important problem in transplant immunosuppression, the maintenance of patient tacrolimus blood levels within a clinically desired target range.

"Structural switching of the bifunctional Chlamydia trachomatis protein, Scc4 PROJECT SUMMARY The role of the bi-functional Chlamydia trachomatis protein, Scc4 (formerly Ct663), in regulating the type III secretion system (T3SS) and the essential, developmental cycle (between infectious elementary bod- ies and actively dividing, reticulate bodies) is not well-understood at the molecular level. Scc4 is a unique protein that functions (i) as a T3SS chaperone with Scc1 to regulate secretion of CopN (an essential viru- lence factor) and (ii) as a transcription factor regulating 66-RNA polymerase holoenzyme. Based on pro- gress made during the last funding period, the switching mechanism proposed for Scc4’s dual functions involves a conformational change in its 3-dimensional structure. Because Scc4 has two essential func- tions and is unique to C. trachomatis, it is a novel target for developing anti-virulence drugs. In order to develop drugs targeting the T3SS and developmental cycle of C. trachomatis, the structural mechanisms controlling Scc4’s chaperone function and its interaction with its protein partners must first be deter- mined. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to screen and design drugs targeting Scc4’s func- tions, which would prevent the bacteria from spreading, likely curing C. trachomatis directly and certainly mitigating the development of antibiotic-resistant strains, when combined with current therapies. The overall objectives of this application are to understand the switching mechanism of Scc4 between its free and chaperone-complex forms. The central hypothesis is that a conformational switch in Scc4’s structure regulates its dual activity. The rationale for the proposed research is that inhibitors to disrupt Scc4’s chaperone functions can be designed, resulting in new approaches to treat C. trachomatis and new mo- lecular tools to study the T3SS and developmental cycle. The central hypothesis and objectives of this application will be tested and attained by pursuing two specific aims: determine the high-resolution 3D structure of (1) Scc4 and (2) Scc4 in complex with Scc1. It is anticipated that these aims will yield the ex- pected outcome of a structural model of Scc4’s switching mechanism for rational drug design. This out- come is expected to have an important positive impact because structures of Scc4 will provide the infor- mation necessary to develop drugs targeting Scc4’s conformational switch and/or binding interface with Scc1 fundamentally advancing the fields of structural biology and infectious disease biology. This contri- bution is significant because it is the first step in a continuum of research that is expected to lead to un- derstanding Scc4’s dual functions at the atomic level and contribute to the treatment of the most com- mon, sexually transmitted bacterial disease. The proposed research is innovative because the NMR structural and biochemical characterization of a unique bi-functional protein from C. trachomatis to target bacterial virulence as a therapeutic strategy represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common, sexually transmitted bacterial disease in the United States and can cause reproductive health complications and pneumonia in infants born to infected women. A novel enzyme of Chlamydia trachomatis, called Scc4, is an attractive drug target because it has two functions that contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease. Developing a structural model of Scc4 and its protein complexes is an essential step toward the rational design of drugs and to provide molecular tools to fundamentally advance the field of microbiology.","Structural switching of the bifunctional Chlamydia trachomatis protein, Scc4",9881133,R15GM109413,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Bacteria ', ' Biology ', ' Cellular Inclusions ', ' Inclusion Bodies ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Rickettsia trachomae ', ' C. trachomatis ', ' C trachomatis ', ' Chlamydia trachomatis ', ' Infectious Disorder ', ' Infectious Diseases ', ' Infectious Disease Pathway ', ' Communicable Diseases ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Drug Design ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Female ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Goals ', ' In Vitro ', ' Infant ', ' Infection ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Microbiology ', ' Structural Models ', ' conformational state ', ' conformation ', ' Molecular Stereochemistry ', ' Molecular Configuration ', ' Molecular Conformation ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Pneumonia ', ' Proteins ', ' Factor II ', ' Differentiation Reversal Factor ', ' Coagulation Factor II ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor II ', ' Prothrombin ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' RNA Polymerases ', ' DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases ', ' DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Bacterial Venereal Diseases ', ' Bacterial Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sigma Subunit ', ' Sigma Initiation Factor ', ' Sigma Element ', ' Sigma Factor ', ' backbone ', ' Spine ', ' Spinal Column ', ' Vertebral column ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' United States ', ' Virulence ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' antibiotic resistant ', ' antibiotic drug resistance ', ' Resistant to antibiotics ', ' Resistance to antibiotics ', ' Antibiotic Resistance ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Biochemical ', ' Link ', ' Pelvic Inflammatory Disease ', ' pelvic inflammatory syndrome ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Molecular Chaperones ', ' Chaperone ', ' Funding ', ' Holoenzymes ', ' Therapeutic ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' cell type ', ' Blindness ', ' visual loss ', ' vision loss ', ' experience ', ' structural biology ', ' transcription factor S-II ', ' transcription factor IIS ', ' transcription elongation factor S-II ', ' transcription elongation factor A ', ' strand transfer protein alpha ', ' elongation factor SII ', ' TFIIS elongation factor ', ' TFIIS ', ' SII transcription elongation factor ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' mate ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Virulence Factors ', ' Pathogenicity Factors ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Ubiquinone-Cytochrome b-c2 Oxidoreductase ', ' Ubiquinol-ferricytochrome-c oxidoreductase ', ' Ubiquinol-Cytochrome-c Reductase ', ' Ubihydroquinone-Cytochrome-c Reductase ', ' QH(2)-Ferricytochrome-c Oxidoreductase ', ' QH(2)-Cytochrome-c Reductase ', ' Dihydroubiquinone-Cytochrome-c Reductase ', ' Cytochrome b-c2 Oxidoreductase ', ' Complex III ', ' Coenzyme QH2-Cytochrome-c Reductase ', ' Coenzyme Q-Cytochrome-c Reductase ', ' Electron Transport Complex III ', ' protein complex ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Global Change ', ' Resolution ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Type III Secretion System Pathway ', ' Type III Secretion System ', ' Molecular ', ' protein function ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' three dimensional structure ', ' 3D structure ', ' 3-dimensional structure ', ' 3-D structure ', ' pathogenic bacteria ', ' bacterial pathogen ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' resistant strain ', ' resistance strain ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' ']",NIGMS,LOUISIANA STATE UNIV A&M COL BATON ROUGE,R15,2019,434606,0.0586362304947264
"Ending HIV/AIDS among People Who Use Drugs: Overcoming Challenges This is a proposal to renew funding of the Center for Drug Use and HIV Research (CDUHR) for years 21- 25. Recent advances in HIV biomedical and behavioral science have been shown to reduce HIV incidence and allow HIV-positive persons to reach near-normal lifespans. These achievements have led UNAIDS, the US and several local governments to propose strategies for “Ending the HIV Epidemic”. Notwithstanding these successes, attaining this goal among people who use drugs (PWUD) will require addressing a number of important existing barriers. The overall theme of this renewal is “Ending HIV/AIDS among People who use Drugs: Overcoming Challenges”. We define Ending HIV/AIDS as reducing new infections and increasing the proportion of PWUD who are virally suppressed. To accomplish this, we have identified these research priorities, which directly address the most significant challenges: (1) Devise new strategies to overcome emerging and persistent barriers to ending HIV/AIDS among PWUD. Barriers include recent increases in prescription opioid misuse, which have given rise to a new generation of heroin user and injectors, and lack of attention to the key role of substance use in new infections in men who have sex with men and heterosexuals. HIV-positive PWUD also experience disparities all along the continuum of HIV care, including delayed diagnosis, lower retention in care, delayed initiation of ART and poorer disease outcomes. (2) Conduct research on effective ways to broadly implement evidence-based interventions. HIV prevention and care programs for PWUD do not exist in many regions of the US and the rest of the world where they are needed most, and they are rarely implemented at public-health scale. (3) Develop new, innovative models of prevention and treatment interventions to address substance-use related disparities in HIV infection and treatment outcomes that take into account the complex, multilevel nature of HIV among PWUD.  We have made significant changes in our scope and structure for this renewal, and we will achieve our aims through five Cores, an Administrative Core and four Research Support Cores: (1) Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Theory, (2) Transdisciplinary Research Methods, (3) Dissemination and Implementation, and (4) Pilot Projects and Mentoring. These Cores support our research base and affiliated investigators to conduct cutting-edge science and enhance synergy across investigators from multiple disciplines, thereby leading to contributions to the field that are beyond what the individual projects could have achieved. In addition to the many successful initiatives that have been developed over CDUHR's history, new activities were added to respond to the evolving needs of our investigators. Also, in addition to our ongoing commitment to train new investigators to conduct high-impact research, we will collaborate with investigators in areas where HIV epidemics are occurring among PWUD (in rural and middle America, and in eastern Europe and Asia), building on our collective knowledge and expertise to advance toward Ending HIV/AIDS in those regions.

"Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  The Western States (WS) Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) promotes evidence-based drug abuse prevention and treatment services through continued participation in the CTN. The Node 1) designs and implements clinical trials of evidence-based treatments of addiction through rapid recruitment of diverse study participants in partnership with NIDA and the CTN, 2) generates peer-reviewed publications in collaboration with treatment providers and other nodes, and 3) uses the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Regional Research and Training Center includes talented faculty and staff from Oregon Health & Science Center and University of California, San Francisco as well as leaders of affiliated healthcare partners providing integrated primary care and substance use disorder treatment. The Node was created in 2010 as an amalgam of two CTN Nodes--California-Arizona and Oregon/Hawaii (a charter member of the CTN). The Node was highly successful, during the current award, participating in 10 CTN trials, co-leading two of these and leading one; reporting results of CTN main studies, ancillary, and research using the CTN platform in 100+ publications, and actively disseminating evidence- based practices in 200 presentations. Node investigators also sought and received awards for 10 studies that used the CTN as a platform for research. Eight WS Node healthcare programs recruited over 1,300 participants into CTN studies. In the coming grant period the Node expands to include three national and regional primary care and HIV primary care research networks: OCHIN, the HIV Research Network, and the Oregon Rural Practice-Based Research Network (ORPRN). The Node retains core addiction treatment centers experienced in CTN protocols and exploits their links with primary care: Adapt (Roseburg, OR), CODA (Portland, OR) HealthRIGHT 360 (San Francisco, CA), La Frontera (Tucson, AZ), NARA (Portland, OR), and Signal Behavioral Health Network (Denver, CO). The Node's research agenda proposes study concepts that evaluate three strategies to integrate and enhance addiction treatment within healthcare settings. Study 1 builds a patient registry for HCV infection and tests a multi-contact brief intervention for alcohol use. Study 2 extends the registry testing a candidate therapeutic HIV vaccine. Study 3, a test of reverse integration (primary care clinicians in addiction treatment settings), assesses naloxone distribution and education to reduce fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses and measures impact on return to use. Finally the WS Node continues to use the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Node has the potential to accelerate the advancement of integrated primary care and addiction in the coming years. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This renewal application to conduct research in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network has broad public health implications focused on developing and testing ways to better treat medical problems and addiction through integrated care. The project will conduct clinical trials of treatments for drug use disorders in the context of primary care addressing hepatitis C, HIV, and opioid overdose--topics of urgent national importance. This research can accelerate the advancement of providing integrated treatments for medical problems and addiction in the coming years.",Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment

"Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for Drug Abuse and HIV (Ce-PIM) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application is for a competing renewal of the Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for HIV and Drug Abuse, a NIDA P30 Center of Excellence. The number of new HIV cases in the US remains stable at 56,000 per year and continues to disproportionately affect some groups, including young men who have sex with men (YMSM), especially from racial/ethnic minorities. The purpose of this methodology center is to develop new methodologies that can be used by federal and local agencies and communities to reduce HIV incidence. Biomedical interventions and strategies, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), rapid testing for HIV and early and consistent treatment for persons who are HIV positive (Treatment as Prevention, TasP) have been shown to have high efficacy and effectiveness in reducing HIV transmission, but there remains a giant gap between what research knows and what services needed to reduce population level incidence of HIV. The major premise of this application is that the effective biomedical to reduce HIV incidence and disparities are in hand, but success will only be achieved when they are implemented in ways that meet individual, community, and health care delivery system needs. This methods proposal addresses this major gap between research and practice through implementation science and methodology, focusing on innovative ways to address the complex, mulitilevel interactions needed to implement HIV prevention programs effectively. Two Cores, an Administrative Core and an Innovative Implementation Methods Core for HIV and Drug Abuse will carry out this work.  Aim 1 is to develop innovative methods to maximize the impact of implementation research in HIV prevention. We do this through an extended set of systems science and engineering methods that focus on improving the measurement of implementation, the modeling of implementation strategies, and the testing of implementation strategies through rigorous trials. Five qualifying grants support this work.  Aim 2 is to apply these innovative methods to close the gap between existing research, policy, and practice for HIV prevention. In addition to working closely with our five qualifying grants, we work locally with municipal Departments of Public Health and the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) HIV programs to identify and prioritize gaps in knowledge, find optimal implementation strategies for reduction of HIV transmission, and design the next large implementation trials.  Aim 3 is to disseminate methods and train/mentor leaders at the intersection of HIV prevention, implementation science, and drug abuse fields to improve implementation of HIV prevention programs. This involves mentoring the early career researchers, publishing, and providing training to networks of HIV and drug abuse researchers. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are numerous rigorously evaluated prevention programs involving biomedical interventions for preventing HIV that have demonstrated impact in efficacy and effectiveness trials. Pre-exposure prophylaxis, HIV testing, and early and consistent antiretroviral treatment have high potential for preventing HIV infections, but these are yet to be implemented sufficiently in racial/ethnic minority communities. This Ce-PIM addresses the critical methods gaps that are holding back the movement of these programs from research to practice.",Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for Drug Abuse and HIV

"Ending HIV/AIDS among People Who Use Drugs: Overcoming Challenges This is a proposal to renew funding of the Center for Drug Use and HIV Research (CDUHR) for years 21- 25. Recent advances in HIV biomedical and behavioral science have been shown to reduce HIV incidence and allow HIV-positive persons to reach near-normal lifespans. These achievements have led UNAIDS, the US and several local governments to propose strategies for “Ending the HIV Epidemic”. Notwithstanding these successes, attaining this goal among people who use drugs (PWUD) will require addressing a number of important existing barriers. The overall theme of this renewal is “Ending HIV/AIDS among People who use Drugs: Overcoming Challenges”. We define Ending HIV/AIDS as reducing new infections and increasing the proportion of PWUD who are virally suppressed. To accomplish this, we have identified these research priorities, which directly address the most significant challenges: (1) Devise new strategies to overcome emerging and persistent barriers to ending HIV/AIDS among PWUD. Barriers include recent increases in prescription opioid misuse, which have given rise to a new generation of heroin user and injectors, and lack of attention to the key role of substance use in new infections in men who have sex with men and heterosexuals. HIV-positive PWUD also experience disparities all along the continuum of HIV care, including delayed diagnosis, lower retention in care, delayed initiation of ART and poorer disease outcomes. (2) Conduct research on effective ways to broadly implement evidence-based interventions. HIV prevention and care programs for PWUD do not exist in many regions of the US and the rest of the world where they are needed most, and they are rarely implemented at public-health scale. (3) Develop new, innovative models of prevention and treatment interventions to address substance-use related disparities in HIV infection and treatment outcomes that take into account the complex, multilevel nature of HIV among PWUD.  We have made significant changes in our scope and structure for this renewal, and we will achieve our aims through five Cores, an Administrative Core and four Research Support Cores: (1) Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Theory, (2) Transdisciplinary Research Methods, (3) Dissemination and Implementation, and (4) Pilot Projects and Mentoring. These Cores support our research base and affiliated investigators to conduct cutting-edge science and enhance synergy across investigators from multiple disciplines, thereby leading to contributions to the field that are beyond what the individual projects could have achieved. In addition to the many successful initiatives that have been developed over CDUHR's history, new activities were added to respond to the evolving needs of our investigators. Also, in addition to our ongoing commitment to train new investigators to conduct high-impact research, we will collaborate with investigators in areas where HIV epidemics are occurring among PWUD (in rural and middle America, and in eastern Europe and Asia), building on our collective knowledge and expertise to advance toward Ending HIV/AIDS in those regions. Project Narrative A critical time has been reached in the course of the HIV epidemic, when the possibility to end HIVAIDS has been raised.

"Developing and Piloting a School Staff-Based Intervention to Reduce Alcohol and Drug Use Among Sexual Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alcohol and drug use (e.g., tobacco and marijuana use) are major public health problems affecting large proportions of youth. Alcohol and drug use also disproportionately burden certain youth populations, such as sexual minority youth (SMY; i.e., adolescents who identify as gay/lesbian or bisexual, or who have same- gender sexual behaviors or attractions). Compared with heterosexual youth, SMY have up to 600% higher odds of lifetime drug and alcohol use. Despite these substantial disparities, few evidence-based interventions exist for reducing alcohol and drug use among SMY. Nevertheless, SMY who report having supportive adults at school, greater school connectedness, and lower bullying victimization have lower drug and alcohol use. Therefore, an intervention that trains school staff (e.g., teachers, principals, nurses, counselors) to better understand SMY, support SMY, and engage in positive bystander behaviors that protect SMY from bullying victimization may reduce sexual-orientation disparities in drug and alcohol use. Furthermore, many school staff desire to support SMY, but they report a lack of training as their primary impediment. To address these gaps, I will execute two Specific Aims. In Aim #1, I will develop an online e-learning intervention aimed at improving school staff’s knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy for supporting SMY. Using the intervention mapping approach, I will develop, user-test, and refine intervention materials by: conducting focus groups with a School Staff Advisory Board; performing usability tests via think aloud interviews with school staff; and collaborating with professional e-learning developers. In Aim #2, I will pilot test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of this school staff-based intervention using a two-armed cluster-randomized controlled trial. I will enroll high schools participating in the fully-funded survey infrastructure of the MetroWest Adolescent Health Survey (MWAHS), located outside Boston, Massachusetts, where sexual-orientation disparities in drug and alcohol use still exist. Biennially, the MWAHS administers surveys to all students in each school, providing ample student-level data. In tandem, I will collect new longitudinal survey data (baseline and 6-month follow-up) from all school staff within each enrolled school. This e-learning intervention is easily modifiable and economically scalable, making it apt for wide dissemination with the potential for population-level impact in reducing drug and alcohol use disparities. To successfully complete my research, I will acquire training in: (1) the development of stakeholder- informed interventions, particularly e-learning programs; (2) implementation science research; and (3) the design and analysis of experimental studies. Guided by a strong interdisciplinary mentorship team, my planned training activities include mentorship meetings, formal coursework, training institutes, scientific seminars, and research conferences. Upon successful completion of my research and training plans, I will be propelled towards achieving my long-term goal, which is to become an independent scientific researcher specializing in stakeholder-informed intervention science aimed at reducing drug and alcohol use disparities for SMY. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Institute of Medicine’s 2011 report titled “The Health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) People” calls for the development of evidence-based interventions for reducing sexual minority youth’s large and persistent disparities in drug and alcohol use. The goals of the proposed research are to develop and pilot test an e-learning intervention that trains school staff to better understand, support, and protect sexual minority youth, and this novel intervention is hypothesized to increase adult support and school connectedness and simultaneously decrease bullying victimization, drug use, and alcohol use among sexual minority youth. Given the dearth of published research on alcohol and drug use interventions for sexual minority youth, this project will provide novel scientific contributions that can help foster health equity for sexual minority youth.",Developing and Piloting a School Staff-Based Intervention to Reduce Alcohol and Drug Use Among Sexual Minority Youth,9720056,K01AA027564,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult

"Real-time prediction of emerging drug use epidemics in the United States Project summary The overdose epidemic in the United States has followed an exponential curve since 1979 with no sign of abating. On the contrary, a series of political, economic and technological factors are fueling drug use epidemics in the country. Technological advances have led to an explosion in the emergence of powerful synthetic substances which can be produced with minimal equipment. Inequalities, poor mental health services and other social issues contribute to an increased susceptibility to drug use disorders. Improved transport and communication infrastructure, including the internet, facilitates the emergence of drug markets. As a result, polysubstance use is diversifying presenting new health risks and new challenges for treatment. In 2017, over 70,000 people died of an overdose and HIV outbreaks were identified in two cities of Massachusetts. Curbing these alarming trends requires preemptive epidemic preparedness and the latter should be based on a rigorous and systematic assessment of the factors influencing drug use epidemics. These factors, however, are dynamic and interacting. We will use an emerging infectious disease framework and dynamic mathematical modeling methods to predict emerging drug use epidemics in the United States. Mathematical modeling has been used extensively to forecast emerging and re- emerging infectious disease epidemics because it allows to mechanistically represent the different factors determining disease transmission and their dynamics over time. We will develop a mathematical model of drug use in the United States which represents current patterns of drug use across the country and associated HIV, HCV and overdose incidence. It will explicitly represent heterogeneity in susceptibility to drug use disorders in the population, social networks and the influence of drug markets, law enforcement and healthcare services on drug use and associated health outcomes. This project will 1) systematically investigate the potential for emerging drug use epidemics; 2) identify the optimal allocation of resources towards combination of interventions to control them and limit associated harms and 3) pilot a targeted mass-media based intervention to increase access to appropriate prevention methods among a specific population at risk of an emerging drug use in real time as identified by the model. This project has the potential to significantly improve our public health response to emerging drug use epidemics and to reduce their toll on the health of the United States population. Project narrative Over the past two decades, three consecutive waves of emerging opioid epidemics and intersecting drug use epidemics have claimed more than 600,000 lives across the U.S. and caused drug use associated HIV outbreaks in previously unaffected rural populations. The harms are increasing exponentially with over 70,000 overdose deaths occurring in the past year only. This project proposes to use dynamic mathematical modeling to predict and effectively respond to emerging drug use epidemic threats and associated HIV, HCV and fatal overdose incidence.",Real-time prediction of emerging drug use epidemics in the United States,9822752,DP2DA049295,"['Cities ', ' Communication ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Equipment ', ' Explosion ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' mass information media ', ' Mass Media ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Methods ', ' Overdose ', ' Politics ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Rural Population ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Social Network ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Inequality ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' disease transmission ', ' infectious disease transmission ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' drug market ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Emerging Communicable Diseases ', ' Emerging Infectious Diseases ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Abate ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' trend ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' overdose death ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' HCV ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opiate crisis ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",DP2,2019,2367000,0.17010969683654675
"Risk Factors for AIDS among Drug Users: Getting Close to Zero ﻿    DESCRIPTION: UNAIDS has announced a goal of Getting to Zero New HIV infections and Secretary Clinton has announced a goal of an AIDS free generation. Completely eliminating new HIV infections may not be possible in any large population of persons at high risk for HIV, but combined prevention, including treatment as prevention (TasP) may permit getting very close to zero new HIV infections. Psychoactive drug use generates many impediments getting close to zero. Drug use can lead to HIV infection through both sharing injection equipment and through drug use related unsafe sexual behavior. Drug use may also interfere with accessing and adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Psychoactive drug use is also strongly associated with higher rates of HIV infection among racial/ethnic minorities. In this research, we will examine whether combined prevention can get close to zero new HIV infections among injecting and non-injecting drug users in New York City, including whether getting close to zero can minimize racial/ethnic disparities.  If combined prevention does lead to getting close to zero new infections drug users in NYC. This will require a) an analytic description of combined prevention, b) a clear conceptualization of getting close to zero, and c) new metrics and methods for assessing being close to zero.  We will study getting close to zero new HIV infections for drug users in NYC through four specific aims: 1. Determine the extent to which combined prevention  is getting close to zero for injecting related transmission of HIV in NYC. Develop new metrics for measuring a CtZ situation for injecting-related transmission and how racial/ethnic disparities might be minimized. 2. Conduct mathematical modeling, using biomarkers for high injecting risk (HCV infection) and high sexual risk (HSV-2 infection) and behavioral data to analyze HIV infection among PWID in terms of: 1) the PWID population as a whole, 2) disparities among major racial/ethnic groups, 3) sustainability for maintaining a CTZ situation with combined prevention, and 4) injecting related vs. sexual transmission of HIV among PWID. 3. Determine the extent to which ""combined prevention"" is reducing drug related sexual (DRS) transmission of HIV among non-injecting drug users (NIDUs) and PWID in NYC. Develop new metrics for measuring the potential for continuing sexual transmission and assess coverage of Treatment as Prevention (TasP) among NIDUs. Monitor trends in HSV-2 infection as a continuing driver of drug use sexual transmission. 4. Utilize geospatial analysis to characterize ""hotspots"" for continuing transmission of HIV among drug users in NYC, including potential geographic overlap between injecting related and sexual transmission of HIV, and racial/ethnic and HIV service characteristics of hotspots.  We will accomplish these aims through interviews and HIV, HCV, and HSV-2 testing of 600 subjects per year and continuation of our long-standing collaborations with the NY City and State Health Departments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: UNAIDS has announced a goal of ""getting to zero"" new HIV infections and the US government has announced a parallel goal of achieving ""an AIDS free generation. We will study whether combined prevention leads to ""getting close to zero"" new HIV infections for injecting and non-injecting drug users in New York City. This will include developing bio-behavioral metrics for use in getting close to zero, mathematical modeling, and identifying geographic ""hotspots"" of persistent probability of HIV transmission.",Risk Factors for AIDS among Drug Users: Getting Close to Zero,9625114,R01DA003574,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Cities ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Equipment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' hep C ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' human alphaherpesvirus 2 ', ' herpes simplex ii ', ' Human herpes simplex virus type 2 ', ' Human (alpha) herpes virus 2 ', ' Herpesvirus progenitalis ', ' Herpesvirus 2 (alpha), Human ', ' Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 ', ' Herpes Simplex Virus 2 ', ' HSV2 ', ' HSV-2 ', ' HHV-2 ', ' Human Herpesvirus 2 ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HIV Seroprevalence ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Infection ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' New York ', ' New York City ', ' Probability ', ' Psychopharmaceuticals ', ' Psychoactive Drugs ', ' Psychoactive Compound ', ' Psychoactive Agents ', ' Psychotropic Drugs ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Social Marketing ', ' Testing ', ' Vaccines ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Syringe Sharing ', ' Needlesharing ', ' Needle Sharing ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Needle-Exchange Programs ', ' syringe service programs ', ' syringe exchange services ', ' syringe exchange ', ' needle exchange ', ' Syringe-Exchange Programs ', ' Collaborations ', ' Drug user ', ' persons who use drugs ', ' people who use illicit drugs ', ' people who use drugs ', ' PWUD ', ' Injecting drug user ', ' persons who inject drugs ', ' people who inject illicit drugs ', ' people who inject drugs ', ' PWID ', ' Injection Drug User ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' unprotected intercourse ', ' condomless sex ', ' condomless intercourse ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' c new ', ' condoms ', ' Prevention program ', ' prevention service ', ' Shares syringes ', ' Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Sexual Transmission ', ' sexually transmitted ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' antiretroviral therapy ', ' antiretroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral treatment ', ' anti-retroviral therapy ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' sexual HIV transmission ', ' gender disparity ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' Hepatitis C virus ', ' HCV ', ' Injections ', ' ']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,639394,0.10540491543263228
"Adaptation and Implementation of Project Encuentro in the U.S.-Mexico Border ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project is a research collaboration between the University of Texas at El Paso, The Alliance for Border Collaborative and Program Comparers to adapt, implement, and evaluate a multi-level, community-based, HIV prevention intervention (Project Encuentro). The intervention will target active heroin and crack users and consists of increasing access to HIV testing via a social network HIV testing component and reducing sexual and drug use risk via a peer network brief behavioral Intervention. Encuentro also consists of conducting community awareness meeting to target structural factors affecting HIV risk. The intervention was developed in an area severely affected by violence and stigma towards drug users, El Salvador, which makes it particularly suitable for adaptation to meet the needs of drug users living in the proposed intervention site, the U.S.-Mexico border. The proposed intervention site also has been severely affected by violence which has curtailed any prior attempts to reduce the risk drug users' HIV risk. Violence has worsened structural factors which affect HIV risk such as, increasing police persecution and stigma and reducing access to resources. In our proposed project, we will engage in formative research to understand the context of HIV risk of drug users in the border region post violence and adapt the intervention accordingly. Findings will allow us to tailor intervention components to meet the needs of drug users in the region. Subsequently, we propose to test intervention effectiveness and evaluate implementation barriers and facilitators. To accomplish our project aims we will use a mixed qualitative, quantitative approach. We will begin with a formative phase by conducting in-depth interviews with drug users (n = 40) living in the region to understand how the context of drug use risk changed as a result of the violence and will administer a social network survey (n = 200) to characterize the configuration of risk networks. Findings will yield the necessary information to culturally adapt the intervention to meet the needs of drug users in the region and will help us focus our recruitment efforts where the riskiest networks are located. After the intervention is adapted with the help of our community advisory board and our community coalition, we will implement the intervention and will assess the effectiveness and reach via 6 cross-sectional surveys administered to drug users (n=1,200). We will assess the process of implementation by conducting ethnographic field notes of all intervention activities including community engagement and CAB and coalition meetings. We will assess the fidelity and quality of the intervention. Lastly, we will conduct key informant interviews with key stakeholders involved in the project and interviews and observations will be coded to reflect key systems factors related to successful implementation of intervention components in two intervention sites (El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico). Findings will be highly significant as we will be conducting parallel research on the effectiveness of interventions shown to be effective in Latino drug users in two very different contexts: El Salvador and the U.S-Mexico border. Findings will elucidate implementation challenges and barriers and such information can then be used to assess the effectiveness of diverse implementation strategies in organizations working to serve the needs of Latino drug users.

"Drug Benefit Design and Adherence Disparities in Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract Underuse of clinically effective medications among minority adults in midlife may contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in chronic disease related morbidity and mortality in late life. Medication affordability has been identified as an important driver of disparities in treatment adherence and recent trends in employer-sponsored prescription drug coverage toward increased patient cost sharing (e.g., copays) have the potential to exacerbate these disparities. Yet, there is a paucity of strong research evidence on the effects of out-of-pocket (OOP) drug costs on disparities in treatment adherence over the life course. In a prior study, we found evidence of a complex relationship between OOP drug costs and adherence which likely differs by race and ethnicity over time. For example, as patients age and OOP costs increase due to higher drug burden, patients may become more sensitive to cumulative drug costs regardless of race or ethnicity. In addition, potentially modifiable factors at the provider (e.g., prescribing habits) and health system level (e.g., refill complexity) may interact with OOP drug costs in ways that exacerbate adherence disparities in midlife. However, our prior study could not adequately explore these complex and interacting factors. The primary objective of this competing renewal is to estimate the effect of OOP drug costs on disparities in medication adherence among middle-aged adults (40-64) within a large integrated health care setting (>4 million members) offering a wide variety of drug benefits and consistent access to primary care. We hypothesize that the relationship between OOP drug costs and racial and ethnic differences in adherence will be modified by age. In addition, we will examine potential interactions between OOP drug costs and modifiable factors at the provider and health system level that may amplify disparities in adherence. Focusing on patients with cardiometabolic conditions (i.e., hypertension, diabetes) and select medication classes (e.g., lipid lowering, antihypertensives, antidiabetes), we will leverage a rich longitudinal electronic medical record and employ rigorous statistical methods to estimate the effect of OOP drug costs on medication adherence overall and by race and ethnicity, including examining age-specific effects and interactions between OOP drug costs and modifiable factors at the provider and health system level. In addition, we will identify aids and barriers to integrating health equity as a measurable criterion for evaluating drug benefit designs and relevant contextual factors from the perspective of decision makers (e.g., employers, health plans, pharmacy benefit managers). If successful the proposed study has the potential to inform the design of drug benefits that simultaneously promote clinical effectiveness and equitable health care outcomes. Narrative Underuse of clinically effective medications among minority adults in midlife may contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in chronic disease related morbidity and mortality in late life. The primary objective of this competing renewal is to enhance our understanding of the relationship between out-of-pocket drug costs and disparities in adherence to evidence-based treatments in midlife and to inform the design of drug benefits that simultaneously promote clinical effectiveness and equitable health care outcomes.",Drug Benefit Design and Adherence Disparities in Older Adults,9990921,R56AG032249,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' anti-depressive agents ', ' anti-depressants ', ' anti-depressant drugs ', ' anti-depressant agent ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Deductibles ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Drug Design ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Lipids ', ' Literature ', ' Mail Order ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Time ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Drug Costs ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Cost Sharing ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' uptake ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' member ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Excision ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Measurable ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' trend ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' cost ', ' pharmacy benefit ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Natural experiment ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' treatment adherence ', ' health equity ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health plan ', ' health plans ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' ']",NIA,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R56,2019,736746,0.14161740542440357
"Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The Western States (WS) Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) promotes evidence-based drug abuse prevention and treatment services through continued participation in the CTN. The Node 1) designs and implements clinical trials of evidence-based treatments of addiction through rapid recruitment of diverse study participants in partnership with NIDA and the CTN, 2) generates peer-reviewed publications in collaboration with treatment providers and other nodes, and 3) uses the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Regional Research and Training Center includes talented faculty and staff from Oregon Health & Science Center and University of California, San Francisco as well as leaders of affiliated healthcare partners providing integrated primary care and substance use disorder treatment. The Node was created in 2010 as an amalgam of two CTN Nodes--California-Arizona and Oregon/Hawaii (a charter member of the CTN). The Node was highly successful, during the current award, participating in 10 CTN trials, co-leading two of these and leading one; reporting results of CTN main studies, ancillary, and research using the CTN platform in 100+ publications, and actively disseminating evidence- based practices in 200 presentations. Node investigators also sought and received awards for 10 studies that used the CTN as a platform for research. Eight WS Node healthcare programs recruited over 1,300 participants into CTN studies. In the coming grant period the Node expands to include three national and regional primary care and HIV primary care research networks: OCHIN, the HIV Research Network, and the Oregon Rural Practice-Based Research Network (ORPRN). The Node retains core addiction treatment centers experienced in CTN protocols and exploits their links with primary care: Adapt (Roseburg, OR), CODA (Portland, OR) HealthRIGHT 360 (San Francisco, CA), La Frontera (Tucson, AZ), NARA (Portland, OR), and Signal Behavioral Health Network (Denver, CO). The Node's research agenda proposes study concepts that evaluate three strategies to integrate and enhance addiction treatment within healthcare settings. Study 1 builds a patient registry for HCV infection and tests a multi-contact brief intervention for alcohol use. Study 2 extends the registry testing a candidate therapeutic HIV vaccine. Study 3, a test of reverse integration (primary care clinicians in addiction treatment settings), assesses naloxone distribution and education to reduce fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses and measures impact on return to use. Finally the WS Node continues to use the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Node has the potential to accelerate the advancement of integrated primary care and addiction in the coming years. PROJECT NARRATIVE This renewal application to conduct research in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network has broad public health implications focused on developing and testing ways to better treat medical problems and addiction through integrated care. The project will conduct clinical trials of treatments for drug use disorders in the context of primary care addressing hepatitis C, HIV, and opioid overdose--topics of urgent national importance.

"Biomarkers for Dysbiosis-Related HIV-Associated Cognitive Disorders among Persons Who Inject Drugs in Puerto Rico ABSTRACT The current opioid injection incidence in the United States has risen to epidemic levels and is associated with increased risk of HIV-1 transmission and disease progression as well as with other infections in several US states. Given that most HIV+ people who inject drugs (PWID) are now likely to receive anti-retroviral therapy, traditional bio-markers such as HIV viral load and CD4 counts are unlikely to provide a comprehensive assessment of disease progression especially as it affects neurocognitive performance. New biomarkers are needed to track the effects of ongoing HIV infection as it impacts neurocognitive functions. Candidate biomarkers can be found in the interaction between HIV infection, dysbiosis, microbial translocation and systematic inflammation. HIV-1 infection is associated with lymphoid depletion in tissues underlying the gut epithelium, allowing microbial products to transduce into the parenchyma where they act as potent inducers of systemic inflammation. Even when HIV-1 viral load is suppressed by anti-retroviral treatment, chronic immune activation resulting from dysbiosis and translocation can persist. Opioid use also induces gut dysbiosis and supports bacterial translocation. The resulting inappropriate immune activation in PWID may enhance HIV-1 replication, lead to premature aging of T cells, and promote HIV disease progression, including exacerbated HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND). A more comprehensive set of markers is therefore needed to better understand the course of HIV infection among people who inject drugs (PWID)—biomarkers that reflect the combined physiologic impact of ongoing injection drug use and a range of biomic changes that can exaggerate and reinforce the cumulative impact of physiological effects on mental health. The overall objective of our proposed study is to advance the understanding of the effects of HIV infection and injection drug use on the microbiome, with the goal of discovering biomarkers for neurological disease progression among PWID that are related to chronic inflammation and dysbiosis coupled inflammation. Our highly experienced research team will make use of a well-established cohort of PWID in Puerto Rico—a region with historically high levels of injection drug use and an HIV incidence rate that is disproportionately associated with drug use. A prospective, multi-cohort longitudinal study will allow repeated measures from the study population and compare them with similar measures from control groups of HIV negative PWID and HIV-1 infected non-drug users from the same location. This longitudinal evaluation will allow our team to test the hypothesis that HIV-1 infection in PWID intensifies dysbiosis and inflammation which, in turn, exacerbates HIV replication, HAND and HIV treatment failures. We expect that this hypothesis, if true, will have important implications for the emerging drug epidemic in remainder of the United States. In addition to meeting the goals of RFA 18-023, this project will contribute to NIDA and OBSSR's strategic plans for research that bridges pre-clinical and socio-behavioral research, and is responsive to the NIH-wide mandate of improving minority health and reducing health disparities in the United States. NARRATIVE Given the high numbers of new injectors emerging from the rising opioid epidemic, a more comprehensive set of biomarkers is needed to fully understand neurocognitive impacts of HIV infection in people who inject drugs (PWID) in the United States today. This project advances the search for novel biomarkers by examining the links between HIV infection, dysbiosis, microbial translocation, and systemic inflammation among HIV-1 infected PWID in Puerto Rico as these factors predict the neurocognitive disorders known as HAND (HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders). A prospective, multi-cohort longitudinal study will allow repeated measures from the study population and compare them with similar measures from control groups of HIV negative PWID and HIV- 1 infected non-drug users from the same location.",Biomarkers for Dysbiosis-Related HIV-Associated Cognitive Disorders among Persons Who Inject Drugs in Puerto Rico,9687938,R01DA047823,"['Affect ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive disease ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' Control Groups ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' HIV1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV-1 ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kentucky ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maine ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Couples-based intervention to reduce drug use and HIV transmission Project Summary YMSM in relationships with other men face unique and compounded risk factors for both drug use and HIV infection. Their vulnerability is unique from older MSM, unpartnered MSM and their heterosexual peers. This enhanced vulnerability emerges as exactly the developmental period when the establishment of romantic relationships emerges as salient. Despite their unique vulnerability for HIV infection and challenges related to drug use, there are very few couples- based intervention options for YMSM. There are presently no brief, couples-based interventions which integrate a focus on drug use and HIV prevention. The proposed study is geared toward the development of such an intervention. The only individually delivered intervention for YMSM to show significant reductions in both drug use and sexual HIV transmission risk behavior, the Young Men’s Health Project (YMHP) was developed by members of this research team. YMHP focused on sexual risk in the context of casual partners. Beginning with this framework, our team has completed the initial stages of revising YMHP for use with couples, resulting in the creation of the Couple’s Health Project (CHP). Our formative work suggests that the prototype intervention is feasible and acceptable to participants. The next step is to develop components of the intervention which address pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake and to determine how best to integrate biological testing for STI’s and drug use into the study. The new intervention will be informed by qualitative data gathered from intervention sessions delivered in our formative work and from qualitative interviews conducted with 20 HIV negative partnered YMSM. The final 28 months of the project are devoted to a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing CHP to an attention-matched educational control condition. The study team is led by Dr. Tyrel J. Starks (PI), a new investigator with substantial experience in the study of gay male couples. He has collaborated on numerous projects examining the nature of sexual agreements and their association with substance use and HIV transmission risk behavior. He is supported by a study team which includes Dr. Jeffrey Parsons, the PI of the original YMHP study. The team brings extensive experience in quantitative and qualitative data analysis, HIV prevention research, and specifically intervention development. Project Narrative – Public Health Significance HIV prevention strategies that address the specific needs of YMSM in stable relationships with other men are needed in response to accumulating evidence which points to the unique vulnerability of these men. The proposed project builds upon an effective individual intervention, the Young Men’s Health Project, to develop a couples-based intervention which addresses drug use and sexual HIV transmission risk among partnered HIV negative YMSM (ages 18-29). Preliminary work by our research team has produced a prototype manual, and provided compelling evidence of feasibility and acceptability. The proposed project will revise this prototype manual to enhance the focus on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and to incorporate biological testing for drug use and STIs into the study. During Phase II, a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 50 couples will test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the new intervention relative to an attention-matched educational control.",Couples-based intervention to reduce drug use and HIV transmission,9647452,R34DA043422,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Amphetamines ', ' dl-Amphetamine ', ' Phenopromin ', ' Phenamine ', ' Desoxynorephedrin ', ' Attention ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Communication ', ' Counseling ', ' Couples ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Ketamine ', ' male ', ' Manuals ', ' marihuana ', ' Marijuana ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Motivation ', ' NO3- ', ' Nitrates ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' free base cocaine ', ' Crack Cocaine ', ' Latino ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine ', ' N,alpha-dimethyl-1,3-benzodioxole-5-ethanamine ', ' Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ', ' MDMA ', ' 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine ', ' ecstasy ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Structure of nail of finger ', ' Fingernail ', ' Finger Nail ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Gays ', ' uptake ', ' Anal Sex ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Couples Therapy ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Nature ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' 4-hydroxybutyric acid ', ' gamma-hydroxybutyric acid ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' prevention service ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Biological Testing ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Update ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Preparation ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' male health ', "" men's health "", ' trial comparing ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' prototype ', ' standard of care ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' follow up assessment ', ' followup assessment ', ' young man ', ' adolescent men ', ' adolescent man ', ' same-sex partnership ', ' same-sex couple ', ' same sex relationship ', ' same sex partner ', ' sexual HIV transmission ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' efficacy study ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIDA,HUNTER COLLEGE,R34,2019,148200,0.0832515560440776
"Frailty, HIV Infection, Injection Drug Use and the Inflammatory-Microbiome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), life expectancy for HIV-infected persons has markedly improved, yet marked deficits in survival remain for HIV-infected persons with a history of injecting drugs (PWID). Disparities among PWID have been attributed in part to a shifting spectrum of disease to aging-associated conditions driven by persistent inflammation even with ART. Frailty is an important aging-related state of vulnerability to stress, with an increased burden in HIV infection, strongly associated with heightened inflammation, and predictive of premature mortality and aging-related morbidity among PWID. Injecting drugs itself can increase the severity of inflammation in HIV. The human gut microbial ecosystem (gut microbiome) critically regulates inflammation and immunity. Alterations in the gut microbiome (gut dysbiosis) together with associated disruptions of gut structure and immune integrity constitute an inflammatory-microbiome signature (gut dysbiosis, increased gut permeability, translocation of microbial products, immune activation, heightened inflammation) linked to adverse aging-associated inflammatory conditions and disease. Proposed is a systematic investigation of the role of HIV infection and injection drug use (IDU) in defining the inflammatory- microbiome signature and determination of the relationship of this signature to frailty. Through assessments of the fecal and mucosal microbiome in the AIDS Linked to the IntraVenous Experience (ALIVE) cohort of HIV- infected and epidemiologically comparable HIV-uninfected PWID, we will determine how HIV infection and active IDU alter microbiome composition and function and the relationship of these changes to inflammation and frailty progression over time. Using a germ free murine model, we will further define the frail human microbial communities and gene products that precipitate inflammation. These studies will facilitate elucidation of gut microbial determinants of frailty among HIV-infected PWID and could significantly inform microbiota modulation strategies to reduce frailty-associated inflammation beyond ART. Understanding the role of the gut microbiome in relation to HIV, injection drug use, and frailty remains a critical next step to reducing the marked disparities in clinical outcomes among HIV-infected PWID. PROJECT NARRATIVE Persons co-impacted by HIV infection and drug use are living longer with effective antiretroviral therapy, but many still die much earlier and experience a heavy burden of frailty and age-related disease. We seek to understand how microbes in the gut may be linked to inflammation, how this process may be impacted by HIV and injection drug use, and how these factors may contribute to age-related diseases or frailty. Knowledge gained from these studies could inform development of effective strategies to improve survival and quality of life for persons aging with HIV infection and drug use.","Frailty, HIV Infection, Injection Drug Use and the Inflammatory-Microbiome",9789154,R01AG060825,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Motility ', ' Cellular Motility ', ' Cellular Migration ', ' Cell Movement ', ' Cell Migration ', ' Cell Locomotion ', ' cell motility ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cocaine ', ' Colon ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Heroin ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Gene Pool ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Immunity ', ' Inflammation ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' liver disorder ', ' hepatopathy ', ' hepatic disease ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' Liver diseases ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Y2Prevent: Preventing Drug Use and HIV through Empowerment, Social Support and Mentorship ABSTRACT African Americans represent only 14% of the population, but account for 44% of all new HIV infections reported yearly. The situation is particularly grave for Black/African American young men who have sex with men (AAYMSM), with seroprevalence rates of 19% for ages 15-22 and 26% for ages 23-29 among AAYMSM. These health outcomes are influenced by important social and structural factors, including violence and victimization, homophobia, discrimination, institutional racism, and economic and social marginalization. These experiences are significantly associated with illicit drug use, alcohol misuse, transactional sex work, and HIV risk behaviors. In response to this crisis, we are proposing to create a new theoretically driven, youth- centered intervention designed to build the capacity of AAYMSM to overcome these barriers to health. With this revised R34 application, we propose to further refine and pilot test an intervention, called Young Men's Adult Identity Mentoring (YM-AIM). Adapted from an existing CDC Diffusing Effective Behavioral Intervention, YM-AIM is a theory-driven, group-level intervention designed to help AAYMSM develop a healthy vision for their future (or “possible future self”) by defining a set of short- and long-term goals in the areas of education, health, family and intimate relationships. We propose to further strengthen and refine YM-AIM by adding a youth mentoring/support component, called Youth Initiated Mentoring (YIM). YIM uses a positive youth development framework to: a) build social capital to achieve immediate and long-term goals, b) build social support, c) identify and engage natural mentors in one's networks to address structural barriers, and d) develop relationships with supportive adults. We will integrate these two models into a single intervention called Y2Prevent. We will then work to further adapt, tailor, and evaluate Y2Prevent as an intervention to reduce illicit drug use and HIV/STI risk among AAYMSM. This intervention will emphasize: a) biomedical HIV prevention strategies for primary prevention, b) HIV/STI testing and treatment referral, c) drug screening and treatment referral, and d) positive youth development and future planning. We will conduct formative research to inform the adaptation/tailoring followed by a piloting of the new intervention to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and the preliminary efficacy. Our proposed positive youth development and resilience theory provide a strong, innovative framework for examining how AAYMSM with significant exposure to syndemic health and social disparities respond to engagement with prevention and treatment resources. The proposed intervention is intended to promote resilience, build social skills and assets among AAYMSM to help them recognize and overcome individual, social and structural barriers leading to risk, and adopt and maintain protective behaviors, such as safer sex, PrEP/PEP use, HIV/STI testing and healthcare utilization. The findings will inform the development of an R01 application that will propose a larger-scale, multi-city efficacy trail in a subsequent R01 application. PROJECT NARRATIVE Today there is a generation of African American/Black young men who have sex with men (AAYMSM) who are at exceedingly high risk for a wide range of adverse health outcomes, including tobacco, alcohol and illicit drug addiction, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV/AIDS, and mental health disorders. Often, these young men experience multiple forms of discrimination (racism, homophobia) in multiple settings (home, school, neighborhood, workplace), with limited social support to buffer against these threats. In response, we propose to further refine and pilot test a theory-driven, evidence-based group-level intervention designed to help AAYMSM develop a healthy vision for their future (or “possible future self”) by defining a set of short- and long- term goals in the areas of education, health, family and intimate relationships using facilitated activities -- participants are asked to consider how their involvement in risky behaviors (e.g., illicit drug use, condomless sex, multiple sex partners) would interfere with achieving those goals.","Y2Prevent: Preventing Drug Use and HIV through

"Effects of State-Level Policy Implementation on Opiate Abuse and Mortality Project Summary States have responded to the current opiate crisis through implementing several different types of policies, such as prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), expanded naloxone access, and Good Samaritan immunity. At present, the full efficacy of each of these policies is unknown beyond examinations of a limited set of policies, localities, or years. This research study will use causal statistical methods and a robust policy database to examine the impact of relevant policies on opiate use, dependence, and fatal overdose from 1999 to the present. For policy data, we will employ the new and as yet underutilized NIDA-funded Prescription Drug Abuse Policy System (PDAPS) to evaluate the effects of opiate relevant policies. We will accomplish this goal by coding this database by state and year and combining it with mortality data from the Center of Disease Control and data on use and dependence from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, as well as time- varying control measures from the U.S. Census Bureau and FBI Uniform Crime Reports. We will analyze this dataset using fixed effects and difference-in-difference models, which are causal methods for observational data well-known for the elimination of unobserved heterogeneity, such that estimators are robust to any observable or unobservable time-invariant omitted variables. The fixed effects and difference-in-difference approaches respectively provide a causal interpretation of (a) whether a given state experiences a decrease in opiate outcomes after passing a particular policy, and (b) whether a state that passes a policy experiences a decrease in opiate outcomes relative to a state that does not have that policy. The PDAPS database contains detailed policy information (e.g. to whom practitioners can prescribe naloxone, who has access to PDMPs), such that we can determine which of the nuanced approaches to these policies are most efficacious. We will examine whether each policy component affects use, dependence, and fatal overdose for opiates generally as well as separately for prescription opiates and heroin. In addition, we will test for synergistic effects of policy; that is, whether the combination of any given policies is particularly effective. Finally, we will conduct these analyses by key demographics: gender, race/ethnicity, age, and urbanicity, which will permit the identification of related health disparities. Our proposed exploratory research provides an opportunity to test the impact of a rapidly evolving policy landscape on opiate outcomes and will contribute in additional ways. First, if certain policies or combinations of policies are identified as efficacious, the results would provide evidence for broader adoption to curb the current opiate crisis. Second, the identification of possible health disparities in the benefits of policy implementation may not only help public health professionals to work towards redressing these disparities, but also identify policies that may “bypass” social inequalities to provide comprehensive benefits to citizens. Finally, this exploratory study establishes a foundation for future research that will consider local policy variation, individual-level policy-driven changes, and non-fatal overdose. Project Narrative An unprecedented opiate crisis has emerged over the past decade in the U.S., and state governments have responded by implementing numerous policies to disrupt this trend. This study uses fixed effects modeling to determine which opiate-related policies have been effective in curbing opiate use, dependence, and fatal overdose by combining state-level data from the Center for Disease Control, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, and the new NIDA-funded Prescription Drug Abuse Policy System, which identifies policies related to naloxone access, prescription drug monitoring programs, Good Samaritan immunity, and medical marijuana. By examining the independent and interactive effects of policies, along with analyses of their effects by key demographic characteristics, this project has the potential to improve morbidity and mortality related to the opiate crisis as well as address health disparities related to this issue.",Effects of State-Level Policy Implementation on Opiate Abuse and Mortality,9701954,R21DA046447,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Censuses ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Crime ', ' relational database management systems ', ' database systems ', ' Data Base Management Systems ', ' Database Management Systems ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Heroin ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Immunity ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Naloxone ', ' opioid drug abuse ', ' opiate drug abuse ', ' opiate abuse ', ' opioid abuse ', ' Overdose ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Societies ', ' Provincial Government ', ' State Government ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Pain Clinics ', ' Pain Relief Units ', ' Pain Centers ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Dependence ', ' System ', ' misuse of prescription only drugs ', ' prescription misuse ', ' prescription drug misuse ', ' nonmedical prescription drug use ', ' non-medical prescription drug use ', ' Prescription medication misuse ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' social inequality ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' Bypass ', ' prescription drug abuse ', ' prescription medication abuse ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Outcome ', ' demographics ', ' prescription opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' opioid medication ', ' opiate medication ', ' licit opioid ', ' Medical Marijuana ', ' medicinal cannabis ', ' medical cannabis ', ' Medicinal Marijuana ', ' improved outcome ', ' opioid use ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opiate use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' Time trend ', ' Trends over time ', ' Temporal trend ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid overdose ', ' opioid toxicity ', ' opioid related overdose ', ' opioid poisoning ', ' opioid medication overdose ', ' opioid intoxication ', ' opioid induced overdose ', ' opioid drug overdose ', ' opiate related overdose ', ' opiate overdose ', ' opioid mortality ', ' opioid related death ', ' opioid overdose death ', ' opioid deaths ', ' opiate mortality ', ' opiate deaths ', ' heroin use ', ' heroin intake ', ' prescription monitoring program ', ' Prescription Drug Monitoring Program ', ' prescription opioid misuse ', ' prescription opiate misuse ', ' opioid prescription medication misuse ', ' opioid medication misuse ', ' opioid analgesic misuse ', ' nonmedical use of prescription opioids ', ' nonmedical use of prescription opiates ', ' non-medical use of prescription opioids ', ' non-medical use of prescription opiates ', ' ']",NIDA,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,190468,0.1321423894795368
"Cohort Studies on HIV/AIDS and Substance Abuse in Miami ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Liver disease is a major cause of death in HIV infected persons in the United States. While advances in antiretroviral therapy have significantly reduced HIV-related mortality, co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), is widespread and accelerates progression of liver fibrosis to cirrhosis and liver carcinoma. In addition, substance abuse accelerates HIV disease, and may facilitate progression of liver fibrosis. The primary goal of this proposal is to continue to follow the existing Miami Adult Studies on HIV (MASH) cohort, its specimen repository and database, and expand it from the current 881 to 1,500 study participants. The purpose is to generate collaborative studies to investigate the impact of cocaine, by far the most prevalent drug of abuse in South Florida, on HIV infection, HIV/HCV co-infection, and on long-term morbidity with a focus on liver disease in this population with disparities in access to care. HIV and HCV un-infected cocaine users and non-users will also be recruited to allow determination of the impact of cocaine use alone, as well as the interaction of cocaine use with HIV, HCV, and HIV/HCV co-infection. As new and more effective treatments and access to care for HIV, HCV and drug abuse become available, maintaining a well- characterized cohort, specimen repository and database will create a strong resource platform for current and future collaborative research. Observing the uptake of new HCV treatments and potential new cocaine cessation programs in this at-risk population with health disparities will provide data on barriers and facilitators to effective treatments to prevent long-term morbidity and mortality. We have followed the MASH cohort of 881 participants for up to 12 years with excellent retention rates, and have created a specimen repository and a database. The MASH cohort in Miami is unique because it will be a mostly Hispanic cohort with a large number of African Americans, women, non-injector drug users, with predominantly heterosexual HIV- transmission etiology. We propose to (1) compare the progression of liver fibrosis over four years among cocaine users and non-users in HIV+/HCV-, HIV+/HCV+, HIV-/HCV+, and HIV-/HCV-, using a novel non- invasive diagnostic device, the Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE). We also propose to (2) compare the pattern over four years of biomarkers and identify genetic markers associated with the mechanisms of liver fibrosis among cocaine users and non-users. Understanding the role of cocaine use in the context of HIV and HIV/HCV co-infections and lack of lasting effects of treatments for cocaine use cessation are crucial in order to gain insights into the pathogenesis and disease outcomes, and to provide the basis for identifying antifibrotic therapies such as oxidative stress, which are amenable to intervention. These studies will be critical for program development, appropriate interventions, and for improving health in this population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the role of cocaine use in the context of HIV, HCV and HIV/HCV co-infections with focus on progression of liver fibrosis, is crucial in gaining insights into the disease pathogenesis, outcomes, and the role of co-morbidities and health disparities of this population.

"Reducing Black Men's Drug Use and Co-Occurring Negative Mental and Physical Health Outcomes: Intersectionality, Social-Structural Stressors, and Protective Factors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health inequities among Black men in the U.S. are stark. Drug use contributes to six of the top ten leading causes of death among Black men ages 18 to 54. Social-structural stressors such as discrimination, based on race or race and sexual identity, and drug use to cope with stress, are well-documented pathways to drug use among Black adults. Empirical evidence that drug use co-occurs with other negative health outcomes underscores an urgent public health need to examine drug use and other co-occurring negative health outcomes associated with social-structural stressors. Single-axis perspectives—either race or sexual identity— dominate drug use and health disparities research. Apart from HIV/AIDS research, research on the effects of social-structural stressors on Black men’s drug use and co-occurring negative health outcomes at the intersection of sexual identity (i.e., heterosexual, sexual minority) and socioeconomic position (SEP) is virtually nonexistent. Critical gaps also exist about how protective factors (e.g., resilience, religiosity, positive racial/sexual identity) influence the effects of social-structural stressors on Black men’s drug use and co- occurring negative health outcomes. To address these critical gaps, a longitudinal cross-lagged explanatory- sequential (QUANT→qual) mixed methods study is proposed to test, via structural equation modeling, a conceptual model of social-structural stressors, protective factors, and drug use (alcohol, marijuana, nicotine, illicit drug use) and co-occurring negative mental (e.g., psychological distress) and physical (e.g., blood pressure) health outcomes among Black men at the intersection of sexual identity and SEP. Purposive quota sampling will be used to recruit 960 Black men, ages 18-54, stratified by sexual identity and SEP (240/group) in Washington, DC. Phase I includes the collection of self-reported social-structural stressors, protective factors, drug use, and mental health data, and objective drug use (i.e., urine toxicology) and physical health (e.g., blood pressure) data at Time 1, and 3 months later at Time 2 (Aims 1, 2). Blood samples will be collected at Time 2 only to assess cardiovascular disease biomarkers (e.g., total cholesterol). Phase II includes 4 focus groups with 6-8 Phase I participants (total n = 24 to 32) purposively sampled to explain Phase I results (Aim 3). Phase III involves a synthesis and validity assessment of the quantitative and qualitative results (Aim 3). The proposed research uses intersectionality, social-structural stress, and resilience theoretical frameworks to advance new and important knowledge about the extent to which social-structural stressors and protective factors influence drug use and co-occurring negative health outcomes among Black men at the intersection of sexual identity and SEP. This intersectional focus represents a paradigmatic shift from conventional single-axis and one-size-fits-all intervention approaches. The significance of the proposed research lies in the expected outcome of the future development of multi-level (i.e., individual and social-structural) interventions to reduce drug use and promote mental and physical health among Black men at different intersectional positions of risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed explanatory-sequential (QUANT→qual) mixed-methods longitudinal cross-lagged study is relevant to public health because, in alignment with the NIDA Epidemiology Research Branch’s mission, it advances new knowledge about the effects of social-structural stressors and protective factors on drug use and co-occurring negative mental and physical health outcomes for Black men at the intersection of sexual identity and socioeconomic position (SEP). A significant benefit of the proposed research is that it will have broad translational importance for future health disparities research and interventions designed to reduce drug use and health disparities among and between populations at multiple marginalized intersectional positions (e.g., race, gender, sexual identity, and SEP). The project advances new horizons about the effects of intersectional positions and related social-structural stressors and protective factors on drug use and co- occurring negative mental and physical health outcomes that conventional single-axis (e.g., either race or sexual identity) approaches obscure.","Reducing Black Men's Drug Use and Co-Occurring Negative Mental and Physical Health Outcomes: Intersectionality, Social-Structural Stressors, and Protective Factors",9731450,R01DA045773,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Homicide ', ' marihuana ', ' Marijuana ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Nicotine ', ' Political Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Stress ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Washington ', ' Gender ', ' Police ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Unintentional Injury ', ' Accidental Injury ', ' base ', ' Bisexual ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Area ', ' Imprisonment ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Phase ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Gays ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Social status ', ' social standing ', ' social position ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' MSM ', ' virtual ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' stress resilience ', ' Population ', ' male health ', "" men's health "", ' multidisciplinary ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' sexual minority ', ' health data ', ' illicit drug use ', ' racial identity ', ' intersectionality ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' sexual identity ', ' ']",NIDA,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,638616,0.10473788718971687
"Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  The Western States (WS) Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) promotes evidence-based drug abuse prevention and treatment services through continued participation in the CTN. The Node 1) designs and implements clinical trials of evidence-based treatments of addiction through rapid recruitment of diverse study participants in partnership with NIDA and the CTN, 2) generates peer-reviewed publications in collaboration with treatment providers and other nodes, and 3) uses the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Regional Research and Training Center includes talented faculty and staff from Oregon Health & Science Center and University of California, San Francisco as well as leaders of affiliated healthcare partners providing integrated primary care and substance use disorder treatment. The Node was created in 2010 as an amalgam of two CTN Nodes--California-Arizona and Oregon/Hawaii (a charter member of the CTN). The Node was highly successful, during the current award, participating in 10 CTN trials, co-leading two of these and leading one; reporting results of CTN main studies, ancillary, and research using the CTN platform in 100+ publications, and actively disseminating evidence- based practices in 200 presentations. Node investigators also sought and received awards for 10 studies that used the CTN as a platform for research. Eight WS Node healthcare programs recruited over 1,300 participants into CTN studies. In the coming grant period the Node expands to include three national and regional primary care and HIV primary care research networks: OCHIN, the HIV Research Network, and the Oregon Rural Practice-Based Research Network (ORPRN). The Node retains core addiction treatment centers experienced in CTN protocols and exploits their links with primary care: Adapt (Roseburg, OR), CODA (Portland, OR) HealthRIGHT 360 (San Francisco, CA), La Frontera (Tucson, AZ), NARA (Portland, OR), and Signal Behavioral Health Network (Denver, CO). The Node's research agenda proposes study concepts that evaluate three strategies to integrate and enhance addiction treatment within healthcare settings. Study 1 builds a patient registry for HCV infection and tests a multi-contact brief intervention for alcohol use. Study 2 extends the registry testing a candidate therapeutic HIV vaccine. Study 3, a test of reverse integration (primary care clinicians in addiction treatment settings), assesses naloxone distribution and education to reduce fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses and measures impact on return to use. Finally the WS Node continues to use the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Node has the potential to accelerate the advancement of integrated primary care and addiction in the coming years. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This renewal application to conduct research in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network has broad public health implications focused on developing and testing ways to better treat medical problems and addiction through integrated care. The project will conduct clinical trials of treatments for drug use disorders in the context of primary care addressing hepatitis C, HIV, and opioid overdose--topics of urgent national importance.

"Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The Western States (WS) Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) promotes evidence-based drug abuse prevention and treatment services through continued participation in the CTN. The Node 1) designs and implements clinical trials of evidence-based treatments of addiction through rapid recruitment of diverse study participants in partnership with NIDA and the CTN, 2) generates peer-reviewed publications in collaboration with treatment providers and other nodes, and 3) uses the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Regional Research and Training Center includes talented faculty and staff from Oregon Health & Science Center and University of California, San Francisco as well as leaders of affiliated healthcare partners providing integrated primary care and substance use disorder treatment. The Node was created in 2010 as an amalgam of two CTN Nodes--California-Arizona and Oregon/Hawaii (a charter member of the CTN). The Node was highly successful, during the current award, participating in 10 CTN trials, co-leading two of these and leading one; reporting results of CTN main studies, ancillary, and research using the CTN platform in 100+ publications, and actively disseminating evidence- based practices in 200 presentations. Node investigators also sought and received awards for 10 studies that used the CTN as a platform for research. Eight WS Node healthcare programs recruited over 1,300 participants into CTN studies. In the coming grant period the Node expands to include three national and regional primary care and HIV primary care research networks: OCHIN, the HIV Research Network, and the Oregon Rural Practice-Based Research Network (ORPRN). The Node retains core addiction treatment centers experienced in CTN protocols and exploits their links with primary care: Adapt (Roseburg, OR), CODA (Portland, OR) HealthRIGHT 360 (San Francisco, CA), La Frontera (Tucson, AZ), NARA (Portland, OR), and Signal Behavioral Health Network (Denver, CO). The Node's research agenda proposes study concepts that evaluate three strategies to integrate and enhance addiction treatment within healthcare settings. Study 1 builds a patient registry for HCV infection and tests a multi-contact brief intervention for alcohol use. Study 2 extends the registry testing a candidate therapeutic HIV vaccine. Study 3, a test of reverse integration (primary care clinicians in addiction treatment settings), assesses naloxone distribution and education to reduce fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses and measures impact on return to use. Finally the WS Node continues to use the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Node has the potential to accelerate the advancement of integrated primary care and addiction in the coming years. PROJECT NARRATIVE This renewal application to conduct research in the NIDA Clinical Trials Network has broad public health implications focused on developing and testing ways to better treat medical problems and addiction through integrated care. The project will conduct clinical trials of treatments for drug use disorders in the context of primary care addressing hepatitis C, HIV, and opioid overdose--topics of urgent national importance. This research can accelerate the advancement of providing integrated treatments for medical problems and addiction in the coming years.",Western States Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment

"1/2 Drug Development and Capacity Building: A UCR/CoH-CCC Partnership ABSTRACT Cancer drugs in the United States are almost exclusively developed by, tested in, and optimized for European- Americans. Disparities in U.S. drug development are the result of long-standing inequalities that occur throughout the entire drug discovery pipeline. Only a small number of basic, translational and clinical scientists are Latino/Hispanic or Black/African-American. Less than 2-5% of trial participants are Latino/Hispanic or Black/African-American. Yet, in spite of a lack of data, new drugs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and subsequently prescribed for Latino/Hispanic or Black/African-American patients, without sufficient testing. It is unacceptable, especially in this era of the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), that currently our drugs are developed by, and optimized for, only for an exclusive segment of our citizens. We seek to shift this paradigm by strengthening the existing partnership between University of California at Riverside (UCR) and City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center (CoH-CCC). In this proposed P20, UCR and CoH-CCC will partner to develop the resources, infrastructure, and training programs necessary to develop the next generation of therapeutics researchers that reflect the ethnic diversity of Inland Southern California. We anticipate that our P20 program will drive new collaborative R01 grants and K01 and T-type training grants. .

"Pilot Study of a Community-Pharmacy Model to Expand Access to Medications to Treat and Prevent Hepatitis C, Opioid Use Disorders, Overdose and HIV Among Persons Who Inject Drugs ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY The opioid epidemic is a major public health crisis in the United States, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality related to the consequences of opioid use disorders and injection drug use, namely hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV, and overdose. Yet, we are at a unique historical moment, as we possess effective medications that can improve and sustain the lives of people who inject drugs (PWID). Currently there are medications that can be prescribed to 1) cure HCV (directly-acting antivirals or DAAs), 2) prevent HIV infection (Pre-exposure Prophylaxis [PrEP]), and 3) treat/prevent overdose (naloxone and medications to treat OUD). Furthermore, there is an unprecedented opportunity to eliminate HCV, a disease that is transmitted through injecting drugs. However, achieving the goals of elimination will require better systems for allowing PWID access to medications to cure hepatitis C, as well as medications to prevent overdose and HIV. Pharmacists and community-pharmacy programs may be an innovative solution for this problem. Collaborative Drug Therapy Agreements (CDTAs) allow pharmacists to have authority to autonomously perform testing and prescribing and dispensing medications. We propose to use this R34 mechanism to develop and pilot test a novel health service delivery model, namely a community-pharmacy program for providing DAAs and medications to prevent overdose and HIV among PWID with HCV. For Aim #1, we will conduct qualitative interviews with PWID with HCV and other key community stakeholders in order to inform the development of a community- pharmacy program to expand access to medications to treat HCV and prevent overdose and HIV. For Aim #2, we will pilot and evaluate the community-pharmacy program at a local pharmacy in Seattle. This application is submitted under the funding announcement PA-18-774 (“Pilot Health Services and Economic Research on the Treatment of Drug, Alcohol, and Tobacco Abuse”), which includes pilot testing of health service interventions that optimize access utilization of drug use disorder related services, as well as services for comorbid medical conditions. The proposed research leverages a number of existing community partnerships with local stakeholders and would lead to a future multi-site effectiveness study that would utilize existing community- based pharmacies in order to work toward improving drug users' health by expanding access to life-saving medications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Persons who inject drugs (PWID) face barriers to accessing efficacious and potentially life-saving medications. The purpose of the research is to develop and pilot a community-pharmacy based model of care for PWID that can offer treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV), in addition to medications to prevent overdose and HIV. The proposed research would lead to a future multi-site effectiveness study that will utilize existing community- based pharmacies to expand access to relevant medications for PWID, in order to reduce health disparities in this group and reach the World Health Organization's goal to eliminate HCV by 2030.","Pilot Study of a Community-Pharmacy Model to Expand Access to Medications to Treat and Prevent Hepatitis C, Opioid Use Disorders, Overdose and HIV Among Persons Who Inject Drugs",9978028,R34DA047660,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Antiviral Agents ', ' Antiviral Drugs ', ' Antivirals ', ' anti-viral agents ', ' anti-viral drugs ', ' anti-virals ', ' Awareness ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Community Pharmacy ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Heroin ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' Drug Utilization ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' hep C ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Incidence ', ' Indiana ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Morbidity -

"Y2Prevent: Preventing Drug Use and HIV through Empowerment, Social Support and Mentorship ABSTRACT African Americans represent only 14% of the population, but account for 44% of all new HIV infections reported yearly. The situation is particularly grave for Black/African American young men who have sex with men (AAYMSM), with seroprevalence rates of 19% for ages 15-22 and 26% for ages 23-29 among AAYMSM. These health outcomes are influenced by important social and structural factors, including violence and victimization, homophobia, discrimination, institutional racism, and economic and social marginalization. These experiences are significantly associated with illicit drug use, alcohol misuse, transactional sex work, and HIV risk behaviors. In response to this crisis, we are proposing to create a new theoretically driven, youth- centered intervention designed to build the capacity of AAYMSM to overcome these barriers to health. With this revised R34 application, we propose to further refine and pilot test an intervention, called Young Men's Adult Identity Mentoring (YM-AIM). Adapted from an existing CDC Diffusing Effective Behavioral Intervention, YM-AIM is a theory-driven, group-level intervention designed to help AAYMSM develop a healthy vision for their future (or “possible future self”) by defining a set of short- and long-term goals in the areas of education, health, family and intimate relationships. We propose to further strengthen and refine YM-AIM by adding a youth mentoring/support component, called Youth Initiated Mentoring (YIM). YIM uses a positive youth development framework to: a) build social capital to achieve immediate and long-term goals, b) build social support, c) identify and engage natural mentors in one's networks to address structural barriers, and d) develop relationships with supportive adults. We will integrate these two models into a single intervention called Y2Prevent. We will then work to further adapt, tailor, and evaluate Y2Prevent as an intervention to reduce illicit drug use and HIV/STI risk among AAYMSM. This intervention will emphasize: a) biomedical HIV prevention strategies for primary prevention, b) HIV/STI testing and treatment referral, c) drug screening and treatment referral, and d) positive youth development and future planning. We will conduct formative research to inform the adaptation/tailoring followed by a piloting of the new intervention to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and the preliminary efficacy. Our proposed positive youth development and resilience theory provide a strong, innovative framework for examining how AAYMSM with significant exposure to syndemic health and social disparities respond to engagement with prevention and treatment resources. The proposed intervention is intended to promote resilience, build social skills and assets among AAYMSM to help them recognize and overcome individual, social and structural barriers leading to risk, and adopt and maintain protective behaviors, such as safer sex, PrEP/PEP use, HIV/STI testing and healthcare utilization. The findings will inform the development of an R01 application that will propose a larger-scale, multi-city efficacy trail in a subsequent R01 application. PROJECT NARRATIVE Today there is a generation of African American/Black young men who have sex with men (AAYMSM) who are at exceedingly high risk for a wide range of adverse health outcomes, including tobacco, alcohol and illicit drug addiction, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV/AIDS, and mental health disorders. Often, these young men experience multiple forms of discrimination (racism, homophobia) in multiple settings (home, school, neighborhood, workplace), with limited social support to buffer against these threats. In response, we propose to further refine and pilot test a theory-driven, evidence-based group-level intervention designed to help AAYMSM develop a healthy vision for their future (or “possible future self”) by defining a set of short- and long- term goals in the areas of education, health, family and intimate relationships using facilitated activities -- participants are asked to consider how their involvement in risky behaviors (e.g., illicit drug use, condomless sex, multiple sex partners) would interfere with achieving those goals.","Y2Prevent: Preventing Drug Use and HIV through

"Cohort Studies on HIV/AIDS and Substance Abuse in Miami DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Liver disease is a major cause of death in HIV infected persons in the United States. While advances in antiretroviral therapy have significantly reduced HIV-related mortality, co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), is widespread and accelerates progression of liver fibrosis to cirrhosis and liver carcinoma. In addition, substance abuse accelerates HIV disease, and may facilitate progression of liver fibrosis. The primary goal of this proposal is to continue to follow the existing Miami Adult Studies on HIV (MASH) cohort, its specimen repository and database, and expand it from the current 881 to 1,500 study participants. The purpose is to generate collaborative studies to investigate the impact of cocaine, by far the most prevalent drug of abuse in South Florida, on HIV infection, HIV/HCV co-infection, and on long-term morbidity with a focus on liver disease in this population with disparities in access to care. HIV and HCV un-infected cocaine users and non-users will also be recruited to allow determination of the impact of cocaine use alone, as well as the interaction of cocaine use with HIV, HCV, and HIV/HCV co-infection. As new and more effective treatments and access to care for HIV, HCV and drug abuse become available, maintaining a well- characterized cohort, specimen repository and database will create a strong resource platform for current and future collaborative research. Observing the uptake of new HCV treatments and potential new cocaine cessation programs in this at-risk population with health disparities will provide data on barriers and facilitators to effective treatments to prevent long-term morbidity and mortality. We have followed the MASH cohort of 881 participants for up to 12 years with excellent retention rates, and have created a specimen repository and a database. The MASH cohort in Miami is unique because it will be a mostly Hispanic cohort with a large number of African Americans, women, non-injector drug users, with predominantly heterosexual HIV- transmission etiology. We propose to (1) compare the progression of liver fibrosis over four years among cocaine users and non-users in HIV+/HCV-, HIV+/HCV+, HIV-/HCV+, and HIV-/HCV-, using a novel non- invasive diagnostic device, the Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE). We also propose to (2) compare the pattern over four years of biomarkers and identify genetic markers associated with the mechanisms of liver fibrosis among cocaine users and non-users. Understanding the role of cocaine use in the context of HIV and HIV/HCV co-infections and lack of lasting effects of treatments for cocaine use cessation are crucial in order to gain insights into the pathogenesis and disease outcomes, and to provide the basis for identifying antifibrotic therapies such as oxidative stress, which are amenable to intervention. These studies will be critical for program development, appropriate interventions, and for improving health in this population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the role of cocaine use in the context of HIV, HCV and HIV/HCV co-infections with focus on progression of liver fibrosis, is crucial in gaining insights into the disease pathogenesis, outcomes, and the role of co-morbidities and health disparities of this population. This research will provide evidence-based information for program development and evaluation, appropriate and effective interventions, and for improving health in this population.",Cohort Studies on HIV/AIDS and Substance Abuse in Miami,9927614,U01DA040381,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Animals ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cocaine ', ' Cocaine Abuse ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' hep C ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Immunity ', ' Immunosuppression ', ' Immunosuppression Effect ', ' Immunosuppressive Effect ', ' immune suppression ', ' In Vitro ', ' Laboratories ', ' Liver diseases ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' hepatic disease ', ' hepatopathy ', ' liver disorder ', ' Morbidity -

"The Implementation, Adoption, and Sustainability of Ho'ouna Pono Project Summary/Abstract  Research has indicated that Native Hawaiian youth have significantly higher rates of drug use than their non-Hawaiian counterparts (e.g., Wong, Klingle, & Price, 2004; Mayeda, Hishinuma, Nishimura, Garcia- Santiago, & Mark, 2006; Nishimura, Hishinuma, & Goebert, 2013), and that these differences are particularly pronounced in rural settings (Saka, Takeuchi, Fagaragan, & Afaga, 2014). Despite these findings, there have been very few drug prevention programs developed and evaluated specifically for these youth (Edwards, Giroux, & Okamoto, 2010; Rehuher, Hiramatsu, & Helm, 2008). Further, efforts to address youth substance abuse have been poorly implemented and coordinated across the State of Hawai‘i (Waitzfelder, Engel, & Gilbert, 1998). Therefore, the purposes of this R34 proposal are to identify potential barriers or challenges to the implementation, adoption, and sustainability (IAS) of a culturally grounded, school-based drug prevention curriculum (Ho‘ouna Pono) across all public middle, intermediate, or multi-level schools on Hawai‘i Island, and to create a comprehensive, community-based IAS action plan for the curriculum. This will be accomplished through three specific aims. AIM 1 (Assessing Environmental Demands, Year 1) is to develop and validate an implementation, adoption, and sustainability inventory related to Ho‘ouna Pono, which will be theoretically informed by The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR; Damschroder & Hagedorn, 2011; Powell, Proctor, & Glass, 2014). The inventory will consist of items describing barriers or challenges to the successful adoption, implementation, and/or sustainability of Ho‘ouna Pono on Hawai‘i Island. AIM 2 (Response Enumeration, Year 2) is to systematically elicit implementation strategies (or solutions) to the most problematic and/or difficult barriers to the IAS of the curriculum in public schools on Hawai‘i Island, and to rank-order these solutions based on their perceived ability to address or overcome each of the barriers to IAS. AIM 3 (Action Plan, Year 3) is to create a community based and validated action plan based on the findings from Aims 1 and 2, which will be evaluated in a future NIDA R01 grant proposal focused on dissemination and implementation research in health. Project Narrative  Because Hawaiians or part-Hawaiians represent the largest Pacific Islander population in the U.S. (Harris & Jones, 2005) and have been shown to have significantly higher rates of drug use compared with other ethnic groups (Wu et al., 2013), research focused on drug prevention of these individuals is important to improve public health both in Hawai‘i and on the Mainland U.S. This study actively engages rural public schools and communities in assessing the implementation, adoption, and sustainability of the Ho‘ouna Pono drug prevention curriculum. The findings from this study will point to barriers and challenges to the successful implementation of evidence-based prevention curricula for rural, Pacific Islander, and indigenous communities, as well as to culturally grounded implementation strategies to promote the sustained public health impact of the curriculum.","The Implementation, Adoption, and Sustainability of Ho'ouna Pono",10123397,R34DA046735,"['Adoption ', ' Communities ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Glass ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' Interview ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Island ', ' Literature ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Administrator ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' cooking ', ' Hawaiian ', ' Hawaiian population ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Ground Substance Cytosol ', ' Ground Substance ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Indigenous ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' implementation trial ', ' youth substance abuse ', ' adolescent substance abuse ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' rural disparities ', ' Population ', ' Drug Prevention Program ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' two-dimensional ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' implementation science ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' efficacy testing ', ' prevent substance use ', ' substance use prevention ', ' population health ', ' secondary analysis ', ' indigenous community ', ' rural locality ', ' rural place ', ' rural setting ', ' Native Hawaiian ', ' clinical implementation ', ' implementation strategy ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIDA,HAWAII PACIFIC UNIVERSITY,R34,2020,95692,0.08250259884231641
"Racial and ethnic disparities in alcohol and other drug use disorder recovery (F.220) 7. Project Summary Racial/ethnic health disparities have been well-documented in the onset, rate, course, and consequences of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use problems, often with substantially poorer outcomes in non-White racial/ethnic groups compared to non-Hispanic Whites. As a result, the NIAAA has made it a central strategic aim to investigate and eliminate health disparities. Despite 30 years of research documenting the presence of AOD-related racial/ethnic health disparities, the degree to which disparities negatively impact the emerging standard of assessing the effectiveness of AOD treatments (i.e., ≥ 5 years AOD problem resolution),53 which is also when risk of problematic use is no higher than in the general population,84 is unknown. Publicly available datasets are very limited by their ability to directly measure AOD recovery-related constructs and national prevalence rates of non-White racial/ethnic groups who have achieved long-term problem resolution. In turn, this compromises our ability to assess the extent to which racial/ethnic health equality exists in terms of long- term AOD problem resolution and the recovery-related mechanisms associated with potential disparities. To begin to fill this knowledge gap, we propose to conduct secondary data analyses of the first recovery-focused nationally representative probability-based study to test if racial/ethnic health disparities exist. The National Recovery Study (PI: Kelly) consists of a web-based probability sampling frame of 39,809 adults who were screened to identify if they once had a problem with drugs or alcohol and no longer do. Complete data on 2,002 participants who answered “yes” is available. Participants were assessed with a battery of quantitative and qualitative survey items in 2016 which captured their AOD clinical history and recovery-related mechanisms associated racial/ethnic health equality in AOD problem resolution. This design will enable us to address the following aims: 1a. Test if racial/ethnic health disparities exist in (i) the duration between onset of alcohol and other drug problems and onset of problem resolution; and, (ii) the likelihood of achieving long-term problem resolution (≥ 5 years) 1b. If health disparities are observed, explore the mediating potential of psychosocial (accrued recovery capital, degree of treatment utilization, degree of recovery support-service utilization) and structural recovery-related factors (health insurance coverage, socioeconomic status, and recovery-related discrimination) in explaining observed disparities. 2. Conduct concurrent qualitative analysis to identify the top three strategies that participants report having used to resolve their alcohol or other drug problem (e.g., social support, secure accommodations, mental and physical health, financial management, employment, and recreation) and compare these strategies according to racial/ethnic characteristics. Mix the qualitative and quantitative data to determine if race/ethnicity is associated with themes identified in the recovery strategies. (F.220) 8. Project Narrative Despite 30 years of research documenting the disproportionate burden that alcohol and other drug (AOD)- related problems have on non-White racial/ethnic groups, the degree to which racial/ethnic health disparities negatively impact emerging standards for assessing the effectiveness of AOD treatments (≥ 5 years AOD problem resolution), which is when the risk of problematic use is no higher than in the general population, is unknown. This F32 postdoctoral training will aid the applicant in documenting US prevalence estimates of the number of non-White individuals who have resolved an AOD problem using data from the first nationally representative, probability-based, study of recovery. Specifically, the candidate will investigate the associations between race/ethnicity and stages of AOD problem resolution in the: 1. duration between onset of AOD problems and onset of problem resolution; and, 2. the likelihood of achieving stable long-term problem resolution. In doing so, we will establish the first line of nationally representative research on health equality in long-term AOD problem resolution and associated recovery-related mechanisms, ultimately translating findings into actionable targets for clinicians, policy, and public health proposals that can address the identified disparities.",Racial and ethnic disparities in alcohol and other drug use disorder recovery,9765118,F32AA025823,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Capital ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Occupational activity of managing finances ', ' Financial Management ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Probability ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recreation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Severities ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' alcohol and other drug ', ' Outcome ', ' alcohol related problem ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' NIAAA ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' demographics ', ' service utilization ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' alcohol consequences ', ' Secure ', ' screening ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' service programs ', ' ']",NIAAA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,F32,2020,74130,0.037463982941195906
"Adaptation and Implementation of Project Encuentro in the U.S.-Mexico Border ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project is a research collaboration between the University of Texas at El Paso, The Alliance for Border Collaborative and Program Comparers to adapt, implement, and evaluate a multi-level, community-based, HIV prevention intervention (Project Encuentro). The intervention will target active heroin and crack users and consists of increasing access to HIV testing via a social network HIV testing component and reducing sexual and drug use risk via a peer network brief behavioral Intervention. Encuentro also consists of conducting community awareness meeting to target structural factors affecting HIV risk. The intervention was developed in an area severely affected by violence and stigma towards drug users, El Salvador, which makes it particularly suitable for adaptation to meet the needs of drug users living in the proposed intervention site, the U.S.-Mexico border. The proposed intervention site also has been severely affected by violence which has curtailed any prior attempts to reduce the risk drug users' HIV risk. Violence has worsened structural factors which affect HIV risk such as, increasing police persecution and stigma and reducing access to resources. In our proposed project, we will engage in formative research to understand the context of HIV risk of drug users in the border region post violence and adapt the intervention accordingly. Findings will allow us to tailor intervention components to meet the needs of drug users in the region. Subsequently, we propose to test intervention effectiveness and evaluate implementation barriers and facilitators. To accomplish our project aims we will use a mixed qualitative, quantitative approach. We will begin with a formative phase by conducting in-depth interviews with drug users (n = 40) living in the region to understand how the context of drug use risk changed as a result of the violence and will administer a social network survey (n = 200) to characterize the configuration of risk networks. Findings will yield the necessary information to culturally adapt the intervention to meet the needs of drug users in the region and will help us focus our recruitment efforts where the riskiest networks are located. After the intervention is adapted with the help of our community advisory board and our community coalition, we will implement the intervention and will assess the effectiveness and reach via 6 cross-sectional surveys administered to drug users (n=1,200). We will assess the process of implementation by conducting ethnographic field notes of all intervention activities including community engagement and CAB and coalition meetings. We will assess the fidelity and quality of the intervention. Lastly, we will conduct key informant interviews with key stakeholders involved in the project and interviews and observations will be coded to reflect key systems factors related to successful implementation of intervention components in two intervention sites (El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico). Findings will be highly significant as we will be conducting parallel research on the effectiveness of interventions shown to be effective in Latino drug users in two very different contexts: El Salvador and the U.S-Mexico border. Findings will elucidate implementation challenges and barriers and such information can then be used to assess the effectiveness of diverse implementation strategies in organizations working to serve the needs of Latino drug users.

"Evaluating the Effectiveness of an eHealth EBI for Latino Youth in Primary Care Hispanic adolescents in the U.S. experience significant health disparities, particularly as it relates to drug use, unsafe sexual behaviors and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In spite of these disparities, a paucity of effective preventive interventions exist for Hispanic adolescents, and even fewer have been disseminated widely (IOM/NRC, 2009). Given that primary care settings are increasingly becoming the entry-point through which parents bring youth with behavioral health concerns, adolescent primary care settings represent ideal, yet underutilized, settings in which to disseminate evidence-based preventive interventions. Preventive interventions which target risk and protective factors within the family, the most proximal and fundamental social system influencing human behavior, have been found to be among the most efficacious interventions in preventing and reducing drug use and sexual risk behaviors.  Familias Unidas is a Hispanic-specific, family-based intervention found to be efficacious and effective in preventing and reducing drug use, sexual risk behaviors, and self-reported STIs. Familias Unidas has been cited by the Institute of Medicine report on Preventing, Emotional, and Behavioral among Young People as ready for broad dissemination (IOM/NRC, 2009). To date, however, Familias Unidas has been only tested for efficacy and effectiveness in schools and has not been evaluated for efficacy/effectiveness in primary care. We have adapted and evaluated Familias Unidas for online delivery; successfully retaining 80% of Hispanic parents and their youth (recruited from schools) in the online, eHealth adaptation of Familias Unidas. We have also demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of delivering eHealth Familas Unidas in primary care.  Evaluating innovative eHealth family-based interventions for Hispanic youth whose feasibility and acceptability is established in primary care settings is timely and of high public health significance. Therefore, the proposed study's overarching aim is to evaluate the relative effectiveness and cost effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas, compared to a referral to the National Institute Drug Abuse’s (NIDA) online information page for parents of Hispanic youth (referred hereafter as NIDA Online Information). To test the effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care in preventing drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and STIs in a universal sample of Hispanic youth, this study will randomize 456 Hispanic youth and their parents to eHealth Familias Unidas or to NIDA Online Information. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months post baseline. Study hypotheses are that: 1) eHealth Familias Unidas will be effective, relative to NIDA Online Information, in preventing/reducing drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and STI incidence in Hispanic adolescents over time and 2) Intervention effects will be partially mediated by family functioning for drug use and unprotected sexual behavior and by family functioning and unprotected sexual behavior for STI incidence.

"The Implementation, Adoption, and Sustainability of Ho'ouna Pono Project Summary/Abstract  Research has indicated that Native Hawaiian youth have significantly higher rates of drug use than their non-Hawaiian counterparts (e.g., Wong, Klingle, & Price, 2004; Mayeda, Hishinuma, Nishimura, Garcia- Santiago, & Mark, 2006; Nishimura, Hishinuma, & Goebert, 2013), and that these differences are particularly pronounced in rural settings (Saka, Takeuchi, Fagaragan, & Afaga, 2014). Despite these findings, there have been very few drug prevention programs developed and evaluated specifically for these youth (Edwards, Giroux, & Okamoto, 2010; Rehuher, Hiramatsu, & Helm, 2008). Further, efforts to address youth substance abuse have been poorly implemented and coordinated across the State of Hawai‘i (Waitzfelder, Engel, & Gilbert, 1998). Therefore, the purposes of this R34 proposal are to identify potential barriers or challenges to the implementation, adoption, and sustainability (IAS) of a culturally grounded, school-based drug prevention curriculum (Ho‘ouna Pono) across all public middle, intermediate, or multi-level schools on Hawai‘i Island, and to create a comprehensive, community-based IAS action plan for the curriculum. This will be accomplished through three specific aims. AIM 1 (Assessing Environmental Demands, Year 1) is to develop and validate an implementation, adoption, and sustainability inventory related to Ho‘ouna Pono, which will be theoretically informed by The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR; Damschroder & Hagedorn, 2011; Powell, Proctor, & Glass, 2014). The inventory will consist of items describing barriers or challenges to the successful adoption, implementation, and/or sustainability of Ho‘ouna Pono on Hawai‘i Island. AIM 2 (Response Enumeration, Year 2) is to systematically elicit implementation strategies (or solutions) to the most problematic and/or difficult barriers to the IAS of the curriculum in public schools on Hawai‘i Island, and to rank-order these solutions based on their perceived ability to address or overcome each of the barriers to IAS. AIM 3 (Action Plan, Year 3) is to create a community based and validated action plan based on the findings from Aims 1 and 2, which will be evaluated in a future NIDA R01 grant proposal focused on dissemination and implementation research in health. Project Narrative  Because Hawaiians or part-Hawaiians represent the largest Pacific Islander population in the U.S. (Harris & Jones, 2005) and have been shown to have significantly higher rates of drug use compared with other ethnic groups (Wu et al., 2013), research focused on drug prevention of these individuals is important to improve public health both in Hawai‘i and on the Mainland U.S. This study actively engages rural public schools and communities in assessing the implementation, adoption, and sustainability of the Ho‘ouna Pono drug prevention curriculum. The findings from this study will point to barriers and challenges to the successful implementation of evidence-based prevention curricula for rural, Pacific Islander, and indigenous communities, as well as to culturally grounded implementation strategies to promote the sustained public health impact of the curriculum.","The Implementation, Adoption, and Sustainability of Ho'ouna Pono",9912147,R34DA046735,"['Adoption ', ' Communities ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Glass ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' Interview ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Island ', ' Literature ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Administrator ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' cooking ', ' Hawaiian ', ' Hawaiian population ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Ground Substance Cytosol ', ' Ground Substance ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Indigenous ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' implementation trial ', ' youth substance abuse ', ' adolescent substance abuse ', ' implementation research ', ' dissemination research ', ' rural disparities ', ' Population ', ' Drug Prevention Program ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' 2-dimensional ', ' two-dimensional ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' implementation science ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' efficacy testing ', ' prevent substance use ', ' substance use prevention ', ' population health ', ' secondary analysis ', ' indigenous community ', ' rural locality ', ' rural place ', ' rural setting ', ' Native Hawaiian ', ' clinical implementation ', ' implementation strategy ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIDA,HAWAII PACIFIC UNIVERSITY,R34,2020,207485,0.08250259884231641
"Developing and Piloting a School Staff-Based Intervention to Reduce Alcohol and Drug Use Among Sexual Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Alcohol and drug use (e.g., tobacco and marijuana use) are major public health problems affecting large proportions of youth. Alcohol and drug use also disproportionately burden certain youth populations, such as sexual minority youth (SMY; i.e., adolescents who identify as gay/lesbian or bisexual, or who have same- gender sexual behaviors or attractions). Compared with heterosexual youth, SMY have up to 600% higher odds of lifetime drug and alcohol use. Despite these substantial disparities, few evidence-based interventions exist for reducing alcohol and drug use among SMY. Nevertheless, SMY who report having supportive adults at school, greater school connectedness, and lower bullying victimization have lower drug and alcohol use. Therefore, an intervention that trains school staff (e.g., teachers, principals, nurses, counselors) to better understand SMY, support SMY, and engage in positive bystander behaviors that protect SMY from bullying victimization may reduce sexual-orientation disparities in drug and alcohol use. Furthermore, many school staff desire to support SMY, but they report a lack of training as their primary impediment. To address these gaps, I will execute two Specific Aims. In Aim #1, I will develop an online e-learning intervention aimed at improving school staff’s knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy for supporting SMY. Using the intervention mapping approach, I will develop, user-test, and refine intervention materials by: conducting focus groups with a School Staff Advisory Board; performing usability tests via think aloud interviews with school staff; and collaborating with professional e-learning developers. In Aim #2, I will pilot test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of this school staff-based intervention using a two-armed cluster-randomized controlled trial. I will enroll high schools participating in the fully-funded survey infrastructure of the MetroWest Adolescent Health Survey (MWAHS), located outside Boston, Massachusetts, where sexual-orientation disparities in drug and alcohol use still exist. Biennially, the MWAHS administers surveys to all students in each school, providing ample student-level data. In tandem, I will collect new longitudinal survey data (baseline and 6-month follow-up) from all school staff within each enrolled school. This e-learning intervention is easily modifiable and economically scalable, making it apt for wide dissemination with the potential for population-level impact in reducing drug and alcohol use disparities. To successfully complete my research, I will acquire training in: (1) the development of stakeholder- informed interventions, particularly e-learning programs; (2) implementation science research; and (3) the design and analysis of experimental studies. Guided by a strong interdisciplinary mentorship team, my planned training activities include mentorship meetings, formal coursework, training institutes, scientific seminars, and research conferences. Upon successful completion of my research and training plans, I will be propelled towards achieving my long-term goal, which is to become an independent scientific researcher specializing in stakeholder-informed intervention science aimed at reducing drug and alcohol use disparities for SMY. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Institute of Medicine’s 2011 report titled “The Health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) People” calls for the development of evidence-based interventions for reducing sexual minority youth’s large and persistent disparities in drug and alcohol use. The goals of the proposed research are to develop and pilot test an e-learning intervention that trains school staff to better understand, support, and protect sexual minority youth, and this novel intervention is hypothesized to increase adult support and school connectedness and simultaneously decrease bullying victimization, drug use, and alcohol use among sexual minority youth. Given the dearth of published research on alcohol and drug use interventions for sexual minority youth, this project will provide novel scientific contributions that can help foster health equity for sexual minority youth.",Developing and Piloting a School Staff-Based Intervention to Reduce Alcohol and Drug Use Among Sexual Minority Youth,9928861,K01AA027564,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult

"Reducing Black Men's Drug Use and Co-Occurring Negative Mental and Physical Health Outcomes: Intersectionality, Social-Structural Stressors, and Protective Factors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Health inequities among Black men in the U.S. are stark. Drug use contributes to six of the top ten leading causes of death among Black men ages 18 to 54. Social-structural stressors such as discrimination, based on race or race and sexual identity, and drug use to cope with stress, are well-documented pathways to drug use among Black adults. Empirical evidence that drug use co-occurs with other negative health outcomes underscores an urgent public health need to examine drug use and other co-occurring negative health outcomes associated with social-structural stressors. Single-axis perspectives—either race or sexual identity— dominate drug use and health disparities research. Apart from HIV/AIDS research, research on the effects of social-structural stressors on Black men’s drug use and co-occurring negative health outcomes at the intersection of sexual identity (i.e., heterosexual, sexual minority) and socioeconomic position (SEP) is virtually nonexistent. Critical gaps also exist about how protective factors (e.g., resilience, religiosity, positive racial/sexual identity) influence the effects of social-structural stressors on Black men’s drug use and co- occurring negative health outcomes. To address these critical gaps, a longitudinal cross-lagged explanatory- sequential (QUANT→qual) mixed methods study is proposed to test, via structural equation modeling, a conceptual model of social-structural stressors, protective factors, and drug use (alcohol, marijuana, nicotine, illicit drug use) and co-occurring negative mental (e.g., psychological distress) and physical (e.g., blood pressure) health outcomes among Black men at the intersection of sexual identity and SEP. Purposive quota sampling will be used to recruit 960 Black men, ages 18-54, stratified by sexual identity and SEP (240/group) in Washington, DC. Phase I includes the collection of self-reported social-structural stressors, protective factors, drug use, and mental health data, and objective drug use (i.e., urine toxicology) and physical health (e.g., blood pressure) data at Time 1, and 3 months later at Time 2 (Aims 1, 2). Blood samples will be collected at Time 2 only to assess cardiovascular disease biomarkers (e.g., total cholesterol). Phase II includes 4 focus groups with 6-8 Phase I participants (total n = 24 to 32) purposively sampled to explain Phase I results (Aim 3). Phase III involves a synthesis and validity assessment of the quantitative and qualitative results (Aim 3). The proposed research uses intersectionality, social-structural stress, and resilience theoretical frameworks to advance new and important knowledge about the extent to which social-structural stressors and protective factors influence drug use and co-occurring negative health outcomes among Black men at the intersection of sexual identity and SEP. This intersectional focus represents a paradigmatic shift from conventional single-axis and one-size-fits-all intervention approaches. The significance of the proposed research lies in the expected outcome of the future development of multi-level (i.e., individual and social-structural) interventions to reduce drug use and promote mental and physical health among Black men at different intersectional positions of risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed explanatory-sequential (QUANT→qual) mixed-methods longitudinal cross-lagged study is relevant to public health because, in alignment with the NIDA Epidemiology Research Branch’s mission, it advances new knowledge about the effects of social-structural stressors and protective factors on drug use and co-occurring negative mental and physical health outcomes for Black men at the intersection of sexual identity and socioeconomic position (SEP). A significant benefit of the proposed research is that it will have broad translational importance for future health disparities research and interventions designed to reduce drug use and health disparities among and between populations at multiple marginalized intersectional positions (e.g., race, gender, sexual identity, and SEP). The project advances new horizons about the effects of intersectional positions and related social-structural stressors and protective factors on drug use and co- occurring negative mental and physical health outcomes that conventional single-axis (e.g., either race or sexual identity) approaches obscure.","Reducing Black Men's Drug Use and Co-Occurring Negative Mental and Physical Health Outcomes: Intersectionality, Social-Structural Stressors, and Protective Factors",9906886,R01DA045773,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Homicide ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nicotine ', ' Political Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxicology ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Washington ', ' Gender ', ' Police ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Unintentional Injury ', ' Accidental Injury ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Area ', ' incarcerated ', ' incarceration ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Phase ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Economic Factors ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Gays ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dependence ', ' Pattern ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social position ', ' social standing ', ' Social status ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' MSM ', ' men who have sex with other men ', ' men who have sex with men ', ' virtual ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' stress resilience ', ' Population ', "" men's health "", ' male health ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' sexual minority ', ' health data ', ' illicit drug use ', ' racial identity ', ' intersectionalities ', ' intersectionality ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' sexual identity ', ' social factors ', ' social structural ', ' socio-structural ', ' sociostructural ', ' social structure ', ' ']",NIDA,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,634836,0.10473788718971687
"Ending HIV/AIDS among People Who Use Drugs: Overcoming Challenges This is a proposal to renew funding of the Center for Drug Use and HIV Research (CDUHR) for years 21- 25. Recent advances in HIV biomedical and behavioral science have been shown to reduce HIV incidence and allow HIV-positive persons to reach near-normal lifespans. These achievements have led UNAIDS, the US and several local governments to propose strategies for “Ending the HIV Epidemic”. Notwithstanding these successes, attaining this goal among people who use drugs (PWUD) will require addressing a number of important existing barriers. The overall theme of this renewal is “Ending HIV/AIDS among People who use Drugs: Overcoming Challenges”. We define Ending HIV/AIDS as reducing new infections and increasing the proportion of PWUD who are virally suppressed. To accomplish this, we have identified these research priorities, which directly address the most significant challenges: (1) Devise new strategies to overcome emerging and persistent barriers to ending HIV/AIDS among PWUD. Barriers include recent increases in prescription opioid misuse, which have given rise to a new generation of heroin user and injectors, and lack of attention to the key role of substance use in new infections in men who have sex with men and heterosexuals. HIV-positive PWUD also experience disparities all along the continuum of HIV care, including delayed diagnosis, lower retention in care, delayed initiation of ART and poorer disease outcomes. (2) Conduct research on effective ways to broadly implement evidence-based interventions. HIV prevention and care programs for PWUD do not exist in many regions of the US and the rest of the world where they are needed most, and they are rarely implemented at public-health scale. (3) Develop new, innovative models of prevention and treatment interventions to address substance-use related disparities in HIV infection and treatment outcomes that take into account the complex, multilevel nature of HIV among PWUD.  We have made significant changes in our scope and structure for this renewal, and we will achieve our aims through five Cores, an Administrative Core and four Research Support Cores: (1) Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Theory, (2) Transdisciplinary Research Methods, (3) Dissemination and Implementation, and (4) Pilot Projects and Mentoring. These Cores support our research base and affiliated investigators to conduct cutting-edge science and enhance synergy across investigators from multiple disciplines, thereby leading to contributions to the field that are beyond what the individual projects could have achieved. In addition to the many successful initiatives that have been developed over CDUHR's history, new activities were added to respond to the evolving needs of our investigators. Also, in addition to our ongoing commitment to train new investigators to conduct high-impact research, we will collaborate with investigators in areas where HIV epidemics are occurring among PWUD (in rural and middle America, and in eastern Europe and Asia), building on our collective knowledge and expertise to advance toward Ending HIV/AIDS in those regions. Project Narrative A critical time has been reached in the course of the HIV epidemic, when the possibility to end HIVAIDS has been raised. Despite advances in biomedical treatments and behavioral interventions to reduce HIV incidence and its impact, people who use drugs (PWUD) have poorer outcomes. The Center provides a research infrastructure to enhance the productivity, synergy and impact of the research by affiliated investigators working to End HIV/AIDS among PWUD.",Ending HIV/AIDS among

"Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for Drug Abuse and HIV (Ce-PIM) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application is for a competing renewal of the Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for HIV and Drug Abuse, a NIDA P30 Center of Excellence. The number of new HIV cases in the US remains stable at 56,000 per year and continues to disproportionately affect some groups, including young men who have sex with men (YMSM), especially from racial/ethnic minorities. The purpose of this methodology center is to develop new methodologies that can be used by federal and local agencies and communities to reduce HIV incidence. Biomedical interventions and strategies, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), rapid testing for HIV and early and consistent treatment for persons who are HIV positive (Treatment as Prevention, TasP) have been shown to have high efficacy and effectiveness in reducing HIV transmission, but there remains a giant gap between what research knows and what services needed to reduce population level incidence of HIV. The major premise of this application is that the effective biomedical to reduce HIV incidence and disparities are in hand, but success will only be achieved when they are implemented in ways that meet individual, community, and health care delivery system needs. This methods proposal addresses this major gap between research and practice through implementation science and methodology, focusing on innovative ways to address the complex, mulitilevel interactions needed to implement HIV prevention programs effectively. Two Cores, an Administrative Core and an Innovative Implementation Methods Core for HIV and Drug Abuse will carry out this work.  Aim 1 is to develop innovative methods to maximize the impact of implementation research in HIV prevention. We do this through an extended set of systems science and engineering methods that focus on improving the measurement of implementation, the modeling of implementation strategies, and the testing of implementation strategies through rigorous trials. Five qualifying grants support this work.  Aim 2 is to apply these innovative methods to close the gap between existing research, policy, and practice for HIV prevention. In addition to working closely with our five qualifying grants, we work locally with municipal Departments of Public Health and the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) HIV programs to identify and prioritize gaps in knowledge, find optimal implementation strategies for reduction of HIV transmission, and design the next large implementation trials.  Aim 3 is to disseminate methods and train/mentor leaders at the intersection of HIV prevention, implementation science, and drug abuse fields to improve implementation of HIV prevention programs. This involves mentoring the early career researchers, publishing, and providing training to networks of HIV and drug abuse researchers. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are numerous rigorously evaluated prevention programs involving biomedical interventions for preventing HIV that have demonstrated impact in efficacy and effectiveness trials. Pre-exposure prophylaxis, HIV testing, and early and consistent antiretroviral treatment have high potential for preventing HIV infections, but these are yet to be implemented sufficiently in racial/ethnic minority communities. This Ce-PIM addresses the critical methods gaps that are holding back the movement of these programs from research to practice.",Center for Prevention Implementation Methodology for Drug Abuse and HIV

"Drug use disparities among Hispanics: elucidating the complex interactions between socio-cultural, neurocognitive and drug use-related factors Project Summary/Abstract: Hispanic adolescents are disproportionately affected by drug use and its consequences. This is reflected in high rates of school dropouts, arrest for drug possession, alcohol, drug use disorders, disability and drug related crash injuries and fatalities. Mounting evidence suggest that impaired neurocognitive functioning, exposure to early, severe, or chronic social disadvantage, and stress related to conflicting cultural practices, independently predict adverse drug use outcomes. Yet, studies employing an integrated approach to explore how these factors interact to increase or decrease the risk of experiencing adverse drug use consequences are limited. Therefore, the immediate and overarching goal of this K01 application is to receive intensive, supervised career-development training on the intersection between addiction neuroscience and social and cross-cultural research applied to drug use research that will enable me to pursue a line of independent research on drug use disparities. In this application, I propose to investigate how socio- cultural, neurocognitive and drug use related factors interact to explain the adverse outcomes seen in the Hispanic population. The specific aims of the proposed project include: 1) To determine whether neurocognitive factors (e.g., decision-making, episodic memory), mediate the associations between socio-cultural factors (e.g., early, severe, or chronic socio-economic disadvantage, ethnic discrimination, acculturative stress, Hispanic cultural values), and drug use outcomes (e.g. transition from use to drug use disorders, drug use trajectories, driving under the influence of drugs - DIU); 2) To examine whether socio-cultural factors moderate the associations between neurocognitive factors and drug use. These goals will be achieved by leveraging data, participants, and resources from an ongoing longitudinal study (parent study) that assesses decision-making and episodic memory in trajectories to cannabis addiction (R01DA031176), and interviewing a sub-sample of young Hispanics participating in the parent study and their parents or legal guardians (n=200 dyads). The proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will build on my expertise in drug use epidemiology with advanced training in: addiction neuroscience, social and cross-cultural research on drug use disparities, interdisciplinary research on cognitive neuroscience and socio-cultural research, advanced statistical methods for analyzing longitudinal data, and responsible conduct of research. Overseeing this training is my primary mentor Dr. Raul Gonzalez, an expert in addiction neuroscience, and my co-mentor Dr. Mario De La Rosa, an expert in cross-cultural research and drug use disparities. The proposed K01, which is responsive to two of the two priority focus areas identified in the 2016-2020 NIDA Strategic Plan, will provide me with the resources, training, mentoring and knowledge needed to establish myself as a scientist with expertise on the intersection between addiction neuroscience and public health, and to develop a long-term independent transdisciplinary research program aimed at reducing and eliminating drug use disparities across and within minority populations. Project narrative: Socio-cultural and neurocognitive factors are important and potentially modifiable determinants of drug use, yet research examining the how these factors interact to explain drug use disparities is scarce. The proposed K01 training will support a Hispanic new and early stage investigator to become an independent researcher and a leader in interdisciplinary research on drug use disparities. Specifically, the outlined project will contribute to understand how social factors, Hispanic cultural values, neurocognitive processes and drug use related factors interact to explain the adverse drug use outcomes seen in the growing and heterogeneous Hispanic population, which is essential to design effective drug use preventive interventions.","Drug use disparities among Hispanics:

"Predictors of hemorrhage among patients on direct acting oral anticoagulants ABSTRACT: Direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOAC), specifically rivaroxaban (RIVA) and apixaban (APX) have emerged as the most commonly used oral anticoagulants, replacing warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, hemorrhage (HEM) is the most feared adverse effect and is a critical barrier to institution of these efficacious therapies. Anticoagulants have consistently ranked as the top offenders for adverse drug event related hospitalizations in the US, with HEM accounting for ~80% of adm is s ions . To predict HEM risk, investigators have developed clinical prediction rules (CPRs) focused mainly on warfarin- related HEM. However, the lack of CPRs for DOAC-related HEM, the variable inclusion of antiplatelets, the lack of assessment of gastro-protective therapies or interacting drugs (influencing APX and RIVA pharmacokinetics), the lack of assessment of risk across the spectrum of kidney function, and the scarce (to nil) representation of Blacks are critical knowledge gaps. Identifying factors contributing to the increased HEM risk among APX and RIVA users and elucidating their impact (effect size) is of critical importance In this application, we aim to identify predictors of HEM risk and define the impact (effect size) in a clinical cohort of medically complex, racially diverse patients on APX (n=1500) and RIVA (N=1500) and develop CPRs for APX-related-HEM and RIVA-related-HEM. Through Aim 1, we will identify and assess the influence of predictors (e.g. demographics, comorbidities) on risk of HEM. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the influence concomitant use of antiplatelet therapy, gastro-protective therapies (proton pump inhibitors and H2 Receptor Blockers) and interacting drugs (amiodarone, diltiazem and verapamil) on risk of HEM among RIVA and APX users. Aim 3 will focus on determining the influence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) spectrum on HEM risk and elucidate steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) across the spectrum of kidney function among RIVA and APX users. Finally, Aim 4 will incorporate results from Aims 1-3 into building CPRs to personalize the prediction of HEM among APX and RIVA users. The prediction models will validated in an independent cohort (n=500 APX, n=500 RIVA). Our focus on complex patients seen in clinical practice with robust representation of understudied patients (Blacks, patients with moderate and severe-CKD) and assessment of common co-medications improves generalizability and applicability to real world patients. Public health Narrative: Identification of factors that predict risk of hemorrhage among patients taking direct acting oral anticoagulants is vital as it can help identify patients who stand to benefit or be harmed by anticoagulants drugs. The integration of these predictors into the current treatment approach can help provide personalized treatment, improving outcomes for the individual patient. The increasing burden of atrial fibrillation in the US and the world, highlight the immense potential of such research in facilitating the realization of tangible individual and population health benefits.",Predictors of hemorrhage among patients on direct acting oral anticoagulants,9863657,R01HL092173,"['Accounting ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Amiodarone ', ' Anticoagulants ', ' Anticoagulant Agents ', ' Anticoagulant Drugs ', ' blood thinner ', ' thrombopoiesis inhibitor ', ' Anticoagulation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Diltiazem ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Genotype ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' Bleeding ', ' blood loss ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Ions ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Patients ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Phenotype ', ' Protective Agents ', ' Protective Drugs ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Verapamil ', ' Iproveratril ', ' Warfarin ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Anticoagulant Chemotherapy ', ' Anticoagulant therapy ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Individual ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Exposure to ', ' Proton Pump Inhibitors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' Equation ', ' cohort ', ' H2 Receptors ', ' Histamine H2 Receptors ', ' H2 gene ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Drug Interactions ', ' Prevention ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' criminal offender ', ' offender ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Pharmacodynamics ', ' response ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Institution ', ' Dose ', ' International ', ' Seminal ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' clinical practice ', ' population health ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' clinical predictors ', ' genetic predictors ', ' Adverse drug event ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' individual patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' recruit ', ' Individualized Predictors ', ' individualized predictions ', ' personalized predictors ', ' personalized predictions ', ' risk for stroke ', ' risk of stroke ', ' stroke risk ', ' PK/PD ', ' pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics ', ' venous thromboembolism ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2020,742075,-0.0026174372527379267
"Evaluating the Effectiveness of an eHealth EBI for Latino Youth in Primary Care Hispanic adolescents in the U.S. experience significant health disparities, particularly as it relates to drug use, unsafe sexual behaviors and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In spite of these disparities, a paucity of effective preventive interventions exist for Hispanic adolescents, and even fewer have been disseminated widely (IOM/NRC, 2009). Given that primary care settings are increasingly becoming the entry-point through which parents bring youth with behavioral health concerns, adolescent primary care settings represent ideal, yet underutilized, settings in which to disseminate evidence-based preventive interventions. Preventive interventions which target risk and protective factors within the family, the most proximal and fundamental social system influencing human behavior, have been found to be among the most efficacious interventions in preventing and reducing drug use and sexual risk behaviors.  Familias Unidas is a Hispanic-specific, family-based intervention found to be efficacious and effective in preventing and reducing drug use, sexual risk behaviors, and self-reported STIs. Familias Unidas has been cited by the Institute of Medicine report on Preventing, Emotional, and Behavioral among Young People as ready for broad dissemination (IOM/NRC, 2009). To date, however, Familias Unidas has been only tested for efficacy and effectiveness in schools and has not been evaluated for efficacy/effectiveness in primary care. We have adapted and evaluated Familias Unidas for online delivery; successfully retaining 80% of Hispanic parents and their youth (recruited from schools) in the online, eHealth adaptation of Familias Unidas. We have also demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of delivering eHealth Familas Unidas in primary care.  Evaluating innovative eHealth family-based interventions for Hispanic youth whose feasibility and acceptability is established in primary care settings is timely and of high public health significance. Therefore, the proposed study's overarching aim is to evaluate the relative effectiveness and cost effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas, compared to a referral to the National Institute Drug Abuse’s (NIDA) online information page for parents of Hispanic youth (referred hereafter as NIDA Online Information). To test the effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas Primary Care in preventing drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and STIs in a universal sample of Hispanic youth, this study will randomize 456 Hispanic youth and their parents to eHealth Familias Unidas or to NIDA Online Information. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months post baseline. Study hypotheses are that: 1) eHealth Familias Unidas will be effective, relative to NIDA Online Information, in preventing/reducing drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and STI incidence in Hispanic adolescents over time and 2) Intervention effects will be partially mediated by family functioning for drug use and unprotected sexual behavior and by family functioning and unprotected sexual behavior for STI incidence. The cost effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas over a three year follow up will also be estimated. The proposed study will evaluate the effectiveness of an eHealth adaptation of an evidence-based face-to- face preventive intervention for Hispanic youth, in preventing drug use, sexual risk behaviors, and sexually transmitted diseases in primary care settings. The knowledge expected to be gained in this study will have strong implications for the delivery of prevention interventions in primary care, as well as contribute to the reduction of drug and sexual risk behavior related to disparities seen in Hispanic youth.",Evaluating the Effectiveness of an eHealth EBI for Latino Youth in Primary Care,10140857,R01DA040756,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' bedsonia ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Counselor ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Family ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Leadership ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Parents ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Staff Attitudes ', ' Time ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Emotional disorder ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' High-Risk Sex ', ' Unprotected Sex ', ' condomless intercourse ', ' condomless sex ', ' unprotected intercourse ', ' Unsafe Sex ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' junior high ', ' middle school ', ' junior high school ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' drug addiction prevention ', ' drug use prevention ', ' prevent drug abuse ', ' prevent drug addiction ', ' prevent drug use ', ' drug abuse prevention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' intervention effect ', ' efficacy testing ', ' e-Health ', ' eHealth ', ' parent-adolescent communication ', ' relative effectiveness ', ' relative cost ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' sex risk behavior ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' cost estimation ', ' cost estimate ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,98895,0.07929300962446643
"Neuroscience, Immunology, Social Adversity and the Roots of Addictive Behaviors: Toward a New Framework for Drug Use Etiology and Prevention PROJECT SUMMARY: Overall Center The Center for Translational and Prevention Science (CTAPS; P20 MH068666, P30 DA027827) has been funded continuously since 2003 to advance next-generation basic and preventive investigations of risk, resilience, and drug use among African American young people living in resource poor communities in the southeastern US. CTAPS has pioneered research demonstrating how exposures to economic and social adversity promote drug use through their effects on neurobiological and peripheral systems. Of particular importance, research sponsored by CTAPS also has demonstrated the promise of family-centered drug use prevention programming in shielding young people from these neurobiological risks. At present, transformative progress in the prevention of addictive behavior among populations exposed to chronic stress has been hampered significantly by the lack of (a) integrative theoretical frameworks that generate hypotheses regarding the risk and resilience mechanisms that connect social adversity to addictive behavior and cardiometabolic risk, (b) infrastructures that can collect model driven data on multiple neurocognitive, peripheral biological, and behavioral systems associated with chronic stress, and (c) transdisciplinary teams that can integrate these data into the design and evaluation of prevention programs. The theoretical framework of the proposed P50 Research Center of Excellence is a next generation, neuroimmune network (NIN) model that CTAPS scientists developed to better describe the ways in which exposure to social adversity predispose young people to the onset and escalation of diverse forms of addictive behaviors. The NIN model specifies stress-induced alterations in the transactions between peripheral inflammation and neurocognitive systems that subserve emotion regulation in the development of addictive behavior vulnerability. As a P50 Center, we propose to build on and expand CTAPS’ pioneering work on (a) the biological and neurocognitive contributors to addictive behaviors that drive many drug use and health disparities African Americans’ experience and (b) the potential of family-centered prevention programming to ameliorate the influence of growing up in chronically stressful contexts. We will leverage an established team of investigators from diverse disciplines and an established infrastructure for testing transdisciplinary hypotheses. This infrastructure includes efficient, established pipelines connecting P50 research project (RP) and pilot study investigators to intellectual resources, wet labs, a state-of-the-science imaging facility, and a world class platform for processing imaging data. We will implement three innovative, thematically integrated RPs. RPs, innovative pilot projects, an expanded national resource system, and investigator development activities will be supported through our infrastructure system composed of a Research Support Core, an Administrative Core, and a Pilot Core.

"Stigma, Risk Behaviors and Health Care among HIV-infected Russian People Who Inject Drugs PROJECT ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic restrictions to reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 have exacerbated global inequities. These restrictions may have particularly limited engagement in care of HIV-positive people who inject drugs (PWID). This longitudinal project aims to qualitatively assess evolving consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on health risks and risk behaviors of HIV-positive PWID; and described the impact of stigma on HIV-positive PWID during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will leverage access to the SCRIPT (R00DA041245) study population (n=108); SCRIPT is a community-based RCT testing the feasibility of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy as a stigma intervention among PWID with HIV who are not connected to addiction or HIV care in St. Petersburg, Russia. The SCRIPT study population provides a unique opportunity to understand pandemic impacts on substance use and HIV risk behaviors, as well as health care utilization among community-based HIV-positive PWID. This project will inform rights-based, gender-inclusive preparedness strategies to mitigate adverse pandemic effects and prepare the key population of HIV-positive PWID for future pandemic situations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The COVID-19 lockdowns may have worsened engagement in care of HIV-positive people who injection drugs (PWID) and exacerbated existing stigma and discrimination, limiting this population’s human rights.

"2/2 Drug Development and Capacity Building: A UCR/CoH-CCC Partnership ABSTRACT Cancer drugs in the United States are almost exclusively developed by, tested in, and optimized for European- Americans. Disparities in U.S. drug development are the result of long-standing inequalities that occur throughout the entire drug discovery pipeline. Only a small number of basic, translational and clinical scientists are Latino/Hispanic or Black/African-American. Less than 2-5% of trial participants are Latino/Hispanic or Black/African-American. Yet, in spite of a lack of data, new drugs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and subsequently prescribed for Latino/Hispanic or Black/African-American patients, without sufficient testing. It is unacceptable, especially in this era of the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), that currently our drugs are developed by, and optimized for, only for an exclusive segment of our citizens. We seek to shift this paradigm by strengthening the existing partnership between University of California at Riverside (UCR) and City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center (CoH-CCC).

"AIDS Linked to the IntraVenous Experience (ALIVE) ABSTRACT In this competing renewal, we propose to continue a 30-year cohort of people who inject drugs (PWID). Since 1988, the AIDS Linked to the IntraVenous Experience (ALIVE) study has followed >5200 PWID in a community-based cohort in Baltimore, MD, providing critical insight into the natural and treated course of HIV among urban predominantly minority, disadvantaged PWID. Our team has been highly productive (107 publications in past cycle) and will continue cutting-edge investigations into high HIV/AIDS priority research questions, while serving as a foundation for an array of HIV-related epidemiological and pathogenesis studies. The opioid crisis across the US continues and has not abated in Baltimore. Baltimore has one of the highest US overdose rates and is experiencing demographic and behavioral transitions in the population most affected by opioid use -- from one that is primarily male, older and minority -- to one that affects more women, younger and white individuals. At the same time, there has also been a shift in the expression of HIV infection among PWID. Much of the population of PWID that the ALIVE study has traditionally followed is aging into the decade of life where HIV and its treatment are complicated by the onset of other chronic age-associated health conditions; in 2016, 40% of our cohort had >2 non-communicable diseases (NCD). At the same time <50% of our HIV-positive participants currently have suppressed HIV viral load highlighting a need for a more holistic approach to HIV care one that more broadly incorporates NCDs. Our proposed continuation will address the spectrum of the intersecting HIV and opioid epidemics with an eye towards understanding the impact of opioid use and HIV across the PWID life course. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To monitor temporal trends in the opioid epidemic comparing HIV infected and uninfected PWID across the lifespan, including characterization of shifting drug profiles and context over time and their impact on the incidence of fatal and non-fatal overdose, HIV and HCV infection and mortality. 2) To evaluate the dynamic associations between HIV care continuum outcomes and prevalence and control of NCDs (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) and their joint impact on morbidity, mortality and quality of life; and 3) To continue to provide a platform for independently-funded investigations of HIV and drug use. To achieve these aims, we will 1) continue follow-up of HIV positive and negative PWID (~1500); 2) open recruitment once; and 3) evolve our data collection methods to include novel field-based, mHealth and drug testing assessments. The ALIVE cohort is unique in that it comprises a community-based PWID population of both genders with significant representation of African-Americans who are both in and out of medical care; these populations have been underrepresented in HIV and drug use research. Given the scientific rigor of the proposed methods, existing infrastructure, experienced investigators and multiple NIH-funded ancillary studies, we anticipate continued success and substantial scientific impact in the future. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Many urban settings including Baltimore face dual opioid and HIV epidemics, one among older predominantly minority PWID who are disproportionately affected with HIV, and an emerging epidemic among younger white individuals living in suburban Baltimore who are at high risk for HIV. The findings from this study will inform both interventions targeting new PWID populations at risk for HIV as well as programs to optimize engagement of PWID in care and treatment for not only for HIV but for non-communicable diseases which will improve overall health and well-being.",AIDS Linked to the IntraVenous Experience (ALIVE),9905504,U01DA036297,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Baltimore ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hepatitis C ', ' HCV infection ', ' Hepatitis C virus infection ', ' Hepatitis, Viral, Non-A, Non-B, Parenterally-Transmitted ', ' Hepatitus C ', ' hep C ', ' hepatitis non A non B ', ' non A, non B hepatitis ', ' non-A, non-B hepatitis ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Learning ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Liver diseases ', ' Hepatic Disorder ', ' hepatic disease ', ' hepatopathy ', ' liver disorder ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Lung diseases ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' disease of the lung ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' lung disorder ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' male ', ' Medical Records ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"Biomarkers for Dysbiosis-Related HIV-Associated Cognitive Disorders among Persons Who Inject Drugs in Puerto Rico ABSTRACT The current opioid injection incidence in the United States has risen to epidemic levels and is associated with increased risk of HIV-1 transmission and disease progression as well as with other infections in several US states. Given that most HIV+ people who inject drugs (PWID) are now likely to receive anti-retroviral therapy, traditional bio-markers such as HIV viral load and CD4 counts are unlikely to provide a comprehensive assessment of disease progression especially as it affects neurocognitive performance. New biomarkers are needed to track the effects of ongoing HIV infection as it impacts neurocognitive functions. Candidate biomarkers can be found in the interaction between HIV infection, dysbiosis, microbial translocation and systematic inflammation. HIV-1 infection is associated with lymphoid depletion in tissues underlying the gut epithelium, allowing microbial products to transduce into the parenchyma where they act as potent inducers of systemic inflammation. Even when HIV-1 viral load is suppressed by anti-retroviral treatment, chronic immune activation resulting from dysbiosis and translocation can persist. Opioid use also induces gut dysbiosis and supports bacterial translocation. The resulting inappropriate immune activation in PWID may enhance HIV-1 replication, lead to premature aging of T cells, and promote HIV disease progression, including exacerbated HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND). A more comprehensive set of markers is therefore needed to better understand the course of HIV infection among people who inject drugs (PWID)—biomarkers that reflect the combined physiologic impact of ongoing injection drug use and a range of biomic changes that can exaggerate and reinforce the cumulative impact of physiological effects on mental health. The overall objective of our proposed study is to advance the understanding of the effects of HIV infection and injection drug use on the microbiome, with the goal of discovering biomarkers for neurological disease progression among PWID that are related to chronic inflammation and dysbiosis coupled inflammation. Our highly experienced research team will make use of a well-established cohort of PWID in Puerto Rico—a region with historically high levels of injection drug use and an HIV incidence rate that is disproportionately associated with drug use. A prospective, multi-cohort longitudinal study will allow repeated measures from the study population and compare them with similar measures from control groups of HIV negative PWID and HIV-1 infected non-drug users from the same location. This longitudinal evaluation will allow our team to test the hypothesis that HIV-1 infection in PWID intensifies dysbiosis and inflammation which, in turn, exacerbates HIV replication, HAND and HIV treatment failures. We expect that this hypothesis, if true, will have important implications for the emerging drug epidemic in remainder of the United States. In addition to meeting the goals of RFA 18-023, this project will contribute to NIDA and OBSSR's strategic plans for research that bridges pre-clinical and socio-behavioral research, and is responsive to the NIH-wide mandate of improving minority health and reducing health disparities in the United States. NARRATIVE Given the high numbers of new injectors emerging from the rising opioid epidemic, a more comprehensive set of biomarkers is needed to fully understand neurocognitive impacts of HIV infection in people who inject drugs (PWID) in the United States today. This project advances the search for novel biomarkers by examining the links between HIV infection, dysbiosis, microbial translocation, and systemic inflammation among HIV-1 infected PWID in Puerto Rico as these factors predict the neurocognitive disorders known as HAND (HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders). A prospective, multi-cohort longitudinal study will allow repeated measures from the study population and compare them with similar measures from control groups of HIV negative PWID and HIV- 1 infected non-drug users from the same location.",Biomarkers for Dysbiosis-Related HIV-Associated Cognitive Disorders among Persons Who Inject Drugs in Puerto Rico,9949662,R01DA047823,"['Affect ', ' Cognition Disorders ', ' cognitive disease ', ' cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive syndrome ', ' Control Groups ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Epidemic ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HIV-1 ', ' HIV-I ', ' HIV1 ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kentucky ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Maine ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest US ', ' Morbidity -
